{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t80\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, where do I start? Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It looks like a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT29, etc.) can be replaced by a combination of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are the lowercase 't's followed by numbers, which I guess represent terminal symbols, and uppercase 'N's followed by numbers might be the non-terminals. Wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see S \u2192 NT29 NT21. That's two non-terminals. Then NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, again two non-terminals. NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72, etc. But some of the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals with a 't' followed by numbers, like NT0 \u2192 't93', NT28 \u2192 't37', etc.\n\nThe string I need to check is \"t80\". So I need to see if the start symbol S can generate this string through a series of applicable productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So, to generate \"t80\", I need to see if both NT29 and NT21 can derive a string that combines to \"t80\". But wait, \"t80\" is a single terminal symbol, so perhaps the entire left-hand side of the first production S \u2192 NT29 NT21 needs to resolve to \"t80\", but that would require NT29 producing the first part and NT21 producing the second part. But \"t80\" is a single symbol, so maybe NT29 produces \"t80\" and NT21 produces nothing? But that doesn't make sense because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Each step in the derivation produces exactly one non-terminal or two non-terminals. So each non-terminal must be expanded until it reaches terminals. Therefore, S \u2192 NT29 NT21 means that in the derivation, S produces two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. So for S to produce \"t80\", both NT29 and NT21 would need to produce, respectively, the parts of \"t80\". But wait, \"t80\" is a single token, so how can that be achieved?\n\nWait, I think I might be misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe the start symbol S is at the root, and each production combines the non-terminals, which then combine their own derivations. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21 means that in the derivation, NT29 and NT21 are both expanded and their results are concatenated. Therefore, the string \"t80\" must be the concatenation of the strings produced by NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo, I need to see if NT29 can derive a string that ends with something, and NT21 can derive the remaining part to make \"t80\". Alternatively, perhaps NT29 and NT21 can produce overlapping parts or together form \"t80\".\n\nLooking at the productions, let me see which non-terminals derive to 't80'. Scanning through, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 't93' (so NT0 produces 't93')\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\nWait, no. Wait, looking again: NT58 \u2192 't20', NT28 \u2192 't37', NT26 \u2192 't13', NT24 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't80', let me check the productions that end with 't80'. Looking through the right-hand sides of the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through each production, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that directly produces 't80'. Let me check all the productions where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't93'\n- NT13 \u2192 't50'\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT51 \u2192 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't80'\n- NT62 \u2192 't1' (wait, no, NT62 \u2192 't1' is not the case.

{"custom_id":"request-8","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the string `t13` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding what each non-terminal and terminal symbol represents.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar rules, most of the non-terminals end up producing 't' followed by some numbers. Some non-terminals directly produce 't' with a number, like NT52 \u2192 't97' and NT13 \u2192 't50'. So I think each 't' followed by a number might correspond to a specific production.\n\nThe target string is `t13`. So I need to see if `t13` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can only go to NT29 followed by NT21, as per S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first step is to derive `t13`, I need to see if `t13` can come from NT29 and NT21, but wait, or maybe NT29 and NT21 each produce something, and their concatenation is `t13`.\n\nWait, actually, no. Each production produces a string of terminals and non-terminals, and the string is the concatenation of the strings produced by each non-terminal in the production. So if S \u2192 NT29 NT21, then the string generated would be the concatenation of what NT29 produces and what NT21 produces.\n\nBut we're looking for a string that's a single 't13' character. That seems unlikely because typically, each rule would produce multiple 't's or more complex structures. However, perhaps in this case, some non-terminals produce a single 't' with a specific number.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT13 \u2192 't50', which would produce \"t50\" as a string. But our target is \"t13\", so perhaps there's a non-terminal that produces 't13' directly? Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT producing 't13'. Wait, there's NT13 \u2192 't50' and NT19 \u2192 't15' as per some rules. Maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT33 \u2192 't23', which still doesn't match. Let me think differently. Maybe the derivation of S can result in the string being built by concatenating several 't's with numbers. But since our string is only one 't13', perhaps that's possible if one of the paths leads to NT producing 't13' directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some of the non-terminals can produce 't13' through a series of steps. Let's think if any rules produce 't13'. Looking through, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't13'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only 't's are like 't13', 't50', etc. So NT13 \u2192 't50', which produces \"t50\". Hmm, but our target is 't13'. So if S can derive `t50` as part of a production, but not 't13', then perhaps 't13' is not in the language.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the derivation works. Each NT's production is a sequence of other NTs or terminals. So if S is NT29 NT21, and each NT can produce a terminal, the concatenated result is the combination of their terminals.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string will be the concatenation of what NT29 produces and NT21 produces.\n\n2. So I need to see what NT29 and NT21 produce. If both produce just 't*' where 't*' adds up, perhaps they produce single 't's, but looking through the rules, perhaps NT29 produces 't48' (from NT29 \u2192 't48') and NT21 might produce something else. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT24 \u2192 't24', which would produce \"t24\". NT21 \u2192 't72' according to some rules.\n\nWait, NT21 \u2192 't72'. So let's see:\n\nIf NT29 \u2192 't48', and NT21 \u2192 't72', then their concatenation would be \"t48t72\", which is not our target. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT29 and NT21 can produce other NTs that can produce 't13'. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals might ultimately produce a single 't' with a number. For example, NT53? Wait, no NT53. Let me list all the NTs again.\n\nLooking through, NT39 \u2192 't80', NT33 \u2192 't23', etc. Doesn't seem to have a path to 't13'. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the deeper productions. Let me pick NT29 and NT21 and see what they can produce.\n\nStarting with NT29: the rules for NT29 are... let me check. Oh wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT29 producing anything except perhaps in the initial list? Wait, looking back, no. The initial part lists some of the rules, perhaps not all. Wait, let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out all the possible paths. It's a bit time-consuming, but let's try to see if any NT can reach 't13' through their rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only NT that produces 't13' directly is NT19 \u2192 't15', but that's 't15', not 't13'. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about NT62? The rules for NT62 are: NT62 \u2192 't1' \u2192 something? Wait, no. Let me check. \n\nLooking at NT62: the rules include NT62 \u2192 NT1 NT24. So if NT1 can produce a terminal, then that might lead somewhere. Wait, NT1: the rule is NT1 \u2192 't73', right? Because in the list, NT1 \u2192 't73'. So if NT62 can be broken down into NT1 NT24, and NT1 is 't73', and NT24 can produce 't24', then the production would be 't73t24'.\n\nBut our target is 't13', so that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nWhat about NT26? The rules for NT26 include NT26 \u2192 't13' as per some. Let's check: yes, looking at the grammar, under NT26, there's a rule NT26 \u2192 't13'. So NT26 can produce 't13'.\n\nSo, if I can get NT26 as part of the derivation, then it can produce 't13'. Now, how can NT26 be derived? Looking back, in the grammar:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72\n\nAlso, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n\nAnd other rules, but wait, in the list, the production NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72, but then also another production: Wait, let me check.\n\nThe grammar rules for NT26 are:\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nWait, but that's correct. Wait, did I miss any? The provided grammar lists several rules for NT26 but I'll confirm again. As in:\n\nThe user provides:\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n... etc.\n\nBut according to the provided rules, NT26 has several production options, including NT26 \u2192 't13' as one. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has certain structural properties that might make parsing easier.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and S directly produces NT29 NT21. So, the string must be generated by expanding S into NT29 and NT21, then further expanding those non-terminals until I reach the terminals (t and numbers). The string given is two terminals: t91 and t63.

So the grammar must have a way to derive these two in the correct order.\n\nThe production S -> NT29 NT21 means that S produces two parts: NT29 and NT21. So, each part can be expanded into a string, and the final string is the concatenation of the two parts.\n\nSo, the first token 't91' must come from NT29, and 't63' from NT21.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking for NT29 that directly produces 't91' or through a series of steps.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- I see NT59 -> 't93' (from NT5 -> 't93', but that's a different NT)\nWait, I'm getting confused.

No, looking at NT65's rules: wait, no, under NT65, I don't see 't56' directly. Let me see:\n\nWait, under NT65, there's NT50 NT46, but looking at the NT50 and NT46 rules:\n\n- NT50 -> 't71' (from NT50 -> 't71')\n- So, if NT50 produces 't71' and NT46 produces something.\n\nWait, looking at all NTs:\n\nLooking for any rules that produce a single terminal:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT24 -> 't91' (No, wait, looking through the NT24 rules: I see that under NT24, 't91' is a possible terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-16","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t24 t91` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which expands into NT29 NT21. So S is a combination of two non-terminals. Each of these, NT29 and NT21, must eventually produce the required terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string `t24 t91`, it's two terminals separated by a space. So the derivation should produce these two in the correct order.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, I know that NT29 must derive `t24` and NT21 must derive `t91`, or vice versa. Wait, no, because in CFG, the order is determined by the expansion, so the first part of the string must come from NT29 and the second from NT21. So `t24` comes from NT29 and `t91` from NT21.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT29 and NT21.\n\nFor NT29, looking at the rules:\n\nNT29 -> NT0 NT58\nNT0 -> NT93\nNT58 -> NT20\nAnd from NT20's rules, there's NT20 -> NT2 NT55, and NT2 can produce NT5 NT60, NT5 -> NT72 NT64, etc. But I'm not sure if that's the right way. Alternatively, maybe there's a direct terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT29, does it directly produce a terminal? Let me check the rules. Yes, I see NT29's rules all expand into two non-terminals except perhaps none. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT29 that ends with a terminal. All rules for NT29 go to combinations like NT0 NT58, which are non-terminals. So maybe I'm wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals do lead directly to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT70 -> NT51 NT36, and also NT50->NT64 NT24. Wait, no, actually, NT50 produces NT64 NT24. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the NT29 and NT21 expansions more carefully.\n\nLooking at NT29's rules:\n\nNT29 -> NT0 NT58\n\nBut NT0->NT93, which is a terminal. Hmm, but how? NT93\u2192't93', right? So NT0 is 't93'. Wait, but NT29's first rule is NT0 NT58. So NT0 is 't93' and NT58 is something else. But where does NT58 go? Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT58, rule is NT58->NT52 NT28.\n\nWait, NT52 produces 't63', and NT28 is NT28\u2192NT37 NT72. NT37 is 't2', NT72 is NT72\u2192NT65 NT37, so that might loop back.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should see if there's a direct production for NT29 that leads to a terminal or a path that ends in t24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since the string is `t24 t91`, let me see where `t24` comes from.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't24' directly. So that's good. So if NT24 is one of the non-terminals that directly expands to 't24', then that part is easy.\n\nNow, looking at the initial rule for NT21: NT21->NT55 NT52. So let's break that down.\n\nNT55->NT10 NT34\nNT10-> NT5 NT19\nNT5-> NT93 which is 't93'\nNT34->'t48' via NT34->'t48' (from the terminal assignments)\nWait, but NT34 is a non-terminal that directly expands to 't48'. So in the path of NT55, if we go through NT10, which is 't93' (from NT5->'t93'), and NT34->'t48', so NT55 would be 't93 t48' if that's the path. Hmm, but we need 't91'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong path. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, NT21 is NT55 NT52. So NT55 can derive 't93 t48' as I just saw. NT52 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT52, rule is NT52->'t63' because NT52->'t63'. So combining these, NT55 NT52 would be 't93 t48 t63', which is three terminals, but our string is only two. So that's no good.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing a shorter path. Let me check the rules again. Maybe NT21 has a different production that can lead to 't91'.\n\nLooking at NT21's rules: NT21->NT55 NT52, and according to the production rules, I don't see any other options for NT21 besides this. So maybe I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps NT21 doesn't directly produce 't91', so maybe 't24' doesn't come from NT29 either. But wait, NT29 is supposed to produce the first part of the string.\n\nWait, let me check NT29 again. NT29->NT0 NT58. NT0 is 't93' (NT0->'t93'). NT58 is NT58->NT52 NT28. NT52 is 't63', and NT28->NT37 NT72. But NT37 is 't2' and NT72 is NT65 NT37. NT72->NT65 NT37, which would loop. Wait, perhaps NT24 has a direct expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the string is `t24 t91`. So we need two terminals. The grammar starts with S\u2192NT29 NT21, so each of these must produce one terminal, but NT29 and NT21 might produce more than one terminal each. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get 't24' from NT29 and 't91' from NT21.\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT24 can produce 't24' directly. So perhaps in NT21, there's a way to get 't91' directly, which I might have missed.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see 't91' as a terminal. The terminals are like 't24', 't50', 't2', etc. Wait, the string is `t24 t91`, which has 't91' as the second terminal. Is there a production for a non-terminal that would produce 't91'?\n\nLooking at the terminal assignments, I see NT51->'t87', NT33->'t23', etc. I don't see 't91' being assigned. So perhaps I'm wrong because 't91' isn't a terminal. Wait, but the string is given as `t24 t91`\u2014so maybe 't91' is not a terminal, which would mean the grammar can't produce it. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, I just realized that the grammar's terminal assignments include NT51->'t87', but 't91' isn't listed. So the string has 't91', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. That would mean the entire string can't be generated by the grammar because it can't produce a 't91'.\n\nWait, but that's a big point. Let me check the grammar's terminal rules again. I see:\n\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT19->'t15'\n- NT68->'t30'\n- NT19->'t33'\n- NT37->'t2'\n- NT24->'t24'\n- NT59->'t48'\n- NT28->'t20'\n- NT92 (wait, not present)\n- Other terminals: 't18', 't15', 't13', 't26', etc.\n\nBut I don't see 't91' being assigned to any non-terminal. So that would mean that the string can't be generated because it asks for a terminal that isn't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t13 t49 t33\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. That means each production is binary, so the parsing process should be straightforward, maybe something like using the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string breaks down into individual tokens: \"t13\", \"t49\", and \"t33\". Each of these is a terminal symbol. Now, I need to see how each of these can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting from S, the initial production is S -> NT29 NT21. So the parse tree will have S at the root, with two children NT29 and NT21. Each of those NTs must be expanded until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at NT29. In the grammar, there's a production NT29 -> NT0 NT58. Now, NT0 and NT58. NT0 has a production that eventually goes to 't93', but let me see: NT0 -> 't93'. So that's one path down for NT0. For NT58, let me check its productions. NT58 -> NT20 NT28. NT20 has a production to 't18', and NT28 has a production NT28 -> NT52 NT72.\n\nWait, but wait. Each step needs to reduce the symbols step by step. Maybe it's better to approach it by trying to parse the string.\n\nThe string is three tokens: t13, t49, t33. Since each production has two non-terminals, the first step would be to see if S can be broken down into two parts that each derive one token. But S is NT29 NT21. So the parse tree should have two branches: one from NT29 and one from NT21.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts. Hmm, but the string has three tokens. Wait, that's three terminals, but NT29 and NT21 each produce sequences of terminals. Maybe the way to process is that the string must come from NT29 producing the first two tokens, and NT21 producing the last one, but that doesn't make sense because NT29 and NT21 are both sequences themselves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of three tokens, which would need to come from three different productions, but each S only produces two. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, the entire string is \"t13 t49 t33\". So, three tokens in total. Since S \u2192 NT29 NT21, that's two non-terminals, so each must expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, but if NT29 produces \"t13 t49\" and NT21 produces \"t33\", that could work. So let's see if that's possible.\n\nFirst, looking at NT29. NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. Then NT0 \u2192 't93'? But in our string, the first token is t13, not t93. So that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT29 has another production that leads to t13.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, the productions for NT29 are only NT0 NT58. So that's the only way. So NT29 must produce t13, which would mean that t13 must come from NT29 and its descendants.\n\nWait, looking at NT29: it expands to NT0 NT58. So the first step is NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. Then, NT0 is simply 't93', so that would produce 't93', which doesn't match 't13'. So that's a problem. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built differently. Wait, perhaps the string is just three terminals and the grammar might have a way to merge them differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string must be the concatenation of NT29's expansion and NT21's expansion. So if NT29 expands to 't13 t49' and NT21 expands to 't33', that would fit.\n\nBut can NT29 produce 't13 t49'? Let's see. NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So the first step is to get from NT29 to NT0 and NT58. Now, each of those must expand into the proper tokens.\n\nNT0's only production is 't93'. So that can't lead to 't13'. Therefore, that path is invalid. Therefore, perhaps the string is not derived correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path for NT29. Wait, checking the grammar again, I don't see any other productions for NT29 besides NT0 NT58. So that's the only way.\n\nHmm, so if NT29 can't produce 't13', then the string 't13 t49 t33' can't be generated by this grammar, right? Because NT29's expansion starts with 't93', and that doesn't match 't13'.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any possibility of NT29 producing 't13' through another production. For example, is there any rule where NT29 leads directly to t13, or is it possible via another NT?\n\nNo, looking at the grammar, the only production for NT29 is NT0 NT58. So it can't produce anything else. Therefore, the initial assumption that S can expand into 't13 t49 t33' is wrong because S only gives two non-terminals, and the string has three terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is part of a larger context, but given that the problem states that the string is exactly \"t13 t49 t33\", I think that's not possible because S can only produce two parts, each of which must be a sequence of terminals, but here we have three in total. So that would mean the string is three tokens, which would require that each non-terminal generates a certain number of tokens, adding up to three.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this with parsing steps.\n\n1. The entire string is three tokens. Let's see if it can be parsed starting from S.\n\nAssume S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nThen, the string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLet's parse each part.\n\nFirst, NT29. It must produce the first part of the string. Since S starts S as NT29 followed by NT21, the first part (NT29) must expand into 't13 t49', and NT21 must expand into 't33'.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So we'd need NT0 to produce 't13' and NT58 to produce 't49' somehow. But NT0 only goes to 't93', so that doesn't work. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to get t13 from another NT. Let me check all NTs that can produce t13.\n\nLooking at the productions, the only NT with 't13' is NT19 \u2192 't15' and 't13's are at NT19 and others.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t33 t71 t15` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem and looking at the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided with several non-terminals producing other non-terminals or eventually terminals. Each rule appears to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which is consistent with Chomsky normal form. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t33 t71 t15`. Since the string has three tokens separated by spaces, it suggests that the derivation must start from the start symbol and produce exactly three symbols. Each symbol is a terminal, meaning they should be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I should check which non-terminals produce terminals. For example, some rules like `NT1 -> 't73'` directly produce a terminal, as do others like `NT21 -> 't18'`. But many other rules, like `S -> NT29 NT21`, are non-terminals that produce each other until they reach terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to see if each token in the string can be generated by a non-terminal, and if there exists a way to chain these productions to form the entire string.\n\nFirst, let's look at each token in the string: t33, t71, and t15.\n\nI need to find if there are derivation steps for each of these terminal symbols:\n\n1. t33: Looking at the rules, `NT33 -> 't23'`. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT33 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check. Oh, actually, looking at the grammar rules provided, I don't see NT33 as a non-terminal on the right-hand side. The rules have `NT33 -> 't23'`? No, wait, I think I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, there are rules that produce terminals. For example, `NT1 -> 't73'`, `NT21 -> 't18'`, `NT24 -> 't24'`, etc. But I need to check if t33 is generated by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see `NT15 -> NT71 NT68` and `NT71 -> 't90'`, `NT68 -> 't30'`. Hmm, but that leads to 't90' and 't30', which might not help. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, let me go through each token:\n\n- `t33`: Is there a non-terminal that produces 't33'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production. Wait, but maybe I missed it. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, the token 't33' is mentioned in `NT57 -> 't20'` no. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side ends with 't33'. Hmm, I see a rule `NT33 -> 't23'`, wait, no\u2014that's NT57. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\n- NT57 -> NT68 NT2\n- NT39 -> NT46 NT62\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- ...\n- There's a rule that says NT33 -> 't23'? Wait, I don't think so. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no, I think I got confused. The rule for NT33 is not directly producing 't23', but perhaps via other non-terminals. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, there's a rule like NT19 -> NT15 NT65. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me list all the rules where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nHere are the rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT59 -> 't0' 't58' \u2192 Wait, no, it's 't0' as the second part, but that's a string, but each rule is a production to the right-hand side, which can be two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each rule is two non-terminals. So, perhaps the way it's written, the right-hand side is a combination, and the terminals are present in the non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, each production is of the form NT_x -> NT_y NT_z, except for those that eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar rules are all in the form of two non-terminals except where they produce terminals. So perhaps the 'terminal' sequences come from the chains where you eventually reach a production that results in a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nEach token in the string must be a terminal, so each must be the result of a production sequence ending in that terminal.\n\nLet me start with `t33`. I need to find a non-terminal that can derive 't33'. Looking through the rules, I see `NT33 -> 't23'`. Wait, no\u2014looking at the rules, I see that there's a rule for NT57 -> 't20', and NT39 -> 't46' 't62', but where does 't33' come in?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> 't20' (Wait, no, that's 't20') \u2192 No, wait, in the grammar, there's a rule that says `NT57 -> 't20'`? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT57 -> 't20' \u2192 So, NT57 can produce 't20'. But that's `t20`, not `t33`.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up with the numbers. Let me list the rules again to find any that produce 't33' directly.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nI see that NT33 isn't a terminal; instead, I see rules for NT15 -> NT71 NT68, and NT71 -> 't90', NT68 -> 't30'. So, from NT15, you get 't90' and 't30' after two steps.\n\nWait, maybe the token 't33' is not present in any of the right-hand sides of the productions as a terminal, but perhaps 't33' is part of a non-terminal's production. Wait, perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps 't33' isn't a terminal but is itself a non-terminal. No, because in the string, the tokens are 't33', 't71', 't15', which are presumably terminals if they were derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, there's a rule `NT33 -> 't23'`, wait, no, that doesn't exist. Let me check each rule for any terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT59 -> 't0' 't58' \u2192 Not a terminal, since it's two terminals.\nWait, hold on, perhaps in the right-hand side, each production is a concatenation of two non-terminals. So, the only way to get a terminal is through multiple productions that eventually chain to a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, `NT29 -> 't48'` \u2192 Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it's written is that each production is of the form NT_x -> NT_y NT_z, which are themselves non-terminals, except when a rule directly connects to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps only some of the rules produce terminals. For example, looking through the rules again:\n\nWait, the rule NT71 -> 't90' is a terminal, as it is 't90'. Similarly, NT39 -> 't46' 't62'? Wait, no, each production is of the form NT_x -> NT_y NT_z, but some NT_y or NT_z may produce a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps the rule NT57 -> 't20' is a terminal. So, 't20' is a terminal symbol produced by NT57. Similarly, NT15 -> NT71 NT68: so NT71 can produce 't90', and NT68 can produce 't30'.\n\nLet me try to see for each token in the string:\n\n1. t33: Is there any production that can produce 't33'? Let's look for a rule where a non-terminal can produce 't33' either directly or via other productions.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The terminal symbols in the string are `t72`, `t2`, `t20`, `t71`.\n\nSo, starting from the string, each terminal must correspond to a production rule where the right-hand side contains exactly two terminals. Looking at the productions, any rule that is a terminal string can match a terminal in the string.\n\nBut since it's a derivation, the process is from S down to the string. So, I need to see if S can produce the string via a series of replacements.\n\nLooking at the string, it's four terminals: t72, t2, t20, t71.\n\nStep 1: Start with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, S -> NT29 NT21. Each of these NTs must derive into the respective parts of the string.\n\nThe string parts are t72, t2, t20, t71.\n\nBut each symbol in the string must come from the left-hand side of a production, which for a terminal will be something like NTx -> terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t72. Looking at the productions, NT72 -> NT65 NT37. But that leads to non-terminals. So, that's not helpful. Alternatively, is there a production for NT29 that leads to t72?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT29 -> t48? Wait, let's check.\n\nLooking for NT29 in the productions:\n\n- NT29 -> t48. Yes! So, NT29 can be rewritten as t48.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second part, NT21. We have NT21 -> nt55 NT52, but perhaps? Wait, in the productions, NT21 -> NT55 NT52, but that's non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the given productions, NT21's rule is:\n\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n\nBut that's two non-terminals, so we need to see what those can produce.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second part is t2.\n\nLooking at the productions, is there a NT2 rule? Yes, NT2 -> NT5 NT60, which is two non-terminals. But perhaps elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's break down the string into parts based on the S production.\n\nS -> NT29 NT21.\n\nThe string is \"t72 t2 t20 t71\".\n\nSo, NT29 must derive to \"t72 t2\", and NT21 must derive to \"t20 t71\"? Or perhaps I should think in terms of NT29 and NT21 needing to produce certain branches.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so perhaps S can produce two parts, each of which must generate the respective halves of the string.\n\nLet's think: the string is four tokens, so S (-> NT29 NT21) must generate the first two tokens and then the next two.\n\nSo, the first part, NT29, would produce \"t72\", and NT21 would produce \"t2 t20 t71\". Wait, but that doesn't make sense because NT21's production is two non-terminals. No, wait, no. The string is four tokens, so perhaps each non-terminal in S's production must produce two tokens.\n\nSo, S splits into NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29 -> t72?\n\nWait, looking at NT29's productions, I see:\n\n- NT29 -> t48. Oh, yes, one production is NT29 -> t48.\n\nSo, if the first non-terminal NT29 can produce t48, but that's only one token, and the string requires two tokens (t72 and t2). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing something up. The string is four tokens: t72, t2, t20, t71.\n\nBut S's production is NT29 NT21, meaning S can generate two parts, each of which needs to derive into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut the string has four terminals, so each of NT29 and NT21 must generate two terminals each.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is two non-terminals on the right. So, S -> NT29 NT21, which would each derive into sequences of terminals. But each NT29 must eventually derive into a sequence that adds up with NT21's sequence to the total string.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's four terminals. So, perhaps NT29 must produce \"t72 t2\" and NT21 must produce \"t20 t71\", but each of these is two terms, which would require each NT to split into two non-terminals, but their productions may not directly produce two terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to process the string from the end. Let's see if the string is a right-most derivation or left-most.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me write down the string: t72 t2 t20 t71.\n\nLet me think in reverse.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. That helps because I don't have to worry about more complex productions, which might complicate things.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. There are several non-terminals on the left side of the productions. The starting symbol is S, which expands into NT29 and NT21. So, I need to see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nLooking at the string: `t97 t16 t93 t97`. These are all terminals, so I need to trace back through the productions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe string has four tokens. Let's see how they can be generated.\n\n1. The first token is `t97`. Looking at the grammar, the production NT52 \u2192 't97' and NT21 \u2192 't55' but wait, NT21 is part of S's production, so maybe NT21 can't produce 't97'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT21 is not a production. Wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, where does NT21 expand? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55.\n\nSo, NT21 becomes NT55, but wait, then NT55 can expand further. Looking back, NT55 has productions:\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\n...\nBut in the string, the first token is t97, so maybe starting from NT52 or NT28?\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see which non-terminals can produce t97. Checking the rules:\n\nNT52 \u2192 't97' directly. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't93' (from NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 and other rules, but that's a chain). NT50 \u2192 't71', and so on.\n\nSo, t97 can appear as the direct expansion of NT52 or from other rules. Hmm, but in the string, the first token is t97, so either NT29 or NT21 must expand to t97. Wait, no. NT29 is part of S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, each expansion must produce t97, t16, t93, t97 in order.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree. Let me see:\n\nThe string has four tokens. Each production is two non-terminals on the right side, except perhaps when a non-terminal is a terminal. So, perhaps I can break the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nThe string is: t97, t16, t93, t97.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t97 and t16. What can produce these? Let's check which non-terminals can produce t97 and t16.\n\nt97 can come from NT52, because NT52 \u2192 't97' directly.\n\nt16 comes from NT41, because NT41 \u2192 't16'. Checking NT41's productions:\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36, or 't16'.\n\nSo, NT41 can either expand into 't16' or into NT2 (which is NT5) and NT36.\n\nLooking at NT36: NT36 \u2192 't20' or other rules, like NT36 \u2192 NT19 NT34, which can then produce 't15' and 't48', etc.\n\nWait, but the first two tokens are t97 and t16. So, perhaps the first part is t97 from NT52 and the second part is t16 from NT41.\n\nWait, but let me see if these can fit into a production. Maybe S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29, what can it produce? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT29 except in S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and in other rules like NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, etc. Wait, checking NT29:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see a production for NT29 except in S. So, that might not help. Maybe I should look elsewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the entire string can be generated through a series of steps. Let's try to see the steps.\n\nPossible starting point: S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, NT29 needs to expand into t97, and NT21 needs to expand into something that leads to t16.\n\nBut NT21 \u2192 NT55, so NT55 must produce a string that starts with t16, perhaps. Let's see.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\nSo, NT55 can expand into NT10 and NT34. Then, looking at NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19, and NT5 \u2192 't93' from NT5 \u2192 't93' or other rules. Wait, NT5 \u2192 't93' is a production: NT5 \u2192 't93' (from the rule NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but wait, that's part of another rule. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't93'. So, NT5 can directly produce t93.\n\nSo, if I have NT10, which is NT5 NT19, then NT5 produces t93, and NT19 \u2192 't15'. So, NT10 becomes 't93 t15'.\n\nThen NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34 would be 't93 t15' followed by what NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT34: The production NT34 \u2192 't60' or other options. But wait, let me confirm: NT34 can produce 't48' through one of its rules, as well as 't60', I think.\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34, and NT34 \u2192 't64' or NT24, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, under NT34, I see two rules:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\nNT34 \u2192 NT60\n\nWait, that's helpful. So, NT34 can produce 't60' directly, or it can expand further into NT64 and NT55.\n\nBut in our case, the third token in the string is 't93'. Let me see if that can fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is t97, t16, t93, t97. Let's try to split it into partial sequences.\n\nFirst, t97 can be generated by NT52 \u2192 't97'. So, let's see if the first non-terminal production starting S can use NT52.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, unless NT29 can produce 't97', that's not possible. Wait, but looking back, I don't see a direct production for NT29 except in S.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT29 having a production except in S's expansion. So, I can't get 't97' from NT29 directly. That suggests that the first t97 comes from NT29 not being a direct production, so that route might be closed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT29 again.\n\nWait, under NT26, there's a production NT26 \u2192 't13' and others. But looking for 't97', it's produced by NT52, which is a different non-terminal.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the string can't be generated because the first token is 't97', which is produced by NT52, but S expands into NT29 and NT21, which don't produce 't97'. So maybe the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe after expanding S, one of the branches produces t97, and the other produces something that can contribute to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So both NT29 and NT21 must expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo, suppose NT29 expands into a sequence that starts with t97, and NT21 expands into a sequence that leads to the remaining tokens.\n\nBut looking at NT29, the only production is in S, so NT29 must produce a string of tokens. But since S is at the root, and if NT29 can't produce t97, that's an issue.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT29 is only present in S's production, so unless there's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t15 t16 t60 t30 t35`. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let me see how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky normal form, so all productions are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That helps because each production is either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, the string we're checking consists of terminal symbols: t15, t16, t60, t30, t35. These must result from the grammar's terminals.\n\nI think the approach should be to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by tracing a possible left or right derivation. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's often easier to use a bottom-up approach, constructing the string from the bottom (terminals) up to the start symbol.\n\nLet me see the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals. For each 't' token, there's a production that replaces it. For instance, t15 is from NT71, t16 from NT41, etc. So each terminal corresponds to a particular non-terminal.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals, each mapped to a non-terminal. The plan is to break down the string into these non-terminals and see if their product can derive the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is t15 t16 t60 t30 t35.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- t15 \u2192 NT71\n- t16 \u2192 NT41\n- t60 \u2192 NT34\n- t30 \u2192 NT36 (since looking at NT36 \u2192 t30)\n- t35 \u2192 NT38\n\nWait, actually, let me check the grammar productions for terminals:\n\nFrom the list, I see:\n\n- NT71 \u2192 t21 (wait, no: looking back, the productions are given as, for example, NT71 \u2192 NT51 NT65.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t71 t49 t2 t30 t50` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and another non-terminal. Also, importantly, the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals. The grammar provided has a bunch of NT rules and some terminals, which must be parts of the language.\n\nLooking at the string: `t71 t49 t2 t30 t50`. So, it's split into five tokens. Each token is a terminal, right? Now, context-free grammars generate strings from the start symbol by replacing non-terminals with other symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me jot down the grammar rules. I see that several NT rules eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT1 -> NT21 NT24, which in the string corresponds to t55 and t60? Wait, no, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT1 has production rules like NT1 -> NT70 NT47, and then looking at the terminals, NT70 is t51, NT47 is t51. Hmm, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, I think the NT's terminals are listed later. For example, NT5 is 't93', NT34 is 't60', and so on. So I need to see if the string can be built starting from S.\n\nThe string has five terminals. Let me count the number of tokens: 5. Hmm, context-free grammars can generate any length depending on the rules, but it's about the structure.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21. So the first step is S becomes NT29 NT21. Each of these is a non-terminal, so I need to see where NT29 and NT21 lead.\n\nLooking at NT29: in the rules, I see it's in the production. Wait, no, it's a terminal? No, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT29 being a production. Wait, let me check. Wait, in the grammar, it's written as NT59 -> NT0 NT58, etc. Hmmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps I need to look for the terminals in the list.\n\nAt the end of the grammar, I see that NT5 is 't93', NT34 is 't60', and so on. So the terminals are scattered across these rules. So for the string `t71 t49 t2 t30 t50`, each token corresponds to a specific rule.\n\nLet me map each token to a terminal:\n\nt71: Looking at the rules, I see NT71 -> NT10 NT65. Hmm, but NT10 is 't5', not 't71'. Wait, no, looking again, the terminals are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19. But as a terminal? Wait, no, the terminals are listed as NT33 -> 't23', etc., and a few others.\n\nWait, no, sorry, the terminals are the specific token strings like 't71', 't49', etc. Each terminal is a single token, so I need to find which non-terminal rules end up producing each of these.\n\nLet me make a list of the terminals:\n\nt71, t49, t2, t30, t50.\n\nNow, for each of these, find which NT rule produces them.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't73' \u2192 So NT1 -> NT73. But wait, 't73' is a terminal, so how does that work? Or perhaps NT1 produces 't73' as a terminal.\n\nWait, no. NT1's production rules are like NT1 -> NT70 NT47, but that's for non-terminals. However, somewhere in the rules, some NT's are terminals. For example, I see NT10 -> NT5 NT19, but that's a production. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse each terminal token and see which NT rule they come from.\n\nLet me go through each token:\n\n1. t71: Looking through the rules, I see NT71 -> NT10 NT65, but as terminals, does any NT produce t71? I don't see a direct production that produces 't71' as a terminal, except perhaps via some rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Wait, the user listed the rules as NT1 -> NT70 NT47, etc. Then, in another section, they listed some NT as terminals:\n\nLike NT25 -> ..., and towards the end, some lines have 't50', 't97', which I think are the terminal strings.\n\nWait, let me check again. At the bottom, after NT65 -> 't56', I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't93', NT34 -> 't48', NT0 -> 't93', etc. Okay, so some NT's directly produce terminal strings.\n\nSo, for example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58; but NT0 is 't93', and NT58 is 't20' (I think). Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see NT58 is 't20'? Or is it?\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, let me list all the NT's and their terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n\n- NT20 -> 't18' (Wait, but NT20 in the rules is a production: NT20 -> NT2 NT55. So I'm getting confused.)\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up NTs that produce terminals with those that are just intermediate steps. So perhaps some NTs are terminals and others are not. So for example, in the provided rules, the last lines have 't97', etc., which are terminals.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, I need to find an NT rule that produces exactly that terminal.\n\nLet me map each token to its NT:\n\n- t71: Looking through the rules, I see NT50 -> 't71' (from NT50 -> 't71' as per the bottom rules). Yes, NT50 produces 't71'.\n\n- t49: Looking at the rules, I see NT49 -> 't49'? Wait, looking, I don't see that. Wait, NT51 -> 't87', NT39 -> 't80', NT60 -> 't49', so NT60 produces 't49'.\n\n- t2: NT2 -> 't5'? No, looking, NT2 is a production, but looking at the rules, I see NT72 -> 't65', etc. Wait, perhaps NT34 -> 't60'? Wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should list all the terminal NTs:\n\nFrom the rules section:\n\n- NT46 -> 't35'\n\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n\n- NT55 -> 't10'\n\nWait, let me go through the bottom lines:\n\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n\n- NT34 -> 't48'\n\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n\n- NT20 -> 't18'\n\n- NT20 -> 't72'\n\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n\n- NT24 -> 't91'\n\n- NT47 -> 't51'\n\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n\n- NT71 -> 't90'\n\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n\n- NT68 -> 't30'\n\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n\n- NT36 -> 't20'\n\nWait, so let's list each terminal and its NT:\n\nt71 \u2192 NT50\n\nt49 \u2192 NT60 (since NT60 is 't49')\n\nt2 \u2192 Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't2'. Hmm, wait, let me check. NT34 ends up as 't60', but maybe another NT produces 't2'.\n\nWait, in NT rules, I see NT65 -> 't56' and NT72 -> 't65'. But wait, that's not helpful.

{"custom_id":"request-65","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string `t51 t91 t24 t91 t24 t11` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit easier since each production has two non-terminals on the right side. \n\nFirst, let me recall the structure of Chomsky Normal Form: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is important because it simplifies the parsing process, and I can use algorithms like the CYK algorithm to check for membership.\n\nBut wait, the CYK algorithm is typically used for top-down parsing or as a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars. Alternatively, since the grammar is given, maybe I can try to parse the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals as needed.\n\nLet me start by listing all the productions and see which ones lead to terminals, as that will help in breaking down the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several productions that directly result in terminals. For example:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't97'\n- NT13 \u2192 't50'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13' (since it's in two places)\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT71 \u2192 't56'\n- NT5 \u2192 't93'\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n- NT20 -> 't18' and 't72'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT47 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't73', 't90', etc.\n- NT19 -> 't15', 't33', 't68'\n\nWait, the string we have is `t51 t91 t24 t91 t24 t11`. Let me break it down into tokens: t51, t91, t24, t91, t24, t11.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that t51 is a terminal. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce t51? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT47 \u2192 t51, so that's the only one. So, t51 must come from NT47. So, the first symbol in the string t51 must come from the production NT47 \u2192 t51. So, the first symbol is the end of NT47. \n\nBut wait, looking at the entire production for S, it's S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S produces two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. So, the entire string must be a sequence of symbols generated by expanding these two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of six tokens. So S must expand into a sequence that produces six tokens when fully expanded. Let's see.\n\nThe S production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the string must be a combination of tokens generated by NT29 and NT21. Each of these non-terminals can produce sequences of tokens, so let's see.\n\nLet me look at NT29. From the productions:\n\nNT29 is in two places:\n\n- NT29 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT29 -> NT24 NT55\n\nSo, NT29 can produce either NT0 NT58 or NT24 NT55.\n\nSimilarly, NT21:\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see NT21 directly, but in the given grammar, there's:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n- NT29 \u2192 t48\n- NT21 is in two places:\n  - NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n  So, NT21 can be NT55 NT52 or, probably, I should check all productions:\n\nWait, looking again, the productions for NT21:\n\n- The grammar has two NT21 productions:\n  1. NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n  2. NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT62\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So NT21 can produce either NT55 NT52 or NT20 NT62.\n\nWait, I need to confirm. Let me list all NT21 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT21, the productions are:\n\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- NT21 -> NT20 NT62\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the string's tokens are generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nThe string is t51 t91 t24 t91 t24 t11.\n\nSo, the structure would be [tokens generated by NT29] [tokens generated by NT21].\n\nNow, let's examine each part.\n\nFirst, the NT29 part: the first token is t51. Let's look at the productions for NT29.\n\nNT29 can be NT0 NT58 or NT24 NT55.\n\nSo, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nThen, the string starts with t51, which comes from NT47 \u2192 t51.\n\nBut wait, NT29 is part of S, which is at the top level. So, the first part of the string t51 must come from the expansion of NT29. So, if NT29 is t51, but that's not possible because NT29's expansions don't produce terminals directly; they produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking back, NT29 can be either NT0 NT58 or NT24 NT55. So, each of those includes non-terminals, so the t51 must come from somewhere deeper. Wait, but the first token is t51, which comes from NT47. How does that fit into the NT29 expansion?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: the entire string is generated by S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S expands into the concatenation of NT29 and NT21's expansions.\n\nSo, the sequence of tokens is:\n\n[ tokens from NT29 ] followed by [ tokens from NT21 ]\n\nSo, the string has six symbols, so maybe each part expands into 3 symbols each, but perhaps not. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t51, which must come from NT29's production. So, which production in NT29 can generate a terminal in the first step? But looking at the NT29 productions, both are to non-terminals, so NT29 itself does not directly produce a terminal. So, t51 must be the result of further expansion within the NT29's production.\n\nSo, for example, if NT29 is split as NT0 NT58, then each of those non-terminals must produce sequences that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nBut the first symbol is t51, which is produced by NT47 \u2192 t51. So, perhaps one of the non-terminals in the NT29 or NT21 productions leads to NT47.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if the entire string can be broken down by tracing the steps.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, each part contributes a part to the string. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT29, which should result in some number of tokens, and the second part is NT21's expansion, resulting in the remaining tokens.\n\nThe string has six tokens: t51 t91 t24 t91 t24 t11.\n\nPerhaps NT29 expands into three tokens, and NT21 into three tokens.\n\nLet's see:\n\nIf NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\n\nSo the first symbol is t93. But in the string, it's t51, so this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, NT29 \u2192 NT24 NT55.\n\nSo, NT24 and NT55.\n\nNow, NT24 can produce either 't24' as a terminal or more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT24's productions:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24', which is a terminal. Also, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57.\n\nWait, the string's first token is t51, which is from NT47, so how does that fit?\n\nWait, maybe I'm not thinking correctly. Let me try again.\n\nThe first symbol is t51, which is produced by NT47 \u2192 t51. So, in the overall expansion, somewhere in the NT29 or NT21 production, we must have a branch that leads to NT47.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as a full parsing process.\n\nLet me think about the whole string and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Also, some productions have terminals on the right, like NT52 \u2192 't97', so that's fine as well.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t2 t87 t63 t63 t73 t48`. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar. The strategy I'll use is to parse the string from the beginning, trying to find a path through the grammar that can produce it.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals and terminals present in the grammar and the string. The non-terminals include S, NT29, NT21, NT47, NT26, NT20, NT59, NT65, NT46, NT38, NT34, NT64, NT2, NT59, etc. The string has terminals t2, t87, t63, t63, t73, t48. So I need to find if these terminals can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t2. So I need to find a production rule that starts with a non-terminal that can derive t2. Let's see, in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, which eventually might lead to a terminal. But t2 is a terminal. Looking at the non-terminals, I think NT2 produces t2. Wait, checking the grammar: NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60. So to get t2 from NT2, I'd need NT5 \u2192 t2, which is correct. So NT2 can derive t2.\n\nSo the first part is NT2 \u2192 t2. That's good. Then the next symbol is t87, which is derived from NT59 \u2192 t87? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58. Hmm, but I don't see a direct way to get t87 from NT59. Wait, perhaps there's a rule elsewhere. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26. Then NT10 produces t93, and NT26 can produce t13. But t87 is a terminal. Is there any rule for NT87? Wait, no, because the grammar only has non-terminals defined for NT2, NT5, etc., so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let me start by attempting to parse the string.\n\nThe string is: t2 t87 t63 t63 t73 t48.\n\nLet's try to break it down into parts. Since S is the start symbol, S should derive the entire string. So first, S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 and NT21: Let's see what they can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT21 appears in a few places. For example, NT52 \u2192 't97', NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, and elsewhere NT21 might produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Then NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34. NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19. NT5 \u2192 't93', and NT19 \u2192 't15'. So that path would give t93 t15. But maybe NT21 has another production, like NT21 \u2192 't72' according to the given grammar: Wait no, checking the grammar, I see NT21 \u2192 't72'. Is that correct? Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nLooking at the end part, I see NT21 is defined as NT55 NT52 and also as 't72' if I check the last few rules:\n\nYes, looking at the end:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't72' and other rules. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list all productions for NT21. From the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't72'\n\nAlso, NT21 might be part of several productions. Wait, let me look through all the rules to find where NT21 appears. It seems that in the grammar provided, NT21 is defined in a few places.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me parse through each line:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\n- I see NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38 again?\nWait, no, the grammar has several NT26 rules but mostly duplicates. No, let me go line by line.\n\nLooking through the lines, here's where NT21 appears:\n\n- Line 81: NT21 \u2192 't72'\n- Line 78: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\nWait, no, line 78 is NT20. Line 81 is NT21 \u2192 't72'\n\nSo NT21 has two productions: one that's direct, NT21 \u2192 't72', and another that is part of another rule: NT20 \u2192 NT21 NT55.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list all possible productions for each non-terminal.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step, making a parse tree as I go.\n\nThe string is: t2 t87 t63 t63 t73 t48.\n\nI'll try to match this string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the first part is NT29 and second is NT21, and each should produce a part of the string. Let's see if t2 can be produced from the first non-terminal, NT29, and t87 from NT21.\n\nWait, no, because S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the entire string must be a concatenation of NT29's derivation and NT21's derivation. So if the string is of length 6, each non-terminal should produce a substring whose total length adds up to 6.\n\nWait, but in this case, I think each non-terminal will produce a certain number of symbols. So perhaps NT29 should produce the first part and NT21 the second part.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t2, so NT29 should derive t2 followed by more symbols. Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should instead think in terms of the entire string and trying to find a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more methodically, let's try to factor the string into a sequence of symbols each corresponding to a production rule.\n\nAnother approach is to try to match the entire string starting from S and working down.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, after S is derived, we have 't2 t87 t63 t63 t73 t48' as the result of NT29 producing something and NT21 producing something else concatenated together.\n\nSo maybe NT29 produces t2 followed by something, and NT21 produces the rest.\n\nBut let's see: t2 is from NT29, so NT29 \u2192 t2 followed by some other symbols.\n\nLooking at NT29: The grammar has NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT15. So NT29 can produce NT47 and NT15 as a concatenation.\n\nFrom NT47, looking at the productions: NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT65. Then NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT65 \u2192 NT56. So far, this path is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT29 has another production. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any direct production for NT29 except NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT15. So yes, that's the only option for NT29.\n\nSo if NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT15, and then NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT65, then combining, we have NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT15 \u2192 (NT59 NT65) NT15 \u2192 NT59 NT65 NT15.\n\nContinuing, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which is \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nBut this seems to be going deeper and deeper without hitting any terminals. So this path might not be the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to explore another approach. Let me see if I can find"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-76","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t51 t2 t80 t30 t90 t35 t48`, and the grammar consists of several production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where A is a terminal. This grammar seems to have most right-hand sides as two non-terminals, except for a few where a terminal is directly present.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that some rules have terminal symbols. For example, `NT52 -> 't97'` or `NT13 -> 't50'`. This indicates that the grammar actually contains terminal strings, but since it's in CNF, each production can have at most two non-terminals on the right side. \n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so each of these must be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces the string from the root by two symbols, so the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of productions used. Here, the string has 7 tokens, which is 2^2 + 3, which isn't a power of two. That might be a problem because the derivation process would require the number of symbols to be a power of two.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the length of the generated string is the number of terminals produced. Each production in CNF either produces one terminal or two non-terminals. The entire string is a series of terminals derived from the initial symbol S, through a series of productions that may split into two non-terminals at each step. So the string length may not necessarily be a power of two, but it might have a derivation that requires splitting in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production that introduces a terminal short-circuits the splitting. For example, if a production directly outputs a terminal, then the number of non-terminals at each step can be reduced. But I'm not sure if that logic holds. I might need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to trace the string through the grammar, seeing if each terminal matches a production and can be produced correctly.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string: `t51 t2 t80 t30 t90 t35 t48`. That's seven terms, so the total number of symbols in the final string is 7. \n\nIn CNF, the start symbol S would expand into two non-terminals. Each of those could expand further, each into two non-terminals, except when a terminal is produced. So the derivation of the string would be a leftmost derivation where each step either splits into two non-terminals or terminates with a terminal.\n\nSince the string starts with `t51`, let's see which production rule for a non-terminal can produce `t51`. Looking at the rules, I see that `NT52 -> 't97'` is one, but perhaps looking for `t51`. Wait, searching through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT<something> that has a production ending with 't51'. I don't see any directly, but maybe through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal directly produces `t51`. Looking through the rules:\n\nSearching for 't51' in the right-hand sides. I see `NT52 -> 't97'` and `NT19 -> 't15'`, `NT71 -> 't90'`, `NT68 -> 't30'`, `NT36 -> 't20'`, and `NT50 -> 't71'`, `NT70 -> 't51'`. Oh, here it is: `NT70 -> 't51'`. So the first terminal in the string is `t51`, which is directly produced by NT70. So in the derivation, after S expands, one of the two non-terminals must result in t51 directly. \n\nSo the initial step would be S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Let's assume that S expands into NT29 and NT21. Then, each of these two non-terminals will be expanded until they produce terminals. One of them will eventually produce t51, and the other will produce something else.\n\nBut for the string to be valid, the entire string must be generated correctly in order. Let me think about that. So, the tree would have to branch out in a way that the first symbol t51 comes from one path, and the rest of the string comes from the other path.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the entire string as a sequence of terms and see if each can be produced by the grammar. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production can only produce up to two non-terminals, and the string is a series of terminals, so we need to see if each terminal can be generated through a sequence of binary splits, ending appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each terminal is generated from a non-terminal, which may have been split or went directly.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can approach this by building a parse tree from the right, using the grammar's productions to match the string.\n\nWait, another idea is to note that in CNF, the initial symbol S would generate a string by expanding into two non-terminals. Each non-terminal would then generate either one terminal or two non-terminals. The total length would be 2^n. Here, the string has 7 terms, which is 7 = 2^3 -1, so that's not a power of two. However, that might not be an issue because the grammar can have some productions that terminate early, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list the string: `t51 t2 t80 t30 t90 t35 t48`. Each is a terminal. So for each terminal, I need to see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLet's go one by one:\n\n1. t51: produced by NT70 \u2192 't51'.\n\n2. t2: produced by NT25 \u2192 't2' wait, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for t2:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I found `NT59 -> NT0 NT58`, `NT60 -> 't49'`, `NT47 -> 't51'`, but for t2, maybe it's in a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should search through all the rules. Let me scan through the given grammar:\n\nLooking for right-hand sides with the terminals. So:\n\n- `NT52 -> 't97'`\n- `NT13 -> 't50'`\n- `NT37 -> 't2'`\n- `NT34 -> 't60'`\n- `NT51 -> 't87'`\n- `NT39 -> 't80'`\n- `NT60 -> 't49'`\n- `NT41 -> 't16'`\n- `NT26 -> 't13'` Wait, that's a non-terminal expanding to a terminal, but in CNF, that's allowed as long as each production has at most two non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, I can see which production can produce it. Let's list each terminal and the corresponding non-terminal:\n\n- t51 \u2192 NT70 (as per the rule NT70 -> 't51')\n- t2 \u2192 NT37 (rule NT37 -> 't2')\n- t80 \u2192 NT39 (rule NT39 -> 't80')\n- t30 \u2192 NT68 (rule NT68 -> 't30')\n- t90 \u2192 NT71 (rule NT71 -> 't90')\n- t35 \u2192 NT58 (rule NT58 -> 't35')\n- t48 \u2192 NT24 (rule for NT24: `NT24 -> 't48'`?)\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT24: Yes, I see `NT52 -> 't97'` and others, but wait, looking for NT24: \n\nWait, the rules include:\n\n- `NT24 -> 't24'` \u2192 So NT24 produces 't24', which is different from 't48'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some NT24 rules. Let me check:\n\nYes, in the given grammar, there's `NT24 -> 't24'`. So to produce 't48', I'm looking for a non-terminal that expands to 't48'.

Let me try to walk through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or two terminal symbols. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF since all rules have two elements on the RHS, either two non-terminals or a mix until we reach terminals, which are those starting with 't'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t73 t91 t49 t30 t87 t91 t72`. I notice that each 't' followed by a number seems to represent a terminal symbol, so the overall structure is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into these components. Let's parse the string into individual tokens: t73, t91, t49, t30, t87, t91, t72.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT21. So the first two parts are NT29 and NT21. Looking at the grammar rules, NT29 has a production: NT29 -> NT0 NT58, and NT58 can sometimes be a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT29:\n\n- NT29 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT8\n  - NT5 -> NT72 NT64\n  - NT64 -> NT59 NT37\n    - NT59 -> ...\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe I should look for a way to rewrite NT29 into terminals. Wait, maybe I should also check the string's tokens to see if they match any of the terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the first token, t73. Checking the grammar for NT73: Looking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT5 -> 't93' (from NT5 -> NT34 -> ... etc. Wait, no, looking through, I don't see an NT73 rule. Wait, let me scan through the entire grammar for any NT that directly produces 't73'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule NT71 -> 't90', so no. The only 't73' I see is under NT5 -> 't93'\u2014wait, but I'm looking for NT73. Maybe it's not present. Wait, perhaps the tokens are using another system, but looking through, I don't see any NTX rule that directly produces 't73'. Hmm, that might suggest that the string cannot be generated, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t73, but looking through the grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't73'? Checking all the rules that produce terminals, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> 't97' (from NT17 -> NT71 NT68)\n- NT9 -> 't80' (but not here)\nWait, no, NT1 in the grammar is produced by NT1 -> NT70 NT47, and further breaks down. Let me see:\n\nLooking at each production that leads to a terminal (tX):\n\n- NT5 -> 't93' (from NT5 -> NT34 -> 't48'? No, I think not. Wait, looking back, the grammar rules that produce terminals are:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS is two terminals, or a non-terminal on one side and a terminal on the other. For example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58, but NT0 and NT58 can further break down until we get terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT21. The string starts with t73. So the first two parts should be t73 and something else. But looking at the S production, it's NT29 NT21. So the first part is NT29 and the second is NT21.\n\nFor NT21, in the grammar, NT21 is a terminal 't18'. So the second part is t18. But the string starts with t73, not t18. That suggests that maybe S cannot produce t73 t91... because the first part is NT29, which starts with T73 (from NT73?), but in the grammar, there's no rule that produces 't73' directly.\n\nWait, wait, let me check the rules again. Wait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't73'. Only NT5 -> 't93', which is different. So, that suggests that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol, t73, is not present in any production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The string is `t73 t91 t49 t30 t87 t91 t72`, so seven tokens. The grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21. NT21 is a terminal t18.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it seems to have several non-terminals (like S, NT29, NT47, etc.) and terminals (like t71, t13, etc.). Each production rule is of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, except for the ones that produce terminals. For example, NT52 -> 't97', which is a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of terminal symbols. So, to see if this string is generated by the grammar, I can trace the possible derivation path from the start symbol S to this string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S -> NT29 NT21. So, the first two tokens should come from NT29 and NT21. Let me check the string: the first is t71, which would come from NT29, since looking at NT29's productions, NT29 -> 't71' in the given rules. The next token is t13, which should come from NT21. Looking at NT21: in the rules, NT21 -> 't18' and another production isn't given. Wait, the rule for NT21 is NT21 -> NT55 NT52. Oh, right, I think I missed that initially. So NT21 splits into NT55 and NT52. So for NT21, the next token is t13. Looking at the production of NT52: NT52 -> 't97'. Hmm, no, the token is t13. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I misread the rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT52: NT52 -> 't97'. But in the string, the token is t13. So that doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT52: yes, it's a terminal 't97', so it can't produce t13. So perhaps the derivation path isn't possible. But wait, maybe the string starts with t71, which is from NT29, and then t13 from NT21. But NT21 can't produce t13 directly because it only has productions that either lead to terminals or other non-terminals. Specifically, NT21's production is NT55 NT52. But NT55 is a non-terminal that might produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look deeper. Let me see the rules for NT55. Looking at the grammar, NT55 -> NT10 NT34, and NT10 -> NT5 NT19, etc. NT34 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT34 can produce. From the rules: NT34 -> NT64 NT55, which is another chain. Wait, this seems recursive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to find a path that can generate each token in the string step by step. Let me try to reconstruct the derivation.\n\nThe string is: t71, t13, t80, t49, t91, t35, t16, t87.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols must be the results of NT29 and NT21 derivations. NT29, according to the rules, can only produce 't71' as a terminal. So that matches the first token, t71.\n\nNow, the second token must come from NT21. Looking at NT21's rules: NT21 can only produce NT55 NT52. So both NT55 and NT52 are non-terminals that eventually must produce 't13' as the second token. But wait, both NT55 and NT52 are non-terminals; how can they produce a terminal directly?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't97' (terminal)\n- NT55's rules: NT55 -> NT10 NT34\n\nSo, NT55 can't directly produce 't13' unless one of its productions does that. Looking through the rules, let's see if any non-terminal directly produces 't13'. Looking at the list: NT15 -> 't2' and 't50' is 't50', but I don't recall any rule that directly produces 't13'. Wait, looking again: in the rules, NT19 -> 't15', which is another token. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check each production rule where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, which is called a terminal production. These are straightforward.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't97' (produces t97)\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT29 -> 't71'\n- NT59 -> 't0 (t93?)

No, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write down all the terminal productions to see which non-terminals directly produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminal productions (those that go straight to 't's) are:\n\n- NT59 -> 't0' ? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, let me list the rules where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT58 -> 't52' or 't20' (no, looking back, no: NT58 -> 't52'?)

Okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form has each production rule on the left side generating two symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S, and the string is all terminals, so I'm looking to see if I can derive this string starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S directly produces NT29 NT21. So, the first step is to see if I can match 't91' and 't50' to NT29 and NT21 respectively. Let's check the productions for NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, from the list, I don't see an NT29. Hmm, perhaps I misread. Let me double-check. Oh, NT29 is in the productions for NT59: NT59 -> NT0 NT58. And NT0 is 't93', which I don't see in the string. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, looking again. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The string starts with 't91', so perhaps we need to find which NT ends with 't91'.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, I see that NT59 -> NT1 NT13, and NT13 is 't50' as per the given productions. Also, NT59 -> others like NT29 NT34. Wait, NT59's production for 't91' isn't directly there. Oh, but wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 has a production NT24 -> 't24', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT29 is in the production of NT59: NT59 -> NT29 NT34. Wait, but I don't have a production for NT29 as a terminal, but according to the given grammar, I think NT52 is the only one that produces 't63' because NT24 is 't24' and others seem to produce other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's map out the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t91 t50 t63 t63 t73 t87 t35 t20.\n\nEach production in the grammar splits into two symbols, so the derivation starts with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, t91 must come from NT29, and t50 from NT21. Let's check the productions for NT29: NT29 is in NT59's production: NT59 -> NT29 NT34. NT29 is also in NT59's other productions. Wait, in the given grammar, NT29 is part of NT59's production, so NT59 -> NT29 NT34, and NT29 isn't listed as a terminal, but is it listed elsewhere? Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT29 being a terminal, but I do see NT24 and NT29 in the productions as parts of other rules. Wait, no, wait: looking again, for NT29, perhaps it's a non-terminal. So NT29 must be expanded further. So NT29 is part of NT59's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting somewhere. Let me try to follow a possible derivation path.\n\nStart: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo 't91' must come from NT29. Let's see what NT29 expands to. Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT29 as a terminal, so it must be a non-terminal that produces two symbols. Wait, looking through the rules, is there any NT29 on the left? Let me check. I see NT29 in the production for NT59: NT59 -> NT29 NT34. So NT29 isn't a terminal itself. That means that 't91' can't be directly from NT29 unless NT29 produces 't91' somehow. Wait, perhaps I missed a rule for NT29. Let me check the grammar again: Oh wait, in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT29 except within NT59. So perhaps 't91' can't come directly from NT29, which is part of NT59. That would mean that NT29 must expand into something that eventually resolves to 't91'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again to make sure I didn't misread any production rules. Wait, NT29 is in NT59's production, but there's no production for NT29 on the left by itself. So 't91' must come from some expansion of a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't91'. So unless there's a production for a non-terminal that directly produces 't91', the string can't be derived. Looking through the grammar, do I see any NT that directly produces 't91'? Hmm, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT -> 't91' as a production. Oh, wait, I think I see a rule: NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 is 't93'. Wait, but in another rule, NT24 -> 't24', which is a terminal. Also, NT59 -> NT59 NT34, which is another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if 't91' can be derived from a particular rule. Let me go through each production and see if any left-hand side is 't91'. It doesn't seem so. The only production that leads to a terminal is NT24, NT26, NT38, etc., but none of them directly produce 't91'. Wait, actually, looking at the given rules, I think I see that NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 is 't93' which is a terminal. But 't93' isn't in the string. Wait, the string is `t91 t50 t63 t63 t73 t87 t35 t20`\u2014no 't93' there. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me see if there's any NT that can produce 't91'. Looking through the rules, I see NT24 -> 't24', NT26 -> 't29' (from NT24->NT47... etc.), but 't24' is t24. Hmm. Wait, looking through the list of terminals, I see 't91', 't50', etc. But in the grammar, is there any rule that directly produces 't91'? Let me scan through the production rules. No, I don't see any left-hand side that results in 't91' as a terminal. So unless there's an NT that can produce 't91' through a chain of productions, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh, the production for NT59: NT59 can produce NT0 NT58, but NT0 is 't93', which isn't in the string. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, NT59 can also produce NT59 NT34, but that's recursive. Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: let's consider the string as a sequence of pairs, since each step in the derivation splits into two symbols. So the string has eight tokens, which would require seven splits. Wait, but each production step replaces one symbol with two, so for a string with n symbols, you need n-1 productions starting from S, which has two symbols in its first step.\n\nBut let's try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t91, t50, t63, t63, t73, t87, t35, t20.\n\nSo it's split into pairs: (t91, t50)(t63, t63)(t73, t87)(t35, t20). Wait, but in a leftmost derivation, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but since S is the start symbol, and its first production is NT29 NT21, we have to split t91 and t50 into NT29 and NT21.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that NT29 isn't a terminal, so how do we get 't91' from NT29? Because, if NT29 is a non-terminal, it can only generate other symbols, so unless it can directly produce 't91', which it doesn't, this would be impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me see: the first symbol is 't91', which must come from NT29.

So each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating starts and ends with non-terminals, specifically S, which is the start symbol. The string given is `t2 t97 t2 t63 t63 t56 t90 t97 t51`, and each token is separated by spaces. So the entire string is a sequence of terminals, no non-terminals, which makes me think about how the parsing tree would look.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols (either non-terminals or one terminal). Thus, the number of symbols in the string should relate to the number of productions. Wait, the string has 9 symbols, which correspond to the nodes in the parse tree.\n\nFor example, if the starting symbol is S, each step doubles the number of nodes. But since we're starting from a single S, the number of leaves (terminals) in the parse tree would be 2^n where n is the number of productions. But here, the actual string length is 9 terminals. Let's think in terms of the derivation process.\n\nStarting with S, the first step would be S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So after one step, we have two non-terminals. Each subsequent step would replace each non-terminal with its productions, expanding the string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to look at the mapping from these non-terminals to terminals. The string given is exactly the sequence of terminals that result from substituting all the non-terminals in the parse tree. So each non-terminal in the grammar will lead to a specific terminal string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like NT2, NT5, etc.) eventually resolves to a specific terminal (like 't2', 't18', etc.) or further non-terminals. So if I can follow the derivation of the string, it should exactly match the productions.\n\nLet me map the string to see if each terminal corresponds correctly. The string is: t2 t97 t2 t63 t63 t56 t90 t97 t51.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so after the first step, we have NT29 and NT21.\n\nLet's consider the leftmost non-terminal, NT29. Looking at the grammar, NT29 has a production NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58. Wait, no, NT29 doesn't have a production. Wait, maybe I need to check each non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: I might have to map each NT symbol to its production rules. Let me try to see how each terminal in the string is generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to a right- or leftmost derivation. If it's the leftmost, then we start from S \u2192 NT29 NT21, then each step replaces the first non-terminal.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to assign the string as a result of the rightmost derivation. Let me see.\n\nEach step in the derivation can produce two symbols. The string has 9 symbols, so the parse tree must have a height of 4, because 2^4 = 16 leaves, but that's not matching. Alternatively, the number of symbols should be 2^h, but we have 9, which is not a power of 2. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach because not all symbols after each step are non-terminals. Wait, in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols. So for each non-terminal, each replacement produces two symbols. Thus, starting with 1 non-terminal, after 1 step: 2. After 2 steps: 4. After 3 steps: 8. After 4 steps: 16. But the string has 9 symbols, which is not 2^4=16 or 2^3=8. So it doesn't fit. This suggests that it's impossible because in CNF, the number of symbols (terminals) after k steps is 2^k, so 8 is after 3 steps, but the string has 9.\n\nBut wait, maybe the string is a concatenation of more than one path in the grammar, but that's not possible as the grammar defines a single string.\n\nWait, but the total number of terminals in the string is 9, which is not a power of two plus one or something, but perhaps this approach is incorrect. Maybe I should instead look at the mappings of each non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, each non-terminal NT has a set of production rules that can be traced back to terminals. So perhaps each non-terminal expands into a specific sequence of terminals.\n\nFor example, NT1 has a production rule that directly goes to 't73', which is a terminal. So NT1 \u2192 't73'. So 't73' in the string could be a direct match.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 \u2192 't18'. NT5 \u2192 't93', NT70 \u2192 't51', etc.\n\nLooking at the string t2 t97 t2 t63 t63 t56 t90 t97 t51, I can try to trace back each terminal through the grammar to see if it can be generated.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t2, which in the grammar is the result of NT1 \u2192 't73', but in the string, the first t2 is in position 0. So perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the terminal symbols in reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps each step introduces two terminals, so the total number must be 2^n.\n\nBut in the string, there are 9 terminals, which is not 2^n, so it's impossible. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the length doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in CNF, each production increases the number of symbols (terminals) by exactly 1 (since two symbols are added: either two non-terminals or one terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, each production replaces one non-terminal with two symbols. So starting from one non-terminal, after first step: two symbols. After second step: replace each non-terminal with two symbols, so if you have n non-terminals, then next step would increase the count by n each time.\n\nBut wait, that's more complicated. Perhaps a better way is to consider the length: starting from S, each replacement step can double the number of non-terminals. Wait, maybe the length of the string (number of terminals) should be one more than the number of non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.\n\nEach time you apply a production, you might end up with more symbols. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So when you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, you're adding one non-terminal, increasing the number of symbols by one. When you replace a non-terminal with a terminal, the number of non-terminals decreases by one, but the number of terminals increases by one.\n\nSo starting from S with 0 terminals, after k steps of replacement, the number of terminals would be... Hmm, maybe it's easier to model it as the maximum possible terminals.\n\nWait, let me think in terms of how the string length relates to the number of productions. The string length is 9, which suggests that the number of terminals is 9, so the number of non-terminals must have been 8, assuming each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, if each production can add one terminal or two non-terminals, starting from S, the total number of terminals possible at the end varies, but 9 is a possible number if the derivation ended correctly.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to use a parse tree approach. Each internal node has exactly two children (since it's CNF), so the parse tree would be a binary tree. The number of leaves (terminals) in such a tree is 2^d, where d is the depth. However, the string given has 9 terminals, which is not a power of two, so that suggests that the string cannot be generated by any derivation in CNF, as the number of terminals would have to be a power of two.\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, and 2^4 is 16, so 9 is between them. Therefore, the string's length doesn't fit, implying it's not possible to be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure because maybe there's a way to have non-terminals that result in more complex derivations"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It's presented with production rules, which are all in the form A \u2192 BC, except for the terminals, which are the lowercase letters (like t20, t72, etc.). Each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side except for the ones that directly produce a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t72 t71 t30 t90 t50 t48 t93 t20 t63`.

Let's map these to their terminals to see if the string can be built using the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t72 t71 t30 t90 t50 t48 t93 t20 t63.\n\nBreaking it down into tokens:\n\n1. t72\n2. t71\n3. t30\n4. t90\n5. t50\n6. t48\n7. t93\n8. t20\n9. t63\n\nSo, 9 tokens to produce. Now, I need to see how each of these can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLet's start with t72. Looking at the production rules, NT72 can produce 't2' and possibly other things. Wait, in the rules, NT37 \u2192 't2', and NT72 can be broken down via other rules. Let me check. In the rules, I don't see NT72 directly producing a terminal except in NT72's production through other symbols.\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, and NT65 has some productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT72: it's defined as NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nBut NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46 (from the rules). So, actually, we need to see if there's a way to get 't72' as a terminal. Let me check NT37: NT37 \u2192 't2'. NT65 \u2192 't56'? Wait, no, NT65\u2192't56'? Checking the rules, NT65 \u2192 't56'?\n\nWait, let's look: NT52 \u2192 't97' (so NT97 is a terminal), NT13 \u2192 't50' (terminal), NT37 \u2192 't2', NT34 \u2192 't60' (terminal), NT51 \u2192 't87' (terminal), NT39 \u2192 't80' (terminal), NT60 \u2192 't49' (terminal), NT41 \u2192 't16' (terminal), NT26 \u2192 't13' (since it's defined as that in the rules), NT65 \u2192 't56'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT52 \u2192 't97', NT13 \u2192 't50', NT37 \u2192 't2', NT34 \u2192 't60', NT51 \u2192 't87', NT39 \u2192 't80', NT60 \u2192 't49', NT41 \u2192 't16', NT26 \u2192 't13', NT65 \u2192 't56', etc.\n\nSo NT72 is in the left-hand side of a production, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT72 directly producing a terminal. So to get 't72', it must come from a non-terminal that eventually can produce 't72'.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Looking at the productions, I don't see any NT producing 't72' directly. But maybe through other routes.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the given rules, NT72 is present as a symbol, but it's not a terminal. It's a non-terminal that's defined via other non-terminals.

But others, like NT24 -> t24, produce a single terminal.\n\nSo, t24 can be generated by NT24.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- t80: Let's see, in NT65 -> NT59 NT65, but no terminal. Looking for a rule that ends with t80. Checking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t80. So perhaps t80 is produced via a multi-step derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the grammar step by step to see if the string can be formed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a parse tree or use the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, perhaps I should look for substitutions starting from the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is longer than what can be handled by the grammar, but it's 10 tokens. Let me see.\n\nWait, S starts as NT29 NT21. So the string is the concatenation of something from NT29 and something from NT21. So part1 (from NT29) and part2 (from NT21) must each be non-empty.\n\nLooking at part2: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, because the start is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so part2 is NT21, which must expand into a sequence that ends with t51 or t16? Wait, let me check NT21's rules:\n\nNT21 appears in the rules as S -> NT29 NT21, and NT21 -> NT55 NT52, and NT52 -> 't63' which is a terminal? No, wait, in the rules, some NTs have multiple NTs on their RHS, but others have terminals. For example:\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT13 -> 't50', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT26 -> 't13', which is a terminal.\n\nSo some rules produce terminals, either directly or through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work from the end of the string, trying to see if each token can be produced by an NT rule.\n\nLet's take the last token: t51. Looking for NT rules where t51 is a terminal. Checking the rules:\n\nLooking for NT rule where RHS includes t51. Let's see:\n\n- NT37 -> t2\n- NT60 -> t49\n- NT65 -> t56\n- NT1 -> t73\n- NT71 -> t90\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT33 -> t29 t34\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19, which then may produce t5 or t19\n- NT37 is 't2'\n- Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let's re-express all the rules for NTs that produce a single terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the NTs that directly produce a single terminal are:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT33 \u2192 t29 t34 (but no single terminal)\nWait, no, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly. Alternatively, looking through each rule:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 t93 t58? Not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

The string is `t30 t60 t90 t91 t63 t87 t60 t56 t20 t63 t20`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar rules, I can see that many of them are combinations of non-terminals, and some directly reference terminals like 't30', 't60', etc. So, each terminal in the string must match one of these productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the derivation of the string should correspond to a leftmost derivation where every step splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are then compared to the string.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: `t30`, `t60`, `t90`, `t91`, `t63`, `t87`, `t60`, `t56`, `t20`, `t63`, `t20`. \n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string has 11 tokens. I should check if the grammar's start symbol, which is S, can generate this string. To do that, I'll trace the possible leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT29 NT21. So, the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT29 NT21. \n\nNow, I need to substitute each non-terminal in this sequence step by step. The next step is to replace NT29 and NT21. \n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT29 appears in rules like NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT29 also appears in NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t30.

The grammar is provided, along with the string, and I have to figure out whether the string can be derived from the start symbol using the productions of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the given grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

Because in CNF, the productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the string that the grammar can generate is a sequence of terminals. So the string given is `t2 t18 t71 t48 t11 t23 t50 t13 t73 t71 t24`, which is a sequence of terminals.\n\nNow, my goal is to see if each terminal in this string can be derived from the grammar's start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is a non-terminal breaking down into two non-terminals or a terminal.

Let's see how to derive 't72' in the string.\n\nAssuming that the first step is to have S generate a sequence that starts with t72. But S is S -> NT29 NT21, so S can't directly produce the first symbol as NT72. Therefore, the starting assumption is that S must produce a sequence that includes NT72 as the first symbol.

Hmm, okay, the string is all these t-something things, like t56, t13, etc. I remember that in CNF grammars, each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So the left-hand side is always a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string step by step.

Wait, no. Let me check: NT33 \u2192 't23', but I have t33 in the string. Wait, that's a problem. Is there any production for NT33 that gives 't33'? Looking at the rules, no, all rules for NT33 produce another non-terminal or 't23', so NT33 can't produce 't33'. Hmm, that's a red flag.\n\nWait, the string has t33. So if we have t33, we need a production that can produce it. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that when expanded, can produce t33. Checking NT33's rules:\n\nNT33 -> NT29 NT34\n\nWhich then leads to NT29 and NT34. Both of those produce terminals.\n\nNT29 \u2192 't48'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't60'\n\nSo, from NT33, you get t48 and t60. No 't33'. So, that can't produce 't33'. Therefore, the string must have an error here.\n\nWait, but the string includes t13, which comes from NT26, and t33, which... can NT33 produce anything else?

Hmm, Chomsky normal form grammars have productions that are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to make sure it's in CNF. The productions seem to be of the form NT followed by two other NTs or terminals. So yes, it's in CNF. \n\nThe string starts with t56, t93, and so on. The grammar has terminals, represented by lowercase letters, which are the tokens we see in the string. Our task is to see if the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nI notice that the grammar is quite extensive with several non-terminals, so I'll need to track which non-terminals can generate which terminals. Also, since each production is binary (either two non-terminals or a terminal), the leftmost derivation will build the string step by step.\n\nLet's list the productions where terminals appear as results:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT5 \u2192 't93'\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT41 \u2192 't16'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18' or 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't93'\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT49 \u2192 't49' (wait, NT49? No, in the grammar, I see NT65 \u2192 't56', so perhaps that's a typo but I think NT49 isn't defined; perhaps I need to check.)\nWait, looking again, the terminals appear under NT24, NT37, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t60\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18 or t72\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT24 \u2192 t24 (maybe this is for 't24')\nWait, some terminals are written directly, like NT24 under NT62 as 't24'. So when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, it's straightforward.\n\nSo each token in the string corresponds to a production from some non-terminal. The key is to find a way to derive the entire string using the productions.\n\nLet me approach this by building the parse tree. Since the string is given, I can work from the start symbol, S, and see if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nFirst, the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is NT29 NT21. So, S can produce these two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals will have their own productions. \n\nI see that the string consists of a series of terminals: t24, t90, t16, t48, t11, t56, t50, t2, t80, t30, t80, t23, t97. Each of these corresponds to specific non-terminals, as indicated in the grammar. For example, t24 is produced by NT24, t90 by NT90 (which is actually NT0), and so on.\n\nWait, the grammar has some parts where non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For instance, NT24 -> 't24', so whenever NT24 appears, it produces 't24'. Similarly, NT37 -> 't2', which is another terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can start from the start symbol S and apply the productions to see if the string can be generated. Since Chomsky Normal Form is used, I can do this step by step, building the string from the start.\n\nLet me list out all the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> t11\n- NT1 -> t73\n- NT47 -> 't47' (Wait, looking again, I think I might have a typo.

{"custom_id":"request-200","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. CNF is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I'll need that here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t87 t60 t93 t15 t56 t20 t30 t16 t35 t30 t71 t30 t15`.\n\nI notice that many of these `t` terms are part of the terminal productions in the grammar. For example, some NT symbols expand into specific `t` tokens. My plan is to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string by expanding non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which according to the grammar, is:\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the production are NT29 and NT21. Looking at the grammar, each NT has two options, either producing two NTs or a `t` token.\n\nLet me check the string for t29 and t21. The string starts with t23, which isn't t29, so maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string is generated in a way that the productions need to be followed step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to generate the string using the grammar. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so I can treat them as a list: [t23, t87, t60, t93, t15, t56, t20, t30, t16, t35, t30, t71, t30, t15].\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be formed by expanding the non-terminals from S.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT29 NT21. So the derivation starts with NT29 \u2192 ... and NT21 \u2192 .... Each of these can produce either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLooking at each part:\n\n1. NT29: From the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, I need to expand NT0 and NT58 further.\n\n2. NT21: From the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT52. Then, looking at NT20, which can be either NT2 NT55 or specific terminals. Wait, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55 or 't18'. But in the string, the next token after t29 is t87, which doesn't match t18, so maybe NT20 isn't a terminal but produces NT2 NT55. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the string, after NT29 (which is t29), the next token is t87, which could correspond to NT87, but the grammar doesn't have an NT87. Wait, let me check the grammar symbols again. The NT symbols are things like NT29, NT87 isn't listed, so perhaps I got this wrong.\n\nWait, the string is `t23 t87 t60 t93 t15 t56 t20 t30 t16 t35 t30 t71 t30 t15`. Wait, looking again, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write down the string with indexes: 0:t23, 1:t87, 2:t60, 3:t93, 4:t15, 5:t56, 6:t20, 7:t30, 8:t16, 9:t35, 10:t30, 11:t71, 12:t30, 13:t15.\n\nNow, S is NT29 NT21, so first, I need to see how NT29 and NT21 can expand.\n\nLet's start with NT29. According to the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, I need to expand NT0 and NT58.\n\nLooking at NT0: The grammar has NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT19. Then NT5 can be expanded further.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should consider the entire string and see if each non-terminal in S can be expanded to produce the corresponding tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a parsing approach. Let me try to write down the possible expansion.\n\nStarting with S: NT29 NT21\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28 (from NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28)\n\nNT52 can be either NT10 NT19 or a terminal. NT52 \u2192 NT10 NT19.\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nHmm, this seems too deep. Maybe I should look for any terminals that match in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t23, so maybe one of the NTs must directly produce t23. Looking through the grammar symbols, I see that some have terminals as direct productions, like NT33 \u2192 t29, but wait: looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT symbols that directly produce a 't' token:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n\n- NT6 \u2192 Not in the grammar\n\nWait, checking each rule:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n\n- NT25 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, no, let's check each rule that ends with a 't':\n\nNT2 \u2192 t5\n\nWait, no, the productions are:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with 't' as the last symbol. For example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t20\n\nNT34 \u2192 t60\n\nNT20 \u2192 t18\n\nNT71 \u2192 t90\n\nNT55 \u2192 t34\n\nNT15 \u2192 t71\n\nWait, I'm looking for any production where the right-hand side is a single 't' symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many production rules have the form A\u2192BC, where BC are NTs. So the only way a 't' can appear is as the terminal in a production like A\u2192 ... a.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n\nYes, so NT58 can produce t20. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 t60; NT29 \u2192 t29; but wait, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which are both non-terminals, so unless they can expand to 't's.\n\nLooking at the string again: the first token is t23. I need to see if any non-terminal in the grammar can directly produce t23.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any production rules for NT have t23 as a terminal? Looking:\n\nLooking at each production in the grammar:\n\nHmm, I don't see any production where the RHS is a single 't23'. All the NT symbols expand into two NTs. So unless one of those NTs can produce t23, the first token being t23 can't be derived. But none of the NTs directly produce t23, so maybe the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I miss any NT that can produce t23?\n\nLooking at all NT symbols:\n\n- NT23: The grammar doesn't have NT23; the closest is NT24 \u2192 t91, etc., but no NT23.\n\nSo, if none of the NTs directly produce t23, then the string cannot be derived because the first token is t23, which isn't produced by any direct production.\n\nWait, the grammar only has productions that produce two NTs, except for certain NTs that produce terminals. For example, NT58 can produce t20. But t23 isn't a terminal of any NT.\n\nSo, the first token in the string is t23, which would require some NT symbol to directly produce it, but in the given grammar, there's no such rule.

The string is `t60 t33 t87 t51 t50 t16 t30 t51 t80 t2 t80 t50 t80 t48`.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That structure should help in analyzing the parse.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the string. The string consists of a series of terminals connected by spaces. Each terminal starts with 't', followed by a two-digit number, except for 't71', 't90', etc., which have two digits. I notice that 't' followed by two digits are the terminals here.\n\nThe grammar's right-hand sides consist of non-terminals and terminals. The initial symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals. So the first step is to check if these non-terminals can derive into sequences of terminals that match the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at NT29 and NT21: \n\n- NT29 is defined as NT60 + NT0 (from the productions NT60 and NT0). Wait, in the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT60. No, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, the grammar's rules are a bit confusing because some were miswritten. Let me recheck the productions. Wait, I see:\n\nThe grammar provided has:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT60 (but wait, looking at the list, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list them properly.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules provided, I need to find for each non-terminal what their productions are. For example:\n\nLooking for NT29: Hmm, let me scan through the provided grammar rules:\n\nLooking at NT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nNT0 -> NT93\n\nWait, but perhaps NT29 is part of a production, e.g., NT29 -> something. Wait, no, I should check each non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nIs there a NT29? Let me check: Hmm, yes, in the grammar, we have:\n\nNT29 -> is it any production? Wait, let me go through each line.\n\nThe first three lines after S are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nHmm, so no NT29 production is listed. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me list all the productions to make sure.\n\nWait, maybe NT29 is defined as NT59 NT60, but I need to check.\n\nLooking further, I see:\n\nNT29 appears as the left-hand side in the production: \n\nI think I might be missing something.

So perhaps NT29 is only used as a non-terminal in S, and nowhere else. So when S is expanded, it's replaced by NT29 and NT21. Then those non-terminals need to expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nSo the initial string starts with t60, which would need to come from one of the terminal productions.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can see that NT5 \u2192 t93, NT34 \u2192 t60, NT39 \u2192 t80, etc. So various non-terminals derive into terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with t60. So the first part of the string is t60. Looking for which non-terminal can derive into t60.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT34 \u2192 t60. So if NT34 can derive into t60, then maybe the first part comes from NT34.\n\nWait, but in the initial expansion, from S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the string has to be derived from NT29 and NT21. Let's see what NT21 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production for NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Because in line 29, NT1 \u2192 NT21 NT24, but NT21 is in line 41: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list again, the line for NT21 is line 41: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So NT21 is NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Then NT55 produces what? Looking at the productions, line 23: NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34. So NT55 is NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\nAnd NT10 is line 31: NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19. So NT10 is NT5 followed by NT19. NT5 is line 49: NT5 \u2192 t93, so NT10 is 't93 NT19'.\n\nNow, NT19 is line 19: NT19 \u2192 NT10 NT65. Wait, that's a problem because NT19 \u2192 NT10 NT65. But NT10 is NT5 followed by NT19, which seems to create a cycle here."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-228","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. So, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol, which can have a single non-terminal. But looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions start with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S is the start, and the string we're checking should be derived from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t71 t51 t97 t91 t63 t71 t48 t51 t16 t48 t50 t18 t90 t35 t51\". Since the string ends with t51, I need to see how each of these tokens corresponds to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string ends with several t's, which according to the grammar's productions, each correspond to one or two non-terminals. For example, t71 is produced by NT71, t51 by NT51, and so on. So the idea is to see if each t can be mapped to a rule in the grammar, and whether the overall structure can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the production S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the string must start with whatever NT29 produces and end with whatever NT21 produces. Let's see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT1\nNT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n... (and others, but need to check NT29's rules)\nWait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nThere's NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT1, and others for NT29? Wait, looking back, the user provided the entire grammar, but maybe it's too extensive. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the productions for NT29 are:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT1\n\nIs there another production for NT29? Let me check the user's grammar. Yes, here's NT29: NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT1.\n\nSo NT29 produces NT59 and NT1. Now, NT1 is another non-terminal, which from the productions, looks like NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, and so on. Let's see what NT1 produces.\n\nWait, let's look through the grammar step by step.\n\nThe string ends with ... t48 t51 t16 t48 t50 t18 t90 t35 t51.\n\nSo the first token is t71, which comes from NT71. From the grammar, NT71 \u2192 NT10 NT65.\n\nThen t51 comes from NT51, which \u2192 NT50 NT2. Then t97 is from NT28, but wait, t97 is actually produced by NT19, right? Let me check NT0: 't93', NT50: 't71', NT52: 't63', etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's NT19 \u2192 NT15 \u2192 ...? Wait, I might be getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to parse the string as a series of steps, each token corresponding to a non-terminal that's been expanded. Let's try parsing the string from the end backwards, using a technique called reverse analysis.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt71 t51 t97 t91 t63 t71 t48 t51 t16 t48 t50 t18 t90 t35 t51\n\nLet me list them in reverse order:\n\nt51, t90, t35, t51, t18, t50, t48, t16, t48, t63, t71, t91, t63, t51, t71, t97\n\nWait, no, the reverse would be the end to the beginning. Let's write them in reverse:\n\nOriginal: [t71, t51, t97, t91, t63, t71, t48, t51, t16, t48, t50, t18, t90, t35, t51]\n\nReverse order: [t51, t35, t90, t18, t50, t48, t16, t48, t91, t63, t71, t97, t71, t51, t97]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. To reverse the list, the last element comes first. So, it should be:\n\nt51, t35, t90, t18, t50, t48, t16, t48, t91, t63, t71, t97, t71, t51, t97\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the number of elements. Let me count them to ensure:\n\nOriginal string has 15 tokens. So the reverse will also have 15 tokens, starting from the last t51 and going back to the first t71.\n\nWait, no, the original string is 15 tokens: 0 to 14. So in reverse, it starts at position 14: t51, then 13: t35, 12: t90, 11: t18, 10: t50, 9: t48, 8: t16, 7: t48, 6: t91, 5: t63, 4: t71, 3: t97, 2: t71, 1: t51, 0: t71.\n\nWait, that can't be, because position 14 is t71, 13 is t51, 12 t97, 11 t91, 10 t63, 9 t71, 8 t48, 7 t51, 6 t16, 5 t48, 4 t91? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list them properly.\n\nThe string is:\n\nIndex 0: t71\nIndex 1: t51\nIndex 2: t97\nIndex 3: t91\nIndex 4: t63\nIndex 5: t71\nIndex 6: t48\nIndex 7: t51\nIndex 8: t16\nIndex 9: t48\nIndex 10: t50\nIndex 11: t18\nIndex 12: t90\nIndex 13: t35\nIndex 14: t51\n\nSo reverse order is from index 14 to 0:\n\nt51 (index14), t35 (13), t90 (12), t18 (11), t50 (10), t48 (9), t16 (8), t48 (7), t91 (6), t63 (5), t71 (4), t97 (3), t71 (2), t51 (1), t71 (0).\n\nSo the reversed token list is: [t51, t35, t90, t18, t50, t48, t16, t48, t91, t63, t71, t97, t71, t51, t71].\n\nNow, starting from the end of the string, which ends with ... t51 t71 t48 t51 t16 t48 t91 t63 t71 t97 t71 t51 t71.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to represent this as a list of non-terminals:\n\nEach t in the string is the result of expanding a non-terminal. So the last t51 is from NT51, which \u2192 NT50 NT2.\n\nBut perhaps reverse analysis is better.\n\nLet's start from the last token, t51, which is produced by NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT2.\n\nWait, let's make this systematic. Start from the end and see if each token can be matched to a non-terminal rule.\n\nStep 1: The last token is t51, which comes from NT51. Now, NT51 \u2192 NT50 NT2. So in reverse, the last step is generating 't51' which is the result of NT51. So before that, the string must have ...

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It looks like every non-terminal (the parts starting with NT) can produce two other non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and a few single tokens like 't97', 't50', etc., which are probably terminal symbols. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t30 t24 t48 t20 t80 t49 t11 t93 t87 t23 t16 t87 t63 t60 t2`.\n\nSince the string is broken into tokens, each token corresponds to a production step. So I need to see if starting from S, after applying productions and eventually reaching terminals, I can get this exact sequence of terms.\n\nLet me list out the grammar rules:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT21\n2. NT47 -> NT59 NT15\n3. NT26 -> NT24 NT72\n4. NT20 -> NT2 NT55\n5. NT64 -> NT59 NT37\n6. NT65 -> NT15 NT65\n7. NT46 -> NT39 NT59\n8. NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n9. NT38 -> NT58 NT34\n10.

NT71 -> 't90'\n64. NT19 -> 't15'\n65. NT68 -> 't30'\n66. NT33 -> 't23'\n67. NT5 -> 't11'\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals like NT24 have two productions now: one is NT24 -> NT10 NT57 and another is NT24 -> t24. So 't24' is a terminal, meaning that NT24 is a terminal, right? Because when a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it's considered a terminal itself? Or is it because sometimes it can also produce non-terminals, but in this case, it can produce a terminal, but also other options.\n\nWait, so in the context of parsing, a non-terminal is a symbol that can be replaced by a sequence of other symbols (including terminals and non-terminals). If a non-terminal has a production that directly results in a terminal symbol, that's fine. So in this case, NT24 has two productions: one is to NT10 NT57, and the other is to 't24'. So 't24' is a terminal, and NT24 can be replaced by 't24' as well as NT10 NT57. So both NT24 and NT10 could be involved in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, wait no, if NT24 has a production to 't24', then in the parse tree, NT24 can be a terminal, but perhaps it also can lead to more non-terminals. But in this case, the two productions for NT24 are both possible: one is a terminal (t24) and the other is a combination of NT10 and NT57.\n\nSo in this grammar, multiple non-terminals can produce terminals. So perhaps the key is to see if the string can be built by following these rules step by step.\n\nBut the given string is: t30 t24 t48 t20 t80 t49 t11 t93 t87 t23 t16 t87 t63 t60 t2.\n\nWait, that's 15 tokens. Let's list them again for clarity:\n\n1. t30\n2. t24\n3. t48\n4. t20\n5. t80\n6. t49\n7. t11\n8. t93\n9. t87\n10. t23\n11. t16\n12. t87\n13. t63\n14. t60\n15. t2\n\nSo we need to see if starting from S, which produces NT29 NT21, and then each of those can be parsed down to the terminals in the order above.\n\nLet me sketch a possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNow, let's process NT29 and NT21 as separate branches.\n\nFirst, process NT29:\n\nLooking at NT29, what do I know? From the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT29. Wait, let me check the productions.\n\nWait, the productions for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68.\n\nWait, looking at the list again, NT29's production: oh, in the list above, the 28th production is NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34. So NT29 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT33 NT34.\n\nBut wait, I don't see a production for NT29 in the initial list provided. Wait, looking back, the user's message lists 39 grammar rules. Let me check all of them:\n\nLooking through, I see NT29 in rule 28: NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\n\nWait, so that means NT33 produces NT29 and NT34, but NT29 itself isn't a non-terminal in any other rule except maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, in the initial list provided, I see rule 29: NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\n\nSo the only production for NT29 is as part of NT33's production. But where is NT29's own production? It seems that NT29 is a non-terminal, but in the given rules, the only rule involving NT29 is as a component of NT33's production.\n\nSo looking through all the given rules, does any non-terminal directly produce NT29?

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each rule produces two non-terminals. Since the string consists of terminals (like 't16', 't90'), I need to see how these terminals appear in the grammar expansion.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. It expands to NT29 NT21. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Now, each NT is a non-terminal, so I need to expand these.\n\nStarting with NT29: Looking at the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT21. So replacing S's expansion gives NT59 NT21 NT21.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me correct that. S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT21, so replacing NT29 gives NT59 NT21 NT21.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, as per the rule NT21 -> NT55 NT52. So now we have NT59 NT55 NT52 NT52.\n\nBut wait, NT59 can expand further. There's a rule NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but also NT59 \u2192 other things. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nAnd another rule NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 appears in several places, so each term needs to be expanded.\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe an alternative approach is better. Instead of expanding all the way, maybe I can map the terminals in the string to see if they can connect through the grammar.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't16'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT11 \u2192 't11', NT15 \u2192 't71', NT24 \u2192 't24', NT35 \u2192 't35', etc.\n\nLet me see each terminal in the string and check if they can be derived.\n\n1. 't16' comes from NT41, as per NT41 \u2192 't16'.\n\n2. 't90' is from NT72. Looking at the rules, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37. Then, check NT65 and NT37.\n\n3. 't80' comes from NT64, because NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37.\n\n4. 't56' is from NT52, as NT52 \u2192 't56'.\n\n5. 't60' is from NT60, so checking where NT60 is derived from. NT60 appears as a terminal, yes.\n\n6. 't72' is NT72, which we've already seen.\n\n7. 't60' again, same as above.\n\n8. 't60' again.\n\n9. 't35' is NT35? Wait, no. NT35 doesn't appear as a starting point. Wait, maybe NT58 can produce 't35'. Checking rules: NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34, and NT38 expands to 't35' via NT38 \u2192 't35'.\n\nWait, let me list the terminals and see their sources:\n\n- 't16' \u2192 NT41.\n\n- 't90' \u2192 NT72.\n\n- 't80' \u2192 NT64.\n\n- 't56' \u2192 NT52.\n\n- 't60' \u2192 NT60.\n\n- 't72' \u2192 NT72.\n\n- 't60' again.\n\n- 't60' again.\n\n- 't35' comes from NT38 via NT38 \u2192 't35'.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT21. So now we have NT59 and NT21.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nSo now, it's NT59 NT55 NT52 NT52.\n\nNT59 can expand in multiple ways: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, or NT33 NT41, or others. I'll choose one:\n\nFirst, choosing NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nSo now, NS \u2192 NT0 NT58 NT55 NT52 NT52.\n\nBut wait, this might complicate things. Maybe choosing a different path for NT59.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a path that could produce the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, let's consider each symbol in the string and track possible derivations.\n\n1. 't16' at the start must come from NT41: So the first part of the string starts with NT41 \u2192 t16.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT41 could be a non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals or terminal.\n\nLooking back, the rules: NT41 \u2192 't16' is the only rule I see for NT41.\n\nSo, the initial part is S \u2192 NT29 NT21 \u2192 ... which doesn't directly produce t16. So perhaps 't16' comes from a different expansion path.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let me map each step.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the entire string and see if it can be partitioned into sequences of NTs that match the grammar.\n\nThe string has 16 tokens: t16, t90, t80, t56, t60, t72, t60, t60, t35, t24, t15, t35, t51, t93, t30, t71.\n\nI need to group these into a series of NT pairs derived from S \u2192 NT NT.\n\nFor example, S starts as N1 N2, which are two non-terminals. Each of those can themselves be non-terminals, so I can split the string into such pairs.\n\nLet me attempt this:\n\nLooking at the string, it's 16 tokens, which is even, so maybe possible to split into 8 pairs.\n\nLet's check the first two tokens: t16 and t90.\n\nIs there a rule where NT-> t16 and another NT-> t90? Or more accurately, is there a production where two non-terminals on the left expand into these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT41 \u2192 t16.\n\nNT72 \u2192 perhaps can be split into t90 and t80?\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT is NT35 producing t35, but looking for the first token is t16, so it's from NT41.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find how NS \u2192 NT29 NT21 expands and then each of those branches.\n\nAlternatively, let me list all the terminal symbols and see their possible origins:\n\n- t16 \u2192 NT41.\n\n- t90 \u2192 NT72 (since NT72 \u2192 t90 via some rule? Wait, let me see the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT72 rules:\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37.\n\nDo either of these produce terminal symbols?\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46.\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24.\n\nNT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37.\n\nSo this seems too deep. Maybe another path.\n\nLooking at NT60 \u2192 't60' directly.\n\nNT52 \u2192 't56'.\n\nWait, let me see if any NTs produce 't90' directly.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nBut NT65 comes from NT50 NT46, etc. I don't see any NT directly producing t90 except maybe NT72 but it's not direct.\n\nWait, perhaps 't90' is from NT65 NT37. So maybe if NT65 produces t90?\n\nWait, checking NT65 rules: NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46 or NT56 (NT51 \u2192 't87'). Wait, no, NT56 is a different non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT56 rule: Wait, do any NTs produce directly 't90'?\n\nWait, I see NT96 is not present, so maybe t90 comes from NT65.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused.

I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll list all the productions to understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So, S is the root of the parse tree. Each production starts with NT and then has either another NT or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that many non-terminals have productions that eventually resolve to terminals. For example, NT28 -> NT37 NT72, and NT37 -> 't2'. So, any production that leads to a terminal will end the branch.\n\nThe given string consists of a series of terminals. I need to see if these terminals are the leaves of a parse tree starting from S. Each production in the grammar can only generate two symbols at a time, which are either both non-terminals or both terminals.\n\nI can approach this step by step. Starting from S, which is NT29 NT21. I'll check if the string starts with 't50' because S is NT29. Let me look at the productions for NT29. Oh, looking back, NT29-> NT59 NT0. So S would start by producing two non-terminals, NT59 and NT0. But the first symbol in the string is 't50', which is a terminal. NT29 doesn't produce a terminal directly, only non-terminals. So this implies that the string must come from a different starting point, but S is the start symbol. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, S leads to NT29 and NT21. The first symbol in the string is 't50', which must come from either NT29 or NT21, but looking at the productions for NT29, it's NT59 and NT0, both non-terminals. NT21's production is NT55 NT52. Neither of those produce terminals. Wait, but looking again, I see NT5 -> 't93' and NT19 -> 't15', which are terminals, but NT21 doesn't directly produce a terminal. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string isn't directly from S but through some branches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated via a series of productions. Let's see. Maybe the string is a series of terminals that can be derived via the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try building the parse tree step by step. Let's start with S -> NT29 NT21. So the first level is NT29 and NT21. Now, let's see how to generate 't50'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see NT29 or NT21 directly producing 't50', but maybe through some other non-terminals. Let me check each NT production:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT0. So, 't50' would need to be derived from either NT59 or NT0. Checking NT59's productions: NT59 -> NT0 NT58, NT59 -> NT10 NT26, etc. Wait, but NT59 doesn't produce 't50' directly. Hmm. Similarly, NT0's productions include NT29, but it doesn't produce terminals except for NT0 itself, which I don't think is a terminal. Wait, no, NT0 seems to produce 't93', but let me check.\n\nLooking back, I see NT0 -> 't93'. Yes, terminal. NT19 -> 't15', and others. So perhaps 't50' is produced by NT50. Let me check the productions for NT50: NT50 -> NT10 NT24 and NT50 -> NT64 NT24. Wait, no, NT50's production is: NT50 -> NT64 NT24? No, looking back, the productions for NT50 are: NT50 -> NT64 NT24, and NT50 -> NT71 NT65? Wait, let me re-examine the grammar to make sure.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions are:\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\nNT50 -> NT71 NT65\nNT50 -> NT24 NT36\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list provided:\n\nNT50: \n\n- NT50 -> NT64 NT24\n- NT50 -> NT71 NT65\n- NT50 -> NT24 NT36\n\nSo, for NT50, it can produce NT64 NT24, NT71 NT65, or NT24 NT36. All non-terminals except for some that eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo, for 't50' to appear as a terminal, it must come from a production that eventually resolves to it. Let's see: if a non-terminal A can produce 't50', then it's possible. But I don't see any production of NT50 that produces a terminal directly. So I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the NT50 itself is a terminal? No, the productions for NT50 consist of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is 't50 t15...'. Let me consider the entire string: `t50 t15 t30 t13 t56 t63 t51 t33 t35 t56 t33 t23 t87 t23 t13 t23`. That's 16 symbols.\n\nThe first symbol is 't50', which must come from the start symbol somehow, but S is NT29 NT21. S can't directly produce a terminal. So maybe the string is longer than the parse tree, which would require S to produce longer sequences. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the string starts with 't50', which might not be a production of S, but perhaps a non-terminal that eventually produces it.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial non-terminal isn't S, but a derived one that produces 't50'. Let me check for NT0: NT0 -> 't93', but that's not 't50'. Wait, NT50 is a non-terminal. Let's see if NT50 can produce 't50'. From the productions, I don't see NT50 producing any terminals except possibly when it's combined with other non-terminals. For example, looking at the productions of NT50, they all produce pairs of non-terminals, so NT50 itself isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Maybe the start symbol is S, which is NT29 and NT21. Let's see if 't50' can be generated by either NT29 or NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29-> NT59 NT0. Neither of these are terminals. Similarly, NT21-> NT55 NT52. NT55 and NT52 aren't terminals. So how can we get 't50'? Unless, the parse tree starts deeper. So perhaps the initial production is S -> NT29 NT21, and then each of these non-terminals must produce symbols, combining their parts.\n\nWait, so the first step would be to split the string into two parts, one from NT29 and one from NT21. But the string is a single line, so perhaps it's an interleaving of these two sequences, but in the grammar's parse tree, they are separate, so the string should have an equal number of symbols from each part. Let's count: the string has 16 symbols. If each part (NT29 and NT21) produces 8 symbols each, that's 16 total. But I need to see if each part can produce 8 symbols.\n\nBut the string starts with 't50', which would have to come from either NT29 or NT21. Let's first check NT29.\n\nNT29's productions: NT29-> NT59 NT0. So, to get 't50', perhaps NT59 or NT0 can produce it. Let's look at NT59:\n\nNT59's productions include: NT59-> NT0 NT58, NT59-> NT10 NT26, etc. None of these directly produce 't50'. Similarly, NT0's productions are: NT0-> 't93', which is not 't50'. So perhaps NT59 can't produce 't50' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps through some chain. For example, NT59-> NT0 NT58. Then NT0 -> 't93', and NT58-> NT52 NT28.\n\nWait, this seems getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-267","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is `t23 t87 t15 t73 t87 t50 t51 t11 t56 t16 t30 t33 t87 t72 t93 t72 t35`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules provided, they all seem to fit this structure. Each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either terminals or combinations of two non-terminals. So, the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string using this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to NT29 and NT21, but in the given string, the first symbols are 't23' and 't87'. Wait, that's confusing. Because S expands to NT29 and NT21, which should then expand further. But the first two tokens are t23 and t87, which are terminals, not NTs.\n\nWait, maybe the NTs are just a representation, and the actual terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. So perhaps each NT is a non-terminal that eventually expands into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, let's look at the first production steps. The first step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then each of NT29 and NT21 would expand into some sequence of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production for NT29: It doesn't appear in the list provided. Similarly, NT21: It's not in the production list either. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I missed it. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT19 is 't15', NT51 is 't87', NT50 is 't71', NT41 is 't16', NT52 is 't63', NT21 is 't72', NT33 is 't23', and so on. But I don't see NT29 or NT21 defined as producing a terminal, or perhaps they do?\n\nWait, let me check again. Scanning through the list, for example, NT59 appears several times, and one production for NT51 is 't87', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT33 is 't23', which is a terminal. So maybe NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, do we have any production for NT29 or NT21 to a terminal? It doesn't look like it. So perhaps the string can't start with 't23' and 't87' if NT29 and NT21 are not producing terminals, but only combine non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Do any of the provided productions result in 't23' or 't87' as terminals?\n\nYes, for example, NT33 is 't23', NT51 is 't87', NT50 is 't71', NT59 is in multiple places, but one of its productions is 't10' and 't26'. So, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, then perhaps NT23 is not directly in the productions, but maybe through decomposition.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. To check if the grammar can derive this string, I can try to construct a parse tree or a leftmost derivation.\n\nGiven the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT21. Each of these NTs will then expand further. So, starting with S, the first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNow, each NT29 and NT21 will expand into a sequence of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT29: It doesn't directly produce a terminal, but perhaps through expanding into non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, but in the productions, NT29 doesn't appear as a left-hand side. So, perhaps NT29 could be derived from other non-terminals?\n\nWait, no, in a CNF grammar, each production is a single non-terminal breaking into two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, if a non-terminal isn't appearing in the productions except as a left-hand side, then it must be a terminal. Wait, but that's only if it's on the right-hand side. So, if a non-terminal is only on the left-hand side and not producing terminals, it would have to be followed by other non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nBut in our case, the NTs like NT29 and NT21 may not directly produce terminals, so perhaps their expansions will take multiple steps until they produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me see if any of the given productions result in 't23' or 't87', which are the first two symbols in the string.\n\nFor example, NT33 is 't23', NT51 is 't87', NT19 is 't15', NT50 is 't71', NT41 is 't16', NT52 is 't63', NT21 is 't72', and so on.\n\nSo, it seems that some NTs directly produce a single terminal, which can be useful in constructing the string.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't23 t87', which corresponds to NT33 and NT51. So, let's assume that the first NT29 in S's expansion needs to derive to 't23', which is NT33 expanding to 't23'. Similarly, the second NT21 in S's expansion needs to derive to 't87', which is NT51 expanding to 't87'.\n\nBut how can NT29 derive to 't23'? Let me see if there's a production that connects NT29 to NT33, which then produces 't23'.\n\nLooking at the productions, none directly mention NT29 producing NT33. Instead, NT29 is not present as a left-hand side in any rules. So, perhaps NT29 must be a non-terminating non-terminal that expands into other non-terminals until it produces NT33, which then produces 't23'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the expansions work. Maybe NT29 can be derived by other rules. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\nNT47 -> NT29 NT15\n\nWait a minute, NT47 \u2192 NT29 NT15. So, NT29 is part of the right-hand side of NT47. But is there a rule where NT29 is on the left-hand side? The provided rules don't show any production where NT29 is a left-hand side except in the S production via NT29. So, perhaps NT29 can be derived through NT47.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me clarify: in the given grammar, the left-hand sides are all the non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals and terminals. So, to derive 't23', we need a path from NA to 't23', where NA is one of the NTs in the grammar.\n\nSo, NT33 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't23'. So, for NT29 to produce 't23', it must expand into NT33, which then produces 't23'.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 in S's expansion must produce 't87', which is NT51. So, how can NT21 derive into NT51?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT51 \u2192 't87', which is a terminal. So, NT51 is a terminal in this case. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, a non-terminal on the right must expand into either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, NT51 is a terminal node, meaning it cannot be further expanded. But in the given data, the grammar seems to use NT51 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side, but on the right, it's a terminal.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me structure the grammar properly.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is a non-terminal on the left, and the right is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, for example, rules like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, NT59 \u2192 't23' would imply that NT59 can produce either NT0 NT58 or '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-286","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols, each of which comes from either being a terminal or derived from non-terminals according to the grammar rules. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because in CNF, the derivation corresponds to a parse tree where each node has exactly two children (non-terminals) or a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: t60 t20 t91 t87 t23 t56 t13 t48 t20 t15 t18 t72 t93 t30 t72 t63 t23 t97.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string from the left, using the grammar rules. Since it's in CNF, each production either breaks a non-terminal into two non-terminals or directly into terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t60. I need to find which non-terminals can produce t60. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT34 \u2192 t64 NT55, but that's not t60. Wait, let's check the NT59 productions. NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and also NT59 has other rules like NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26, NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41, etc. But none directly produce t60 except NT34 and NT24.\n\nWait, in the end of the string, there's a 't93' which seems to be produced by NT5 and also NT0. Let me check the grammar: NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT58, and NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work from the top of the grammar. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S produces two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. So the entire string should be derived from two parts: first NT29 generating the first part, and NT21 generating the second part.\n\nLet me split the string into two halves to check NT29 and NT21.\n\nThe entire string is:\n\nt60 t20 t91 t87 t23 t56 t13 t48 t20 t15 t18 t72 t93 t30 t72 t63 t23 t97\n\nBut wait, S is NT29 followed by NT21, which both are non-terminals. So their concatenation should form the string. So the left part (from t60 to t23) is generated by NT29, and the right part (t97) is generated by NT21? Wait, but t97 is a terminal, so NT21's production must be something that ends with t97.

The string is \"t72 t35 t30 t60 t60 t15 t56 t87 t71 t93 t63 t16 t13 t91 t48 t48 t11 t20\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol. Wait, actually Chomsky Normal Form is usually where each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but looking at the grammar, most are A \u2192 BC except for some terminals.\n\nWait, let me check: the start symbol is S, which becomes NT29 and NT21. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals. Each production for these non-terminals seems to break down into other non-terminals until they hit terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, the non-terminals eventually lead to terminals like 't72', 't35', etc. So each path from the start symbol to a terminal is a sequence of these productions, ultimately forming a string of terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the beginning. Maybe a recursive descent parser or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to see which non-terminals can produce which sequences and if the given string can be broken down according to these rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't72'. Let's see where 't72' comes from. From the grammar, 't72' is produced by NT72. Let's check NT72 productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n\nAnd 't72' also appears elsewhere, like in NT57, but not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT72, I see:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n\nSo to produce 't72', we need NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, and then NT65 and NT37 should produce the required terminals.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t72 t35 t30 t60 t60 t15 t56 t87 t71 t93 t63 t16 t13 t91 t48 t48 t11 t20\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. t72: So S must produce something that leads to t72. S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the first token is t72, which has to come from NT29 or NT21. Let's see which non-terminals produce t72.\n\nLooking at NT29: From the productions, NT29 appears in NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and also in NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, etc. Wait, I'm not seeing NT29 directly, but let's check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n\nSo to get t72, we must have NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nBut in S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the first non-terminal is NT29. So NT29 must produce something that starts with t72.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT29, I see it's involved in NT39: NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT59. But that's not directly t72. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the ways each non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal (like NT72, NT65, etc.) has productions that split into two non-terminals. So to get a terminal, one of those productions must lead directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n- NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n- NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n- NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n- NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n- NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68\n- NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n- NT20 \u2192 NT72 NT72\n- NT29 \u2192 NT48 (Wait, looking again, I don't see NT29 directly leading to a terminal. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the productions: \n\nFor example, NT47 \u2192 NT51 NT36.\n\nWait, I need to check all non-terminals to see where they can directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT68 NT2\n- NT36 \u2192 NT20 NT48\nWait, but none of these directly produce terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nBut NT0 and NT58 may eventually lead to terminals. Similarly, NT72 is produced by NT65 NT37, which are further broken down.\n\nI think a better approach is to write a simple parser or trace the possible derivations.\n\nGiven the string starts with t72, which must come from NT72. S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the production must be NT29... or NT21...?\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first step is NT29 producing t72. How can NT29 produce t72.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT29:\n\nNT29 seems to be a non-terminal that can produce things like NT59 etc. Wait, I don't see NT29 in the productions except as part of others. Wait, maybe I should list all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about which productions produce t72. So t72 comes from NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nSo in order to derive t72, the parser would use NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, resulting in t72 t...?\n\nWait, but our string is t72 t35 t30..., so the next token after t72 is t35, which implies that the second part of NT72's production (NT37) must produce t35.\n\nSo let's see: NT37 can produce t35. Looking at the productions, NT37 \u2192 NT58 NT2. So NT37 \u2192 NT58 \u2192 ... ?\n\nWait, no, NT37's productions are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT37 \u2192 NT58 NT2.\n\nSo NT37 \u2192 NT58 NT2. To get t35, the second component must produce '35', which is the second part of the string.\n\nWait, 't35' is the second token, so we have t72 (from NT65 NT37), and the next t35 comes from NT37's component.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to represent the entire string as a series of steps derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach or writing out the parse tree.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, maybe it's easier to note that each terminal in the string must correspond to a derivation from a non-terminal that can produce it. Since t72 is in the string, we have that in the first step, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, NT29 must derive to t72, which requires NT29 producing a form that can lead to t72. But from the productions, I don't see NT29 directly leading to t72. Wait, perhaps NT29 is part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, I see NT29\u2192 NT48 (Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking at the list:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT59\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT48 (Wait, is that right? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT29 is not present except as a result of another production, like in S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nWait, no production seems to have NT29 producing directly a terminal except perhaps in another non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should check each non-terminal's possible terminal productions.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that can directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58: No terminals, as NT0 and NT58 derive further.\n\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

For instance, NT34 is rewritten to both 't60' and 't48'. That suggests a conflict. Additionally, NT20 has two different productions, which might lead to ambiguity or allow generating multiple strings with the same non-terminal but different paths.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll try to map the tokens to the grammar by breaking down the string into tokens and see if they can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t87 t91 t35 t90 t90 t48 t90 t13 t71 t23 t91 t50 t51 t49 t71 t33 t90 t91 t91.\n\nLet me start from the end since the grammar starts with S, which is the top symbol. The string starts with t87.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- The terminals are:\n  t87, t91, t35, t90, t48, t23, t50, t51, t49, t71, t33.\n\n- The non-terminals used in the string are:\n  NT1, NT5, NT65, NT47, NT29, etc.\n\nFirst, let's see if t87 can be generated by the grammar. From NT59 -> NT10 NT26, and if NT59 is rewritten, perhaps via NT59 -> t50. But wait, looking at NT59, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> NT71 NT68\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT59 -> NT33 NT41\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT59 -> NT1 NT13\n\nAlso, NT1's production NT1 -> t73.

So where can t87 come from?\n\nLooking for NT that can produce something ending with t87.\n\nLooking at NT51: NT51 -> t87.\n\nSo, if we have NT51, it can produce t87. So, the first step is NT51 -> t87.\n\nNow, the string is t87 followed by t91 t35 ..., so after t87, what is next?\n\nLooking at the grammar, t91 is produced by NT24.\n\nLooking for NT24: NT24 -> t24, or perhaps NT24 is derived further. Wait, no. NT24 has the production NT24 -> NT10 NT57 and also NT24 -> t24. So if NT24 is a terminal, it's t24. But t91 is another token. Hmm, that's a problem because NT24's direct derivation is t24, not t91. Unless t91 is derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the string, after t87 is t91. So after t87, we have t91. For t91, where does it come from? Let's check which non-terminals produce t91.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT47 -> t51\n- NT24's production: NT24 can go to t24, but that's not t91.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed some NT productions that produce t91.\n\nWait, checking all NT productions:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any NT producing t91 directly.

{"custom_id":"request-309","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires each production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol should not be on the right-hand side of any production. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t16 t56 t23 t11 t90 t87 t60 t73 t23 t11 t48 t2 t16 t2 t23 t50 t33 t73 t90`.\n\nI notice that this string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. My task is to parse this string using the given grammar to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list out the relevant productions that map to terminals so I can refer to them:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t93 (again)\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18 (wait, but NT20 is used here. Let me check the grammar again. Yes, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. And NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60, and NT5 \u2192 t93, NT60 \u2192 t49. So NT20 can produce at the terminal level t93 t49, which makes t18 as an intermediate step? Hmm, maybe not, perhaps NT20 can produce t18 directly, but in the given grammar, is NT20 a terminal or a non-terminal? Looking back, the productions don't have NT20 \u2192 something terminal. It only goes down to NT2 and NT55. Wait, but in the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, which further break down. So to produce t18, maybe NT20 can be a non-terminal that doesn't directly produce t18. Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the string, after the first t16, we have t56, then t23, t11, etc. Let me see which NTs correspond to these terminals.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. Wait, so to get t20 from NT20, we have to go through NT2 and NT55, but do those produce t20? Let me check NT2 and NT55.\n\nNT24 \u2192 t24 (so that's a terminal)\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60. NT5 \u2192 t93, NT60 \u2192 t49. So NT2 \u2192 t93 t49, which is t93 and t49 as separate terminals, but in the string, there are t48, t16, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe I should look at the productions where terminals occur and map each terminal to its corresponding NT.\n\nLet me list all the NTs that directly produce a terminal and their corresponding 't':\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 cannot directly produce terminals as its production is NT2 NT55, which break down further into t93 and t49, which I don't see in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps NT20 can produce t18, but in the grammar, I don't see it directly. So maybe the grammar doesn't have a production for NT20 \u2192 t18. Instead, it's down to more non-terminals. So maybe the string cannot include 't18' unless it's derived through a longer path.\n\nBut looking at the string, we have t18 as the 8th element. So that's `t16 t56 t23 t11 t90 t87 t60 t73 t23 t11 t48 t2 t16 t2 t23 t50 t33 t73 t90`.\n\nWait, I'm counting:\n\n1. t16\n2. t56\n3. t23\n4. t11\n5. t90\n6. t87\n7. t60\n8. t73\n9. t23\n10. t11\n11. t48\n12. t2\n13. t16\n14. t2\n15. t23\n16. t50\n17. t33\n18. t73\n19. t90.\n\nWait, 19 elements in the string. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nI need to parse the string starting with NT29 and NT21. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t16, which is part of the first component (NT29), and then t56, which is part of NT21.\n\nWait, no: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT29 produces the first part, and NT21 produces the second part. So the string can be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT29 and the second part by NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first substring is t16 t56 t23 t11 t90 t87 t60 t73 t23 t11 t48.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t16. Let's see which NT can produce t16.\n\nLooking at the productions, t16 corresponds to NT1 \u2192 t73. Wait, no. Let me list again which terminals correspond to which NTs:\n\nWait earlier, I listed:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT23 \u2192 t23?

{"custom_id":"request-328","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t23 t16 t49 t60 t48 t72 t20 t50 t50 t60 t90 t71 t48 t63 t73 t24 t30 t93 t16 t73`, and the grammar has a series of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. Wait, no, CNF actually allows the start symbol to directly produce a terminal, but other non-terminals must have two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Or wait, maybe at the top level, the start symbol can produce a single non-terminal or a terminal. Hmm, no, the definition I recall is that each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S directly produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. Then each of those non-terminals has production rules, for example, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, and eventually, some of these non-terminals directly produce terminals, such as NT24 \u2192 't24'.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, I see lines like NT24 -> 't24' (I think so), which means some of the non-terminals are terminals. So in this case, NT24 is a terminal with symbol 't24', same with NT36 -> 't20', NT19 -> 't15', etc.\n\nSo the string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminal symbols, each corresponding to these rules. The question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst step, perhaps, is to see if the string's structure matches the start symbol's production. S produces NT29 NT21, so the string should start with NT29 and NT21, each of which must produce terminal sequences that combine to the entire string.\n\nSo the first two non-terminals after S are NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first part is 't23 t16 t49...', so the string starts with t23.

{"custom_id":"request-324","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, each starting with S and various NT (non-terminal) symbols. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces: t80 t2 t73 t18 t49 t33 t50 t13 t87 t16 t23 t60 t35 t18 t63 t20 t24 t63 t35 t97.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, each production seems to be breaking down non-terminals into either two non-terminals or a terminal, which fits the CNF structure.\n\nNext, the string is composed of several 't' tokens with numbers. I think each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, t80 is a terminal, t2 is another, etc., all the way to t97. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can apply the production rules step by step to reach the target string. Since the string is quite long, I'll need to be systematic.\n\nLet's break down the string: t80 t2 t73 t18 t49 t33 t50 t13 t87 t16 t23 t60 t35 t18 t63 t20 t24 t63 t35 t97.\n\nI'll try to map each token to a production rule. Starting with the initial symbol S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the string must start with NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first token is t80. So, I need to find a production that can generate t80.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT33 \u2192 't23' and NT50 \u2192 't71', but wait, let me check all the productions for NTs that can produce terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided rules, NT13 \u2192 't50', NT33 \u2192 't23', NT50 \u2192 't71', etc. Hmm, but the first token is t80. Where is t80 in the rules? Looking, I see NT39 \u2192 't80'. So, NT39 can produce 't80'. But how does NT39 get formed? Let me check.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT39 can be derived from NT46 and NT59, as NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59. Wait, no. Wait, looking again, NT39's production is given: NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62. And NT46 has several productions: NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59, NT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to map each token step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, S = NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, the next step is to expand NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 has production rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34 (from the rule NT26 -> NT24 NT55, wait no, let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the grammar provided is as follows:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\n\nNT46 -> NT2 NT10\n\nNT15 -> NT71 NT68\n\nNT59 -> NT33 NT41\n\nNT65 -> NT50 NT46\n\nNT5 -> NT72 NT64\n\nNT57 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT46 NT62\n\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT70 NT47\n\nNT70 -> NT51 NT36\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\n\nNT41 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT33 -> NT29 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT21 NT24\n\nNT62 -> NT1 NT24\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19\n\nNT59 -> NT1 NT13\n\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\n\nNT1 -> NT20 NT60\n\nNT65 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT24 -> NT10 NT57\n\nNT71 -> NT10 NT65\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nNT13 -> 't50'\n\nNT37 -> 't2'\n\nNT34 -> 't60'\n\nNT51 -> 't87'\n\nNT39 -> 't80'\n\nNT60 -> 't49'\n\nNT41 -> 't16'\n\nNT26 -> 't13'\n\nNT65 -> 't56'\n\nNT5 -> 't93'\n\nNT34 -> 't48'\n\nNT0 -> 't93'\n\nNT50 -> 't71'\n\nNT52 -> 't63'\n\nNT24 -> 't24'\n\nNT38 -> 't35'\n\nNT58 -> 't20'\n\nNT20 -> 't18'\n\nNT20 -> 't72'\n\nNT29 -> 't48'\n\nNT24 -> 't91'\n\nNT47 -> 't51'\n\nNT1 -> 't73'\n\nNT71 -> 't90'\n\nNT19 -> 't15'\n\nNT68 -> 't30'\n\nNT33 -> 't23'\n\nNT5 -> 't11'\n\nNT36 -> 't20'\n\nNT19 -> 't33'\n\nWait, so each NT that has a terminal has a single rule with that terminal. So, for example, NT19 \u2192 't15' and NT20 \u2192 't18' (though NT20 is actually S's productions, so maybe that's not the case. Wait, looking again.\n\nLooking for 't80', I see that NT39 \u2192 't80'. So NT39 must be derived from somewhere. Looking at NT39's production, it's NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59, but wait, no: NT39's rule is NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62.\n\nWait, correct production: NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62.\n\nSo, to get 't80', I need NT39 to produce 't80', which requires NT39 to be derived into a string that includes 't80'. But how? Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it as a parse tree. Starting with S, then expanding S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34. Let's say we take that: so the left side is NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34.\n\nNT59 can produce 't97' via NT59 \u2192 't97'? Wait, no, looking above, NT59 has several productions, including NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41, NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26, NT59 \u2192 NT59 NT55, etc. Wait, but in the terminal rules, I see NT59 \u2192 't97' is not present; instead, I see NT62 \u2192 't97' (as NT52 is 't97'). So, is there a direct way to get 't97'? Yes, NT52 \u2192 't97'. But in NT59's productions, there is a rule NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26. But without knowing the exact derivation steps, perhaps it's easier to approach this as a parsing problem, trying to match the string step by step through the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-347","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t93 t87 t60 t56 t15 t73 t51 t72 t20 t20 t16 t56 t90 t30 t60 t13 t2 t15 t90 t90 t71`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing, though here I'm just trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of non-terminals on the left side of the productions. Each production has two non-terminals on the right side except for the ones ending with terminals like 'tX'. For example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58, which translates to the terminals 't93' and 't58' respectively.\n\nSince the string starts with 't93', I need to find which non-terminal produces 't93'. Looking through the rules, I see NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and in the terminals, NT0 is 't93' and NT58 is 't58'. So, the first part of the string 't93' comes from NT59. So, the first non-terminal is NT59.\n\nNow, the string is: `t93 t87 t60 t56 t15 t73 t51 t72 t20 t20 t16 t56 t90 t30 t60 t13 t2 t15 t90 t90 t71`.\n\nSo, after NT59, the next term is 't87'. Looking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 't50' is not relevant here. Wait, 't87' comes from which production? Looking through the terminal rules:\n\n- NT59 -> t93 t58\n- NT57 -> t68 t2\n- NT41 -> t16 NT26 (but 16 is terminal)\n- NT55 -> t10 t34\n- NT71 -> t51 t65\n- NT50 -> t71 t64\n- NT46 -> t35 t59\n- NT39 -> t46 t62\n- NT59 -> t1 t13\n- NT58 -> t20 t28\n- NT55 -> t10 t34\n- etc.\n\nWait, 't87' isn't directly a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see NT57 \u2192 t68 t2, but 't87' must come from some non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't50'\n- NT59 \u2192 't93'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23'\n- NT57 \u2192 't68' t2\n- NT46 \u2192 't35' and 't59'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20' 't28'\n- NT39 \u2192 't46' 't62'\n- NT59 \u2192 't1' 't13'\n- NT55 \u2192 't10' 't34'\n- NT28 \u2192 't37' 't72'\n- NT21 \u2192 't55' 't52'\n- NT10 \u2192 't5' 't19'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13' etc.\n\nWait, 't87' isn't listed as a terminal in any production. That's a problem because all terminals in the grammar must be present. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking at the rule NT59 \u2192 't1' 't13' (since NT13 is 't50'), that's t1 followed by t50, which is 't1t50', but in the string, after some terms, 't87' appears. So perhaps I'm missing a production that leads to 't87'.\n\nWait, perhaps NT59 also produces another combination that includes 't87'. Wait, let me look again at the rules. Oh, I think I missed something.\n\nLooking again, the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58 where NT0 is 't93' and NT58 is 't58' \u2192 t93 t58\n- NT57 -> 't68' and 't2'\n- NT41 -> 't16' and 't26' (since NT26 is 't13')\n- NT55 -> 't10' and 't34'\n- NT1 -> many terminals, but looking at NT1's production, it's broken down further.\n\nWait, perhaps 't87' is part of another production. Let me think. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and building up to the string.\n\nBut S is NT59 NT61. Wait, no. Looking back, the start symbol in the grammar is S \u2192 NT59 NT61? Wait, no, the first rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, looking at NT29, it's not a terminal. Let me check all the non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's list the start symbol. The initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S is non-terminal NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, then NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals, so to generate the string, we start with S = NT29 NT21.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t93, which we found comes from NT59 \u2192 t93 t58. So, how does S connect to NT29 and NT21?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the starting symbol. The first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S is split into these two non-terminals. Then each of these needs to produce sequences of terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t93, which requires NT59 to produce it. So, perhaps the first non-terminal in S is NT59, but that would require NT29 \u2192 NT59, which isn't a production because NT29 doesn't have a production for NT59. Alternatively, maybe S is split into NT29 and NT21, each generating parts of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the tree structure. S is split into NT29 and NT21, each of which needs to generate some substring leading up to the entire string.\n\nSo, maybe the first part of the string comes from NT29 and the second part from NT21.\n\nWait, the string is 21 tokens long, so the split between NT29 and NT21 would be after the first k tokens, where k depends on the production lengths. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal can produce multiple terminals, so the string is a combination of their productions.\n\nBut to make progress, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, starting from the first token and finding which non-terminals can produce the required terminals, then recursively resolving the non-terminals until we reach the start symbol.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nThe string starts with t93, which comes from NT59 \u2192 t93 t58. So, after NT59, the next token must be t58. Looking through the non-terminals, which produce t58. From the terminal rules:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t20 t28. So, t58 requires two terminals: t20 and t28.\n\nLooking at the string: after t93 comes t87. But wait, that doesn't match. So, perhaps my approach is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Each of these can produce a substring. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t93, which requires NT59 \u2192 t93 t58, but NT29 isn't NT59. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for leftmost derivations, so maybe the initial symbol S is NT29 NT21, each generating a part of the string.\n\nWait, but NT29 is not directly connected to t93. Let me look at NT29's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NT29's productions. Wait, in the productions, I see NT29 \u2192 't48' 't60'. So, NT29 produces 't48 t60'. But in the string, the first token is 't93', which is different.

Since it's CNF, the parsing is a bit more straightforward because there are no \u03b5-productions or other complexities, and it's easier to use a recursive descent parser or similar approach.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production. The start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT29 NT21. So, the string must start with the symbols derived from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't13', which corresponds to NT19 -> 't15'? Wait, let's check the grammar rules. Under the grammar, NT13 -> 't50' and NT19 -> 't15' but that's not matching the first token. Wait, wait, the first token is 't13' which is a terminal. Let's look at the rules for NT13: NT13 -> 't50', so 't13' must come from NT13.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't13', which would need to be matched by a rule that produces 't13'. Looking at the grammar, under NT13: NT13 -> 't50', not 't13'. Hmm, that might be an issue. Alternatively, maybe NT13 is not the one; perhaps it's another NT rule that produces 't13'. But looking through, I don't see an NT rule that directly produces 't13'. Let's check all the terminal rules. \n\nLooking at all the production rules for NT where the RHS is a terminal:\n\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n- NT59 -> 't0' (Wait, no, NT0 is 't93')\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

NT24 could produce 't24' or 't91'. So, if the string has 't24', it would come from the first rule, but from the string given, I see 't24' in the middle. So, I need to make sure that each 't' in the string is matched correctly.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with 't13', which isn't directly produced by any NT rule. That's a problem. Let me check the grammar again for any NT rules that produce 't13'. \n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't13'. The only rule with 't13' is for NT19, which is NT19-> 't15'. So, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and it's somewhere else.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each NT rule that ends with a terminal symbol:\n\n- NT5 -> 't93' (correct)\n- NT13 -> 't50' (correct)\n- NT24 -> 't24' (so NT24 can produce 't24')\n- NT33 -> 't23' (correct)\n- NT58 -> 't20' (correct)\n- NT59 -> 't0'\u2014no, 't0' isn't in the string\nWait, the string is `t13 t50 t20 t33 t35 t48 t51 t30 t23 t91 t93 t2 t91 t50 t49 t33 t24 t16 t50 t87 t87`.\n\nSo, first token is 't13'\u2014is there a rule that produces 't13'? Let's see the NT13 rule: yes, NT13->'t50', so that's t50, not t13. So, perhaps that's not possible. Therefore, the string can't start with 't13' if NT13 only produces 't50'. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the first token can't be produced.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT rules. Let me check again. NT13 is defined as NT13->'t50', so the only way to get 't13' is if there's a rule that produces it. Since there isn't, the string can't start with 't13'. So, that's an immediate no.\n\nWait, but double-checking, is there any other NT that can produce 't13'? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT1 -> 't73' (no)\n- NT71 -> 't90' (no)\n- NT10 -> 't93' (no)\n- NT59 -> 't0' (no)\n- etc. None produce 't13'. So, 't13' isn't in the terminal symbols of any NT rule.

Looking at the string: t50 t87 t51 t72 t33 t24 t60 t56 t20 t91 t51 t30 t35 t48 t13 t15 t72 t2 t16 t87 t20 t91.\n\nLooking at the beginning, t50 t87: I need to find which non-terminals expand to t50 and t87.\n\nLooking at all productions for terminals, I see NT10 -> 't19', NT13 -> 't50', NT59 -> 't97', NT21 appears in S as NT21 -> 't18', but wait, looking at NT21: actually, in the grammar, NT21 is used as S's production. But looking through the rules, I don't see NT21 as a terminal; it's probably a non-terminal. So S is NT29 NT21, which we saw.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. Starting from S:\n\n1. S -> NT29 NT21\n   So, each part should expand and when combined, should give the parts of the string in order.\n\nLooking at NT29: in the rules, NT29 -> NT24 NT37. Then NT24 is a non-terminal. From NT24's rules, NT24 -> NT10 NT57. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal productions to understand the terminals better.\n\nTerminals are any non-NT rules ending with -> [terminal]. Let's list all the terminals:\n\nNT59 -> t093\nNT72 -> t21 (Wait, NT72 isn't a terminal; let's recheck. Looking at the rules, NT72: NT72 -> t56. Wait, actually, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 is a terminal? Or wait, no. From the rules: NT0 is a terminal because it appears as -> t93. Yes, so NT0 -> t93 is a terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 -> t20, which is a terminal. NT51 -> t87, NT15 -> t71, and so on.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let's make a list of all the terminal symbols from the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> t97 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT59 is a non-terminal because NT59 -> NT0 NT58, not a terminal. So which NTs expand to terminals?\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58: NT59 is a non-terminal.\n\n- NT47 -> NT51 NT64: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT72: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT64 -> NT59 NT37: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT65 -> NT15 NT65: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT34 -> NT64 NT55: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT60: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT46 -> NT2 NT10: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT15 -> NT71 NT68: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT50 -> NT64 NT24: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT41 -> NT2 NT36: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT33 -> NT29 NT34: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT1 -> NT21 NT24: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT62 -> NT1 NT24: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT59 -> NT1 NT13: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT1 -> NT20 NT60: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT65 -> NT37 NT72: Non-terminal.\n\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57: Wait, NT57 is a non-terminal.\n\nLooking again: seems like many NTs are non-terminals except a few. For example, NT51 -> t87, so NT51 is a terminal. Similarly, NT60 -> t49, NT26 in some rules have terminals like NT26 -> t24... Wait, no. Wait, a rule ending with -> t20 is NT58 -> t20. Similarly, NT15 -> nt71 nt68, which are non-terminals because they don't produce terminals.

Looking at the grammar, I see NT33 \u2192 t23, NT34 \u2192 t48, NT71 \u2192 t90, etc. Wait, maybe I should consider the grammar's right-hand sides to see which non-terminals lead to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree starting from the string and seeing if it can be reduced to S.\n\nAnother approach is to use the leftmost derivation method. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols in the string must correspond to NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t15. So we need NT29 to derive into t15. Let's try to find if NT29 can derive into t15.\n\nLooking at the production for NT29: Looking into the grammar, does any production of NT29 end with a terminal? Let me check:\n\nNT29 is defined as:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT29?\n\nWait, no. Let me list all the NT29 productions. From the given grammar:\n\nNT29 doesn't have an explicit production. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nI think I need to list all NT productions, as that's essential.\n\nLooking back, the grammar entries are listed as NT followed by a number, like NT29. Let's go through each NT and see their productions.\n\nStarting from NT29:\n\nLooking through the given entries:\n\nNT29:\n- NT29 -> NT59 NT29? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because all production rules are either from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or to terminals. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It's a bit extensive, but I can see that there are a lot of production rules for NTs (non-terminals) leading to two other NTs or a terminal. The terminal symbols are the 't' followed by a number, and some like NT0 also seem to eventually produce 't93'. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t90 t23 t24 t2 t51 t18 t97 t23 t56 t20 t16 t13 t48 t50 t72 t23 t87 t97 t91 t60 t93 t23 t23 t35`. That's a long string with 24 tokens. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that a non-terminal can also produce a terminal. Each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one. \n\nThe process to analyze this string is similar to parsing. I can start from the start symbol S and see if it can produce the given string by applying the productions recursively.\n\nThe start symbol is S:\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the first two symbols should come from NT29 and NT21. The given string starts with t90, which is a terminal. Looking at the productions for NT29, I see in the grammar:\nNT29 -> NT59 NT50\n\nHmm, because the string is t90, which is a terminal. But according to the grammar, NT29 is always followed by two non-terminals. That can't be right. So, that would mean that the first token t90 cannot come from NT29, which is a contradiction. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let me think again. The production S \u2192 NT29 NT21 means that the first symbol in the string should come from NT29, and the second from NT21. But in the given string, the first symbol is t90. Let me check if there's any non-terminal that produces t90.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT19 is sometimes used, but it's defined as NT19 \u2192 t15. Hmm, no. Wait, there's also NT51: NT51 \u2192 t87. No, that's not t90. Let me scan each production for a terminal as the first symbol. \n\nLooking through all the NT productions, some produce terminals. For example, NT5 \u2192 t11, NT0 \u2192 t93, and others like NT52 \u2192 t63, etc. So, any of these could be the start.\n\nBut the problem is that S must produce two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first symbol t90 must come from NT29's production, and the second symbol from NT21's production.\n\nLooking at NT29's production: NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT50. So, the first part is NT59, and the next part is NT50. Neither of which produce t90, unless NT59 or NT50 produce a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the NTs: For example, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58. NT0 \u2192 t93. NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. NT52 is used elsewhere, but NT58 does not produce t90. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Since S is the start symbol, and it branches into NT29 and NT21. So, the first token is from NT29. Let's see what NT29 can produce. \n\nLooking through NT29's productions: \n\nFrom the grammar, NT29 can only produce NT59 AND NT50. Then NT59 can produce NT0 AND NT58, which then can produce NT59 and NT37 (I think I misread that... Wait, let me check the NT29 production. The user wrote:\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT29, I see:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT50. That's the production. Now, NT59's production is NT0 and NT58.\n\nSo, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nThen, NT0 \u2192 t93, and NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nSo, from NT29:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21 \u2192 (NT59 NT50) (NT21)\n\nNT21's production is \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nSo, now the entire string starts as NT59 NT50 NT55 NT52.\n\nBut the given first token is t90. Wait, but NT59 starts with NT0, which produces t93. So, maybe in that case, the beginning could be t93. But the given string starts with t90, not t93.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Let's try to map the string and see if the symbols can be generated by following the productions.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to model this as a derivation. Let's think step by step:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the string is built from NT29's expansion and NT21's expansion.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT50 \nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 t93\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT52 \u2192 t63\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nNT37 \u2192 t2\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT65 \u2192 t56\n\nSo, combining this, NT29 expands into t93 t56 t2. But our string starts with t90, not t93. That's a problem because the first symbol generated by S's expansion is t93, which doesn't match t90. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me retrace:\n\nWait, the first two symbols from S are from NT29 and NT21. Let me see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nNT29: S1 (S is split into NT29 and NT21)\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT50\n\nThen NT59 can produce:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nNT0 \u2192 t93.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nNT52 \u2192 t63.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72.\n\nNT37 \u2192 t2.\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nNT65 \u2192 t56.\n\nSo, this entire chain gives t93, t63, t2, t56.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\nNT10 \u2192 t93?\n\nWait, looking back, NT10 is in the grammar: NT10 \u2192 t93? Wait, no. Wait, the production for NT10 is: NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nAnd NT5 \u2192 t11. So, NT10 \u2192 t11 NT19.\n\nBut in the given string, the second symbol after t93 is t23. That might not match.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me think differently. The string starts with t90, which is a terminal. So, t90 must be produced by some NT. Looking through the NT rules, NT51 produces t87, NT50 produces t71, NT55 produces t10 and t34. NT0 produces t93. NT5 \u2192 t11, etc. \n\nBut t90 is not listed as a terminal for any NT. So, how can t90 be in the string? Unless I missed a rule where some NT produces t90, but I don't see that. So, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again for any production that results in t90.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 NT... where the first symbol is a terminal like t90.\n\nHmm, in the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 t15, NT51 \u2192 t87, NT50 \u2192 t71, NT55 \u2192 t10, etc. But no NT produces t90 directly. \n\nSo, if the grammar doesn't have any production that results in t90, how can the string contain t90 at the beginning? That's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t90 can't be produced by any of the NTs in the grammar.\n\nSo, the answer must be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So the top-level expansion would likely involve S \u2192 NT29 NT21, each of which might produce t18.\n\nLet me check what NT29 can expand into. Looking through the rules, NT29 is part of NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which then becomes 't93' and 't58'. But that would not give a t18. So perhaps there's another path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation is deeper. Maybe NT29 breaks down into more non-terminals that eventually produce t18.\n\nLooking at NT29's rules: From the provided rules, I don't see NT29 directly producing anything except as part of other rules.

Let's check if any of these can reach t18 via their productions.\n\nLooking at NT29, its productions are through other non-terminals:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT0 (line 5: NT29 -> NT59 NT0)\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (line 5: NT59 -> NT0 NT58)\nWait, no, line 5 is NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT0, and line 5 is also NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to find a path where each step leads closer to the t18 at the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S needs to be split into NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and each of these should terminate in t18. But looking through the rules, how?\n\nWait, let me see NT29's production:\n\nLooking at NT29's productions:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT0 (line 5)\nNT29 -> NT0 NT58 (line 5?)\n\nWait, actually, looking again:\n\nThe provided rules are:\n\nLine 5: NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT0\nLine 5 (another): NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58? No, line 5 was earlier in the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the detailed rules are more than I can parse, but let me look for any path where NT29 can reach t18.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an indirect path.\n\nWait, looking at some rules:\n\nLine 19: NT19 \u2192 t15\nLine 20: NT20 \u2192 t18\n\nSo NT20 can produce t18.\n\nNow, looking for NT20 in the string, I see a 't18' at position 1 and 2, but then 't33' at position 3, which is early in the string. So perhaps the early 't18' comes from NT20, but where do NT20s come from?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT20 is produced by line 10: NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n\nAnd NT2 is produced by NT70 \u2192 NT51 NT36, and NT51 is 't87', etc. Hmm, that seems like a different path.\n\nWait, let me check if any of the earlier non-terminals can produce t18:\n\nLooking through the rules, line 10: NT20 \u2192 t18, as per line 10 above.\n\nWait, actually, line 10: NT20 \u2192 t18.

{"custom_id":"request-423","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for certain parsing algorithms and for analyzing the grammar structure.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that it's heavily composed of non-terminals on both sides of the productions. My task is to take the string `t91 t93 t2 t35 t49 t97 t93 t93 t35 t51 t51 t97 t33 t24 t50 t20 t23 t15 t30 t18 t50 t30 t33 t93 t30` and determine if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the best approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is used to parse strings according to a given CNF grammar. The CYK algorithm works by building a table that keeps track of which non-terminals can derive each substring of the input string. If at the end, the start symbol S can derive the entire string, then the string is in the language.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can simplify the grammar by looking for the start symbol S and recursively expanding the non-terminals to see if I can break down the string into smaller parts that eventually translate to terminals.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules carefully. The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with the expansions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t91. Let's see which NT can expand to t91. From the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't63' (since in the right-hand side, when NT52 expands, it's a terminal). Wait, wait, looking back, in the grammar, one of the rules is NT24 \u2192 't24', and another is NT52 \u2192 't63'. Hmm, but in the string, we have t91 first.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check each rule for terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like:\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT52 \u2192 't63'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\nWait, but where is t91?\n\nAh, looking further, I realize that NT59 \u2192 't48' but perhaps I'm missing the rules for NT29 and NT47.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT29 \u2192 NT2 NT47, and NT47 \u2192 't41'. Let's check the rules for NT59 and NT24:\n\nWait, no. Let me go back: the string starts with t91. Looking for where 't91' appears. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 't24'. That's one terminal.\n\nLooking for where 't91' is, maybe I should check all NT rules for terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's list all the NTs that expand to terminals:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT66 \u2192 't45' (Not in the given rules, wait no, checking each line)\nWait, in the given lines, perhaps I missed some. Let me go line by line.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n2. NT47 \u2192 NT71 NT1\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Instead of trying to list all, perhaps I can focus on the process.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo if t91 is the first symbol, it must come from one of the NT29 or NT21 expansions.\n\nWait, NT29 is involved in the expansion of S. Let me see what NT29 can expand into. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 appears here: NT28 \u2192 NT42 NT37, and perhaps others.\n\nWait, I may need a better approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can backtrack from the string.\n\nLet me note that the string is a sequence of 't' followed by two-digit numbers. So each token is a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nI need to see which non-terminals (NT) correspond to each of these terminals.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt91, t93, t2, t35, t49, t97, t93, t93, t35, t51, t51, t97, t33, t24, t50, t20, t23, t15, t30, t18, t50, t30, t33, t93, t30.\n\nNow, from the grammar, let's note which NTs produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through each production, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13' and 't18'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT51 \u2192 't87' (wait, but that's not in our string)\nWait, our string has t35, t49, t97, t93, etc.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I should list each terminal and see which NT can produce it.\n\nFrom the given rules, for example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' followed by 't60' (No, that's a production like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58)\nWait, no, perhaps I need to check each rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the given rules are a bit confusing because some terminals appear on the right-hand side.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're evaluating.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all in the form of two terminals or non-terminals on each side. The right-hand sides of these rules are non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals, but looking at the provided rules, it seems like some of them produce terminal symbols, which are given as 'something' in the rules.

Wait, looking back at the grammar, I realize I might have missed the rule for NT38. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nYes, that's correct. So, to get 't35', we must have derived NT38, which comes from NT58 and NT34.\n\nNow, breaking it down:\n\nt35 comes from NT38, which is NT58 (from NT58 is a rule, let me check):\n\nLooking for NT58 in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT2\n\nSo, NT58 produces NT52 and NT2. Now, I need to check what NT52 and NT2 produce.\n\nNT52 -> 't63' from the rules. Check:\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, NT52 -> 't63'.

Let's be precise.\n\nEach rule is of the form A -> BC or A-> something. So, if a non-terminal A has a production A-> B C, then we can split the string into parts generated by B and C.\n\nSo, starting with 't35', which is derived from NT38 = NT58 NT34.\n\nNT58 is derived as NT52 NT2.\n\nNT52 -> 't63' (terminal).\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60.\n\nNow, we have to expand NT5 and NT60 into terminals.\n\nNT5 -> 't93' (from rule NT5 -> 't93').\n\nWait, but in the grammar, does NT5 have multiple productions?

{"custom_id":"request-445","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, but here I'm just trying to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t72 t35 t33 t97 t50 t2 t11 t20 t73 t18 t90 t11 t33 t71 t71 t33 t20 t35 t35 t50 t23 t23 t2 t91 t56 t20`.\n\nSo, first, I should note that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The grammar's non-terminals are all the NT prefixes like NT2, NT4, etc. The goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, ensuring that each step follows the production rules, especially breaking down the string into non-terminals and terminals appropriately.\n\nLet's start by looking at the start symbol S. The production for S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the string must start with the non-terminals NT29 and NT21. Each of these non-terminals will produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Let's break down the string into its components.\n\nLooking at the string: the first two tokens are t72 and t35. Let's see if they can correspond to NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking for the production for NT29: \n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (if applicable) or other productions? Wait, in the grammar, I see NT29 is defined where? Let me scan through the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, the first two symbols t72 and t35 might not directly correspond to NT29, as NT29's production leads to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to figure out what NT29 expands to. Let me look for NT29 in the productions.\n\nAh, yes: NT29 -> NT0 NT58.\n\nSo, NT29 can be broken down into two non-terminals, NT0 and NT58.\n\nThen, the first part of the string would require that. So, does the string start with t72 t35, which would correspond to NT0 and NT58?\n\nLooking for the productions for NT0 and NT58.\n\nNT0 is a production: It seems that NT0 is used in NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but I don't see a direct production for NT0. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, I see NT0 only appears in the production NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but NT0 itself is not further expanded. So, does that mean NT0 is a terminal? No, because in CNF, non-terminals must have productions. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, NT0 is a terminal in this grammar because when NT29 is broken down, NT0 and NT58 must be terminals, but I need to check their productions.\n\nLooking at the list again, I see:\n\nCheck if NT0 has a production. No, in the given productions, NT0 is only on the left side of the production. So perhaps NT0 is a terminal because it doesn't have any further productions.\n\nIf NT0 is a terminal, then when NT29 expands to NT0 and NT58, those must be terminals, but actually, looking at their positions, the string starts with t72 and t35. So, perhaps the production NT29 produces t72 and NT58 produces t35.\n\nWait, but that's a guess. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that NT0 is a terminal, but the problem is that in that case, if NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, then we need NT0 and NT58 to be terminals. So, if in the string, the first two symbols are t72 and t35, that would mean NT0 is t72 and NT58 is t35.\n\nBut looking at the productions, does NT58 produce t35? Or does it have a production?\n\nWait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for NT58: I see NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but that's in the productions. Is there a production for NT58 directly?\n\nWait, no, I don't see NT58 \u2192 anything except in the production of NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, similar to NT0, perhaps NT58 is a terminal.\n\nAssuming that, if NT0 is a terminal 't72' and NT58 is a terminal 't35', then the first two symbols after S would be t72 t35. But in the string, the first two are t72 and t35. So that's matching.\n\nBut let me check if NT0 \u2192 t72 and NT58 \u2192 t35. But in the grammar, there are no direct productions for NT0 or NT58. So that suggests that these are leaves in the parse tree, so perhaps they can't be further split.\n\nWait, but in CNF, every non-terminal must have a production that expands to terminals or non-terminals directly. So, if NT0 and NT58 are non-terminals without any further productions, they can't be expanded further. Thus, they must be terminals.\n\nSo, that would mean that NT0 \u2192 t72 and NT58 \u2192 t35. So, the initial expansion of S is NT29 NT21 \u2192 (NT0 NT58) (NT21). But wait, that's not correct because S's expansion is NT29 and NT21, which would be two separate non-terminals. So, in the string, after S, we have t72 and t35, which would be the first two tokens. But for S \u2192 NT29 NT21, if NT29 is t72 and NT21 is t35, then the string starts with t72 t35, which is correct, but in reality, NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals that can expand into more symbols.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. Instead of looking at the initial expansion right away, perhaps I should try to perform the derivation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent this as a parse tree and see if the string can be built from the root S.\n\nGiven the string is a sequence of tokens, I need to find a way to split it into the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet me outline the string:\n\nt72, t35, t33, t97, t50, t2, t11, t20, t73, t18, t90, t11, t33, t71, t71, t33, t20, t35, t35, t50, t23, t23, t2, t91, t56, t20.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Let me see if I can find the pattern.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to expand.\n\nLet me see what NT29 and NT21 produce. From the list:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nYes, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nSo, S expands to NT29 NT21, which is NT0 NT58 NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals must be expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at the string, after S comes t72, which is the first token. So, let's consider NT29 expanding into some sequence.\n\nFrom NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. Let's check NT0 and NT58.\n\nI don't see NT0's production beyond being part of NT29, so perhaps it's a terminal. Similarly, NT58's production isn't defined beyond being part of NT29.\n\nWait, but in the productions, NT58 is referenced in NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but NT58 itself doesn't have a production. So, similarly, if NT0 is a terminal, then perhaps NT29 \u2192 t72 t35.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I don't have the specific production rules for NT0 and NT58. Without knowing what NT0 and NT58 produce, I can't be certain. But perhaps from the grammar, NT58 must be a terminal. Similarly for NT0.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the NT59"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-443","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. All the rules are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. The terminals in the grammar are t followed by numbers like t97, t51, etc. The string to evaluate starts with t97 and ends with t13.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I'll try to parse the string using the grammar rules. Parsing involves breaking down the string into smaller parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t97 t51 t97 t49 t15 t60 t73 t72 t72 t18 t11 t80 t60 t23 t20 t20 t49 t2 t15 t23 t50 t33 t56 t51 t23 t13.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which allows only two symbols on the right-hand side of each production (A->BC or A->a), I can use a recursive descent parser or another method like the CYK algorithm. However, I'll try a top-down approach to see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the leftmost derivation. Starting from the start symbol S, which according to the grammar, is S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the start is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nI'll need to generate the string by expanding these non-terminals. Let's see what the non-terminals can expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT29 produces t48 or other combinations.\nWait, in the grammar, NT29 is not a non-terminal; looking back, I think the non-terminal symbols are all the uppercase N. So I need to check the productions for the non-terminals. Wait, the grammar rules are provided, and each line defines a production for a non-terminal. For example, S -> NT29 NT21, so that's S producing NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, I'm confused. The grammar is in CNF, so all productions are either terminals or two non-terminals? Or two non-terminals? No, in CNF, each production is A->BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each production either has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. Wait, no, some seem to have two non-terminals, like S -> NT29 NT21, which has two non-terminals. NT47 -> NT59 NT15, etc.\n\nBut some right-hand sides are terminals, like NT59 -> t93, which is a rule where the non-terminal NT59 produces the terminal t93.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with t97. Let me see if the start symbol S can derive t97 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S's rule: S->NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, after S, we have two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nThe first symbol of the string is t97. So perhaps one of these non-terminals, say NT29, produces t97. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules for NT29:\n\nI don't see NT29 defined; wait, looking at the grammar, every line starts with NT followed by some digits, but perhaps I made a mistake. Looking back:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nThen the next line is NT47 -> NT59 NT15.\n\nWait, maybe each NTxyz is a unique non-terminal with specific productions.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me list out all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nNon-terminals:\n\nNT29, NT47, NT26, NT20, NT64, NT65, NT46, NT38, NT34, NT2, NT59, NT72, NT46, NT34, NT2, NT5, etc.\n\nBut this could take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal to its corresponding non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, and to see if it can be generated by the grammar, each terminal must correspond to the right-hand side of a rule, with non-terminals linking them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of the terminals produced by expanding S.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt97 t51 t97 t49 t15 t60 t73 t72 t72 t18 t11 t80 t60 t23 t20 t20 t49 t2 t15 t23 t50 t33 t56 t51 t23 t13.\n\nThis is 25 tokens.\n\nSince S starts with NT29 and NT21, each of those non-terminals must produce a sequence of terminals that, when combined, match the string.\n\nWait, no: the production S -> NT29 NT21 means that S expands into NT29 followed by NT21. So each of them must produce sequences of terminals that, when concatenated, form the entire string.\n\nSo, the entire string must be the concatenation of the productions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo, let me see: can the string be divided into two parts, the first part generated by NT29 and the second by NT21?\n\nLet me look at the string and see possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is a single production, but I think in this context, the string is generated by S, which is NT29 NT21. So the entire string must be generated by expanding NT29 followed by expanding NT21.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production for a non-terminal will either be a single terminal or two non-terminals. So NT29's expansion is a sequence of terminals, followed by NT21's expansion as a sequence of terminals, and together they form the entire string.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if NT29 can generate some sequence, and NT21 can generate another sequence, such that their concatenation is the given string.\n\nAlternatively, if I can derive the string by expanding S.\n\nLet me try to see what NT21 can generate.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions. Wait, from the grammar, I see that S->NT29 NT21, so NT21 is a non-terminal, and I need to find its possible production.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo, NT21 is replaced by NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, each of those non-terminals must be expanded.\n\nLooking for NT55: It has some productions. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT20 -> NT55, but that's a production rule for NT20.\n\nWait, let me list all productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, for each non-terminal, the productions are as listed. Wait, it's a bit time-consuming, but I need to find out what NT21 can derive.\n\nLooking back, S's production is S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo, the first step is that S becomes NT29 NT21, which becomes NT29 NT55 NT52.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no: each production is of A->BC, so when you expand NT21, it becomes NT55 and NT52, which can themselves expand further.\n\nSo, to get the entire string, we have to expand all non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think recursively. The string starts with t97, which is a terminal, so it must be produced by a terminal production. So, we need to see if one of the non-terminals can produce t97.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT59 -> t97. So NT59 can produce t97.\n\nThat's a rule: NT59 -> t97.\n\nBut how does NT59 get into the derivation? Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has the first token as t97, which is produced by NT59. So, to get t97, we must have an NT59 somewhere in the derivation that produces it.\n\nBut our start is S, which is NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps when expanding NT21, we reach NT52, which maybe eventually produces t97? Or maybe NT29 produces t97.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to its possible productions.

{"custom_id":"request-465","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which should make things a bit easier because it simplifies the structure of the productions. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the string and the grammar to see how they might correspond. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t13 t56 t35 t24 t24 t13 t15 t48 t97 t90 t16 t71 t11 t51 t30 t56 t18 t51 t16 t24 t63 t18 t24 t71 t18 t33 t48`. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several productions that directly map to these 't' tokens. For example, NT26->'t13', NT37->'t2', NT5->'t93', and so on. But I also need to see how these tokens can form longer sequences as per the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->\u03c3, where A, B, C are non-terminals and \u03c3 is a terminal string. To check if the string is generated, I can perform a parsing process or simulate the derivation of the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to decompose the string into parts that correspond to the productions. The string is constructed by concatenation of 't' tokens. Each 't' token must come from a production where the left-hand side (LHS) non-terminal can derive that 't' through a series of steps.\n\nI should start by looking at the structure of the grammar and see how the non-terminals can expand into terminals. Let's list out the productions that produce 't' tokens:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT60\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47\n- NT5 -> NT72 NT64\n- NT62 -> NT1 NT24\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT33 -> NT29 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT21 NT24 (from a different rule above)\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT41 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT24 -> 't91'\n- NT47 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT71 -> 't90'\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT24 -> 't24' (another rule)\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't20'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't30'\n- NT33 -> 't48' (another rule)\n- NT15 -> NT71 NT68\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36\n- NT50 -> NT64 NT24\n- NT65 -> 't56'\n- NT24 -> 't91', etc.\n\nWait, so some non-terminals directly map to 't's. For example, NT65->'t56', so that's how 't56' comes into the string. Similarly, NT13->'t50' explains the 't50's in the string.\n\nBut how do these tokens come together? The string starts with t13, then t56, t35, t24, t24, t13, t15, etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals can be combined to form other non-terminals. For example, NT24 can go to 't24' or be split into NT10 and NT57. Let me check which NT's derive 't24' directly. The productions for 't24' come from NT24 itself both directly and through other paths.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules for NT24:\n\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n\nSo one of the direct derivations is 't24' from NT24. That means that at some point, in the derivation, a NT24 can produce 't24' directly. \n\nLooking at the string, there are multiple 't24's, so the derivation must include NT24 expanding to 't24' each time. \n\nBut looking further, the string starts with t13. So the first token is from NT13. Let's see what NT13 is. The production for NT13 is: NT13 -> 't50'. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext is t56. Looking for NT56... Looking through the grammar, I see NT65 -> 't56'. So maybe the NT is NT65? Wait, no, the production is NT65->'t56', so that's a direct derivation. So the second token, t56, comes from NT65. But NT65 is a non-terminal, so how does that fit into the overall structure.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t13, which comes from NT13, then t56 comes from NT65. But how are these connected? The first two tokens are 't13 t56', so that would mean NT13 followed by NT65... but in the grammar, NT13 is a terminal, so it doesn't produce anything else. So maybe NT13 is not connected directly to NT65 in the string. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is supposed to be built using the grammar's productions, meaning the tokens must be derived in a way that each step builds upon the previous one. Let me try to break down the string into parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string from left to right, trying to match each 't' token to a non-terminal production.\n\nLet me write down the string again for clarity:\n\nt13 t56 t35 t24 t24 t13 t15 t48 t97 t90 t16 t71 t11 t51 t30 t56 t18 t51 t16 t24 t63 t18 t24 t71 t18 t33 t48\n\nThis looks like a sequence of 30 tokens. Each token is a terminal. So, to generate this string, each terminal must be derived from corresponding non-terminals via the grammar's productions.\n\nFirst, t13 is directly from NT13.\n\nThen t56 comes from NT65->'t56'.\n\nSo after t13 comes t56, meaning the production after NT13 must produce NT65? But NT13 is a terminal, it cannot produce anything else. So that seems odd. Unless the string is supposed to start with NT13->t13, then from that, somehow derive NT65, but this seems impossible because NT13 cannot be a non-terminal in the derivation. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a linear sequence of terminals. So each terminal is a step in the derivation.\n\nWait, so actually, the entire string is a single sentence in the language. So, the grammar must derive the entire string as a single word.\n\nThus, the starting symbol S must derive to the entire string, which is a sequence of terminals, so S -> NT29 NT21 (from the first production).\n\nSo the derivation would start with S = NT29 NT21.\n\nFirst, NT29 must produce t48, because NT29->'t48'.\n\nThen NT21->'t18' because NT21->'t18' directly.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be t48 t18. But the string starts with t13 t56, so that doesn't align. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to see if the entire string can be generated step by step by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string as a sequence of steps. Let's try to split the string into parts that could come from the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is a concatenation of several 't' terms, each coming from a production path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built by the non-terminals expanding into a series of terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to see how each token can come from non-terminals via multiple steps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of productions, so I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the grammar and the string I need to evaluate. The grammar consists of a series of productions (rules) where each non-terminal (NT) is expanded into two other non-terminals, except for the terminals (t followed by numbers), which are the leaves and don't expand further. The string to check is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t63 t13 t73 t15 t93 t71 t97 t51 t63 t56 t18 t71 t33 t63 t73 t93 t49 t56 t72 t30 t50 t97 t20 t80 t97 t15 t73`.\n\nMy initial thought is that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT, except for the base cases which produce terminals. This suggests that the corresponding parse trees should have all internal nodes with exactly two children, and all leaves are terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I can represent it as a list of tokens: ['t63', 't13', 't73', 't15', 't93', 't71', 't97', 't51', 't63', 't56', 't18', 't71', 't33', 't63', 't73', 't93', 't49', 't56', 't72', 't30', 't50', 't97', 't20', 't80', 't97', 't15', 't73'].\n\nI need to find a parse tree that can produce this string by starting from the start symbol S and applying productions step by step until I reach the string.\n\nBut going through this manually would be quite time-consuming because the string is 27 tokens long. Maybe I can look for the structure in the string and see if I can find where certain productions are used.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT52 and NT59 both produce t50 and t26, respectively. Wait, let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking back: NT59 \u2192 t0, but more specifically, some of the productions for NT59:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, for example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58, which when expanded further would produce terminals. But in the string, I see some t50's and t97's, which are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for where the string starts and ends with certain tokens to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reconstruct the parse tree by looking for the first symbol and seeing which NT can produce it.\n\nThe first symbol is t63. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t63? Let me scan through the rules:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT13 -> 't50' \u2192 but that's t50, not t63.\n- NT1 -> some t's, but in the rules, NT1's rules produce t73, t13, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT36 -> 't20'\nSo that production would yield t87 t20. But in our string, the first token is t63.\n\nLooking further, there's NT24 -> 't24', which is a terminal, and other NTs produce t's like t18, t20, t23, etc.\n\nWait, looking for t63, let's see which NTs produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions that result in t63 are:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT65 -> 't56'\n- NT63: Wait, in thegrammar, NT15-> 't73', etc., but I don't see any NT that directly produces t63 except maybe the rules. Wait, no, perhaps I'm looking it wrong. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any production where an NT is directly expanded into t63. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking at all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT26 -> 't13'\n- NT20 -> 't18' and 't72'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't48' and 't60'\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n- NT63: Wait, no, I don't see any NT directly producing t63. Hmm, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the string is t63 t13 t73 t15... So the first token is t63. Since in the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t63, perhaps there's an error in the approach.\n\nWait, no. Looking again:\n\nWait, let me check for any NT that can produce t63. Let me go through all the NT productions:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21: So S is two NTs, each can produce parts.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for where the string starts with t63. So the first step is: which NT can produce t63?\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only NT that directly expands into a terminal tX is for some of them. Wait, for example, NT26 \u2192 't13'? Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38. Oh, but NT26 can also be expanded into 't13' if it's a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n\nBut in the rules, are any of these NTs producing a terminal? Yes, in some other productions:\n\nLooking at:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n- NT23 (I don't see that in the given productions but earlier lines)\nWait, perhaps I should check each rule for terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't73'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT70 \u2192 't87' and 't20'\n- NT57 \u2192 't68' and 't2'\n- NT41 \u2192 't2' and 't36'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15' and 't33'\n- NT59 \u2192 't0' and 't58'? Wait, no. Looking at the first few productions, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse engineer the parse: the string is 27 tokens, which is 27 symbols. Each step in the parse corresponds to adding two tokens or splitting a node into two children. Since it's a binary tree, the number of symbols should correspond to 2n - 1, where n is the number of leaves. Wait, let me see: if the string has 27 symbols, could it be generated by a grammar? The number of symbols in a parse tree for a grammar in CNF starts as the root (2 symbols), then each step adds one more token because each production can split a node into two, increasing the number of symbols by one each time until the leaves are reached.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently: to produce a string of m tokens, the number of symbols must satisfy m = 2^k - 1 for some k. So for m=27, is there a k where 2^k -1=27? 2^5=32, 32-1=31, which is more than 27. 2^4=16, 16-1=15, which is less. So 27 is not possible. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but that's only for a string generated by a single path. However, since the grammar may have multiple non-terminals, perhaps the string can be formed by combining different subtrees. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe this indicates that the string can't be generated.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake. Let me calculate 2^5=32, 32-1=31. So 27 isn't of the form 2^k -1. So perhaps that suggests it's not possible? If the number of symbols in the string is not one less than a power of two, then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So if 27 isn't equal to 2^k -1 for any k, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, yes, 2^5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except possibly for the start symbol which can have zero, one, or two terminals.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals that eventually become terminals representing letters in the alphabet, specifically 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers and other 't's, like 't93 t60 t91 t73 ...'. None of these seem to have variables in the string, which means if the grammar can derive a string entirely of terminals without any non-terminals, it should match.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the string must be broken down such that NT29 and NT21 both derive to sequences of terminals that, when concatenated, form the entire string.\n\nI'll need to trace the derivation step by step, making sure that each non-terminal correctly expands into the right sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me start by breaking down NT29 and NT21.\n\nFrom NT29:\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nThen NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT8\nNT5 \u2192 NT93\nWait, the grammar doesn't have NT93, but looking back, the end symbols include 't93' which is the terminal itself. So, perhaps NT5 \u2192 't93'. Wait, in the given grammar, I see NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and then NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT8. But looking at the terminals, there's 't93' which might be from NT5.\n\nWait, let me check: NT5 is defined as NT5 \u2192 't93' because I see the production NT5->'t93'. So when NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT0\u2192NT5 NT8, then NT5 is 't93'. Similarly, NT8 must resolve to 't60' because looking at the string, the first term is t93, then t60.\n\nSo, NT8 \u2192 't60'.\n\nThus, NT0 resolves to 't93 t60'.\n\nNow, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 't93 t60' followed by NT58.\n\nLooking at NT58, it's a non-terminal that produces NT28 NT60.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, and NT37 \u2192 't2'; NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37 \u2192 't56 t2' (since NT65 \u2192 't56'). So NT28 resolves to 't2 t56'.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't2 t56', and then NT28 leads to NT60 in NT58, so NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT60 \u2192 't2 t56 t60' ?\n\nWait, no, wait: NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT60. So NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72 (since NT28 is a terminal? Wait no: from the given grammar, looking at the production, NT28 has a production: NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, but I'm trying to find terminal symbols. Wait, looking back: in the grammar, NT37 is a non-terminal that produces 't2', and NT72 is 't56' because NT37 \u2192 't2' and NT72 is 't56'? Wait wait: looking at the grammar, I see several entries:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT37 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT65 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, and NT37 is 't2', NT72 is 't56' (since NT72 \u2192 't56'; from NT72's production: NT65 \u2192 't56'; wait, no. Let me check NT72. Looking at the grammar, I see NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37. Then NT65 \u2192 't56', and NT37 is 't2'. So NT72 \u2192 't56 t2', but wait, that's a non-terminal chain. Wait, no, because in the string, some of these are terminals. Let me look at the production for NT28:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking up the productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72.\n\nNT37 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, but NT65 is another non-terminal in the grammar which has its own production.\n\nWait, for NT65:\n\nNT65 \u2192 't56'\n\nBecause NT65 is a non-terminal but in the grammar, I see NT50 \u2192 't71', but looking at NT65, is there a production that leads to a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT65 -> ...? Let me see: Yes, there is NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46, but that's a two-step production. Wait no, checking:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines:\n\nNT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\n\nBut wait, let me look for NT65. There is \"NT65 -> NT50 NT46\" but that's in another part. Wait, no, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait no, the grammar provided has:\n\nNT59 -> 't0' ?? Let me check: Yes, looking back:\n\nI think I might have misread some of the productions. Let me parse each line carefully.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT8\n\nNT5 \u2192 't93'\n\nSo NT5 is 't93', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let's see about NT72:\n\nLooking for NT72's production: It's in the lines:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n\nThen NT65: looking through the lines, \"NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46\"\n\nAnd NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\n\nWait, but NT39 is another production: \"NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62\"\n\nWait, this seems like a loop. Let me try to find any NT that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34 \u2192 ... ?\n\nMaybe an alternative approach: Let's parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: 't93 t60 t91 t73 t24 t16 t24 t87 t71 t2 t80 t18 t23 t16 t72 t18 t90 t56 t60 t11 t80 t30 t60 t48 t48 t56 t16 t87'\n\nSince S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and the string starts with 't93 t60', which is the beginning of NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, so S is NT29 NT21, which produces 't93 t60' and then the rest comes from NT21.\n\nLet me see NT21:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n\nWait, that seems circular. Let me see the productions:\n\nLooking for NT34:\n\nIt says NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n\nBut NT64 is in another production: Let's see, NT64 \u2192 't59'?\n\nWait, looking for NT64: \"NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37\"\n\nAnd NT64 \u2192 't48' is another production: \"NT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10\"\n\nWait, no. Let me check each line again.\n\nWait, the lines given are:\n\nIn the grammar, the production for NT64 is \"NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37\".\n\nAdditionally, NT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps I need to list the productions leading to terminal steps.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals are marked with 't...', so for example, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58; NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT8; NT5 \u2192 't93'; NT8 \u2192 't60'.\n\nWait, so for NT0, it's NT5 and NT8, both of which produce 't93' and 't60', respectively.\n\nSo NT0 \u2192 't93' 't60'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT60.\n\nWait NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72.\n\nSo NT28 is \"t2 t56\" (since NT37 is 't2' and NT72 is 't56').\n\nSo NT28 \u2192 't2 t56'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-484","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, most of the rules do seem to fit this format\u2014each non-terminal on the left is rewritten into two other non-terminals or a terminal. So, I think I can work with this.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t50 t24 t24 t13 t60 t15 t49 t30 t24 t35 t50 t97 t51 t49 t50 t80 t11 t2 t80 t80 t33 t23 t50 t30 t20 t97 t60 t51.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal, or two terminals). So, for the string to be generated, it must be possible to parse it by applying these productions in reverse\u2014meaning starting from the start symbol and generating the string through successive expansions.\n\nLet's look at the start symbol. In the given grammar, the start symbol is S. According to the first production, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first step is to generate the start symbol S by expanding it into NT29 and NT21. Now, the string I have starts with t50, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this from the string's perspective. Maybe I need to parse the string into the right symbols and see if I can derive it using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's list out the string's tokens:\n\n[1] t50\n[2] t24\n[3] t24\n[4] t13\n[5] t60\n[6] t15\n[7] t49\n[8] t30\n[9] t24\n[10] t35\n[11] t50\n[12] t97\n[13] t51\n[14] t49\n[15] t50\n[16] t80\n[17] t11\n[18] t2\n[19] t80\n[20] t80\n[21] t33\n[22] t23\n[23] t50\n[24] t30\n[25] t20\n[26] t97\n[27] t60\n[28] t51\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So, the string must start with NT29 and NT21 expanding into the tokens. Looking at the string's first token, it's t50. Looking in the grammar, where does t50 come from? I see rules like:\n\n- NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT50 \u2192 t19\n\nWait, no, actually looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake because in the provided grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo, NT24 can produce a 't24' token. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT50 produce specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals in the grammar. Let's go through the productions:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT13 \u2192 't50'\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT51 \u2192 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't80'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT41 \u2192 't16'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13' (Wait, that's 't13')\n- NT59 \u2192 't0' (t93?) Wait, let's clarify:\n\nLooking closely, the grammar has a list of rules. For example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo, NT24 can produce 't24'. Then, looking for where 't24' appears in the string, it's the second token.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't13', so somewhere we have 't13' in the string.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating myself. Maybe a better approach is to use a parsing strategy, like leftmost derivation. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use recursive descent or a stack-based approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent the grammar as a tree and see if the string can be generated by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to parse the entire string, I can check if each token in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar, but that might not be sufficient because the order of the non-terminals matters based on the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into segments that match the non-terminals' productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, so each step in the derivation produces two symbols. However, since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps, starting from the start symbol which produces two non-terminals. But our string has 28 tokens. Let's check: 2^5 = 32, which is more than 28. 2^4=16, which is less. So it doesn't fit, meaning it's impossible because the number of symbols should be a power of 2. Wait, but starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21 (2 symbols), then each step would double the number. So, in k steps, we would have 2^(k+1) symbols. So, 28 is not a power of 2. Hmm, that might mean it's not possible. For example:\n\nStart: 1 symbol (S)\nAfter 1 step: 2 symbols (NT29, NT21)\nAfter 2 steps: each can split into 2, so 4 symbols\nAfter 3 steps: 8\nAfter 4: 16\nAfter 5:32\nSo 28 doesn't fit, meaning the string can't be derived from S because the number of symbols isn't a power of two.\n\nWait, but the string has 28 symbols. 2^5 is 32, which is more than 28. So, unless it's a different derivation where some non-terminals produce terminals without splitting further, but in CNF, each rule is exactly two symbols. So even if a non-terminal is a terminal, you can't have any further splitting\u2014it just contributes one token. Hmm, actually, in CNF, a production can be a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. So, for example, if a non-terminal A produces a terminal a and another non-terminal B, then when you expand A, it produces a and B. So, in that case, it's like you're adding a terminal at the start and two non-terminals, but the terminal is not split further. Similarly, two terminals would just produce two tokens.\n\nWait, so perhaps the total number of tokens can vary based on how many non-terminals split into terminals.\n\nLet me test this idea. Starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Each of these could be expanded:\n\n- NT29: If it produces two non-terminals, then each step increases the count by one. But if NT29 produces a terminal and a non-terminal, then expanding that non-terminal further might add to the count.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the possible number of tokens generated. Let's think about possible minimum and maximum number of tokens.\n\nMinimum: Each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals (so two more to expand) or a terminal (adding one to the count). So minimum tokens when all non-terminals produce two terminals (like NT24 \u2192 't24')\u2014so each S \u2192 NT29 NT21, each NT29 and NT21 produce one terminal. So total tokens would be 2.\n\nBut the string has 28 tokens, so that's a lot more. Maybe through some combination of non-terminals that produce more tokens. Wait, but each step can generate an increase by one token if a non-terminal produces a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the possible range. Each production that splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals can increase the number of symbols. Those that split into terminals don't, but they can contribute a fixed number of tokens.\n\nThis might get complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-503","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t18 t15 t63 t97 t49 t63 t63 t35 t73 t18 t51 t33 t56 t71 t97 t60 t35 t33 t97 t56 t93 t60 t24 t93 t90 t71 t93 t90 t50`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a single terminal, or a pair of non-terminals. So the grammar doesn't have any \u03b5-productions or terminals on the left side, but wait\u2014actually, it does. Looking at the grammar, I see some non-terminals leading to terminals, like `NT52 -> 't97'` and others. So most non-terminals produce two terminals or another non-terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers, like 't18', 't15', etc. I need to see if these can be generated by the grammar. \n\nLet me list the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, each non-terminal on the left is either producing a terminal and another non-terminal, or two non-terminals. For example, `S -> NT29 NT21`. So each production is either a terminal followed by a non-terminal, a non-terminal followed by a terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nTo generate a string, the grammar would derive a sequence of terminals from the start symbol S. The string given is quite long, so I should think about how each part of the string is constructed.\n\nI notice that some of the non-terminals directly lead to a single 't' followed by a number. For instance, `NT1 -> 't73'`, `NT52 -> 't97'`, etc. These are leaf nodes in the parse tree and represent the base of any recursively generated string.\n\nNow, let's analyze the string:\n\nThe first part is `t18 t15`. Looking at the grammar, `NT20 -> 't18'`, and `NT15 -> 't15'`. So to get `t18 t15`, the production must be `NT20 NT15`. Checking the grammar, `NT20 -> NT2 NT55`, and `NT15 -> NT71 NT68`. Then, `NT71 -> 't10'` and `NT68 -> 't30'`. So `NT15` becomes `t10 t30`, but in the string, it's `t15`. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. \n\nWait, looking again, `NT15` isn't directly a terminal. It's `NT71 NT68`. `NT71` is `'t10'`, `NT68` is `'t30'`. So `NT15` would expand to `t10 t30`, but in the string, it's just `t15`. That suggests a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of tokens; perhaps each token corresponds to a non-terminal expansion, which can produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the string is a sequence of symbols, both terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, it's all terminals. But in the grammar, only the right-hand sides of non-terminals are either terminals or non-terminals. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal, or a non-terminal and a terminal, or a terminal directly.\n\nBut the string given is a linear sequence of terminals (like 't18', 't15', etc.). So the derivation must produce these in order. This suggests that the entire string must be derived from the start symbol S, expanding non-terminals recursively and eliminating them into terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, to derive the string, starting from S, each non-terminal must be expanded through a series of productions, eventually producing the required terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't18'. So, the start symbol S must be expanded into non-terminals that eventually derive to 't18'. Let's see what S expands to: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S is NT29 followed by NT21. So both NT29 and NT21 must expand to a sequence that produces the corresponding part of the string.\n\nThe string after the start is t18 t15 t63 ... So, looking at the first part, 't18' t15. Wait, no, the string is t18 t15 t63 t97... which is the entire sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I should break down the entire string step by step. But that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for non-terminals that directly produce certain terminal strings. For example, checking each 't...':\n\n- 't18' comes from NT20, which is 't18'. So, when NT20 is expanded, it should directly give 't18'. But NT20 is defined as 't18' via which rule? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see `NT20 -> NT2 NT55`. Then, NT2 -> 't5' and so on, but in the string, it's 't18'. So maybe I'm confused about that. Wait, in the rules, is there any NT that directly gives 't18'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT20 -> NT2 NT55, NT29 -> NT48, and in terminals, I see NT19 -> 't15', NT68 -> 't30', NT52 -> 't97', etc. Wait, is there any non-terminal that directly produces 't18'? Let me check each rule's right-hand side where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production where a single non-terminal on the left is directly tied to a terminal that starts with t18. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me go through each rule line by line to check for terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- S: NT29 NT21\n- NT47: NT59 NT15\n- NT26: NT24 NT72, etc.\n- NT1: NT70 NT47\nWait, I'm looking for any rule where the right-hand side is just a single terminal. For example, NT52 -> 't97' and others. But I don't see any non-terminal directly expanding to 't18' or 't15' without intermediate steps.\n\nSo, to get 't18' as part of the string, the NT must expand into 't18' through a series of productions. But looking at NT20: NT20 is 't18' because it's defined as that? Or wait, is NT20 a production that leads into 't18'? Let me check:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55, and NT2 is 't5 NT60', which produces t5 followed by another NT, which seems to lead into more productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to find a path from NT20 to 't18'. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55.\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5' NT60.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT15 NT65.\n\nWait, NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68.\n\nNT71 \u2192 't10', NT68 \u2192 't30'. So NT15 \u2192 't10 t30'.\n\nThen, NT55 \u2192 NT15 NT65.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72.\n\nNT37 \u2192 't2', NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nThis seems like a loop: NT37 is t2 and NT72 \u2192 NT65 and NT37.\n\nBut I can't see NT20 leading directly to 't18'. Maybe I missed a rule where NT20 is a terminal, but looking through all the rules, I don't see any such production, except through non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT20 is not a terminal, but a non-terminal that must lead into other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal.\n\nBut in that case, starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and then each of those must expand into sequences of non-terminals leading to terminals. So to get 't18' as the first symbol, that would mean the first NT must expand into 't18' somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several short sequences, like 't18 t15' being the first part, but I'm not sure if that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding what I'm dealing with. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t30 t35 t13 t30 t90 t93 t33 t49 t51 t72 t11 t91 t2 t35 t18 t13 t16 t16 t35 t15 t80 t90 t93 t30 t50 t50 t56 t24 t33`.\n\nI notice all the elements are in lowercase like 't', followed by numbers.

Oh, wait, NT58 in another rule is NT58 \u2192 t20. But we have t30.\n\nWait, let me check all rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT65 \u2192 t56\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT23 \u2192 t49\n- NT91 \u2192 t91\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT35 \u2192 t35 (Actually, in the list, it's NT19 \u2192 t90, but looking back, I think I misread it.

But looking for terminals like t30, I see NT20 \u2192 t18 and NT20 \u2192 t72. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, but I don't see any terminal t28. Hmm, perhaps t30 comes from another rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which NTs produce t30. Let me check each NT rule:\n\nLooking through the rules, let me scan for 't30' as a production. I don't see any NT directly producing t30 in their rules. So perhaps t30 is produced by a chain of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each rule again:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18, t72\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT1 \u2192 't70', but wait, in the list, it's NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, and NT70 \u2192 t51... but that's not relevant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a rule. Let me check all the NT rules again carefully:\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18, t72\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\nOh! Wait, I think I found one: NT68 \u2192 t30.\n\nYes, the rule says NT68 \u2192 t30. So that's a direct production. Okay, so one of the NTs is NT68.\n\nSo then, to have t30 in the string, the corresponding NT must produce t30. So, for example, if the NT68 appears in the derivation, it would produce t30.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, I need to find if NT68 can be derived from S or from other NTs.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo S is split into two parts: NT29 and NT21. So the string is split into two parts as well. But the string is a single sequence, so I think this grammar might produce strings by combining two separate derivations, but since it's S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the entire string must be the concatenation of the two parts.\n\nWait, but the string has 35 tokens. Each part from S is a string of symbols. Since S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the entire string would be the concatenation of the derivations of NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be split into two parts where the first part is derived from NT29 and the second from NT21, concatenated together.\n\nWait, let me see: the string has t30 at the third position, but let me check where the split would be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is derived into two parts, each of which can be a string of NTs and terminals, and then concatenated. So the entire string must be equal to the concatenation of the two derivations.\n\nWait, for example, the entire string is 35 tokens. Let's assume that the first part, derived from NT29, has, say, n tokens, and the second from NT21 has 35 - n tokens. So we need to see if both parts can be derived.\n\nWait, but this would be a lot of possibilities. Maybe a better approach would be to see how the string can be built step by step following the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by checking each token and seeing if it can be matched by any production rule.\n\nLet me look at the string token by token and see if I can derive it step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt30 t35 t13 t30 t90 t93 t33 t49 t51 t72 t11 t91 t2 t35 t18 t13 t16 t16 t35 t15 t80 t90 t93 t30 t50 t50 t56 t24 t33\n\nFirst token: t30. From the rules, I see that NT68 \u2192 t30. So the first part must be derived from NT68.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so perhaps the first part comes from NT29, or maybe it's part of a larger NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to split S into NT29 and NT21 and see if each can produce the corresponding part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is generated by a single NT.\n\nWait, let me see if the entire string can be produced by any NT.\n\nLooking for the starting point: the string starts with t30, which is from NT68. So perhaps the root is NT68. But the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT21. Hmm, confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be derived from S, so each token in the string must come from either NT29 or NT21 through a series of productions. But it's the concatenation of the two, so each part is derived separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built by substituting the NTs in S step by step. Let's try to see.\n\nAnother approach: since S decomposes into NT29 NT21, each step would involve expanding these NTs into sequences of NTs and terminals.\n\nBut tracing this for a string of 35 tokens would be too lengthy. Maybe I can find if the string can be split at S into two parts: the first part from NT29 and the second from NT21.\n\nSo let me see: the string has 35 tokens. Suppose the first k tokens are from NT29, and the remaining 35 - k tokens from NT21. Let's see if we can find such a split.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\n- t30, t35, t13, t30, t90, t93, t33, t49, t51, t72,...\n\nI know that t30 comes from NT68. Let's see where else do NTs that produce t30 appear.\n\nWait, I see another production: NT58 \u2192 t20, which isn't helpful. Hmm, but in the list, I find that NT68 \u2192 t30, so perhaps the first part is ND68, which is part of NT29.\n\nWait, let's check the production for NT29.

Since the grammar is given in CNF, I can use a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly expands to NT29 NT21.

So, perhaps NT29 can only be derived from NT33.\n\nWait, but without a direct production for NT29, maybe NT29 can't be derived on its own, but only as part of another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the initial rules.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t11 t93 t33 t91 t33 t11 t30 t11 t24 t90 t48 t49 t93 t80 t91 t48 t16 t56 t93 t60 t24 t73 t48 t90 t33 t63 t48 t87 t93 t48`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production is either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most productions are of the form NT followed by another NT, except for some that produce terminals. Each of these terminals represents a specific character or token. My task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the string starts with NT29 producing t29, but wait, looking at the string, the first token is t11, not t29. That seems confusing. But wait, perhaps NT29 can produce 't29'? No, looking at the grammar, NT29 seems to be a non-terminal. Checking the productions, I don't see NT29 as a production. The closest is NT29 \u2192 NT48, but then NT48 \u2192 NT34, which then goes to NT64, which then becomes t48. Hmm, so maybe NT29 can eventually produce 't29' through a series of productions.\n\nWait, let me go through this step by step. The string starts with t11, then t93, t33, etc. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So the string should be a sequence of symbols from S, which must derive to the given tokens.\n\nEach non-terminal in the string must be generated by the grammar's productions. Let me map each token to see which non-terminal can produce it.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string:\n\nt11: Checking the grammar, does any NT produce t11? Yes, NT36 \u2192 t20, and NT51 \u2192 t87, NT71 \u2192 t90, NT19 \u2192 t33, NT68 \u2192 t30, NT62 \u2192 t1, NT33 \u2192 t33 (itself?), but wait, the grammar says NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34. And from NT29 and NT34, we saw NT29 becomes NT48, which becomes NT34, which becomes NT64, which becomes t48. Wait, but t11 is another terminal. Hmm.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some NTs produce terminals. Let me list which NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT50 \u2192 t71 (wait, NT50 is given as \u2192 t71, but in the grammar, it's shown as NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t48 (but wait, NT34 also produces other things like \u2192 NT64 NT55)\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the notation. The NT's are written as NT followed by a number, like NT29, NT47, etc. Each of these can either produce two NTs or a terminal.\n\nSo, for each NT:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t48, but also has other productions\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT65 \u2192 t56\n- NT5 \u2192 t93 (same as above)\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT58 \u2192 t20?

Wait, no, looking at the grammar, one of the productions is NT0 \u2192 't93'. So NT0 produces t93.\n\nWait, but let me make a list of which NTs directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT0 \u2192 t93\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT19 \u2192 t33\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT73 \u2192 t73 (is this a terminal? No, because the grammar has NT73, but looking through, NT73 is not a terminal. It's used in production NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, where NT70 \u2192 t51 NT36, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this step by step. The string is a sequence of terminals, but each step in the derivation must follow the grammar. So starting from S, we need to see if the string can be built.\n\nEach token in the string must come from one of the NTs that produce a terminal. Let's see which NTs in the grammar produce terminals:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21: Both are NTs, so the string starts with two NTs. The first token is 't11', which must be either NT29 or NT21. Let's check what they can produce.\n\n2. NT29 \u2192 NT48 (from production NT29 \u2192 NT48)\n   NT48 \u2192 NT34 (from NT48 \u2192 NT34)\n   NT34 \u2192 either NT64 NT55 or t80 (Wait, looking at the productions: NT34 has two options: \u2192 NT64 NT55 or \u2192 t80)\n   Wait, so NT34 can produce t80 directly or split further.\n\nIf the first token is t11, but looking through the NTs, none of them start directly as t11. So perhaps the first step is wrong. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go step by step.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So each of these NTs must eventually produce a term that matches the string.\n\nThe string starts with t11, which is the first token. So either NT29 or NT21 must produce 't11'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which NTs produce 't11'? Scanning through the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t11 except if any NT's production ends in t11.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT34 \u2192 t80 or NT64 NT55\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT19 \u2192 t33\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT73 \u2192 t73 (but perhaps not relevant)\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT65 \u2192 t56\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18 or t72 or t2 (Wait, NT20's production is NT2 \u2192 NT55, but earlier I saw the NT20 production is ambiguous.)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-540","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by it. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals except for the terminals. The start symbol is S, and I need to see if the given string t50 t48...t97 comes from S through a series of these productions.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string from left to right, looking for possible non-terminals that can derive into the next few tokens. The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token might correspond to a terminal production from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are terminals once they have certain productions. For example, NT52 -> 't97', and NT13 -> 't50', etc. So, wherever I see a non-terminal that produces a single terminal, I can replace it with that terminal.\n\nLet me break down the approach:\n\n1. Start from the first symbol in the string and see which non-terminal can produce it.\n2. For each step, look for a non-terminal (possibly after some reductions) that can match a part of the string.\n3. After parsing the entire string, check if it's completely consumed.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a CNF grammar, I can use the CYK algorithm or attempt a recursive descent approach. Maybe writing a parser step by step will help.\n\nLooking at the string: t50 t48 t50 t30 t49 t73 t90 t71 t56 etc.\n\nLooking for the first part. What non-terminals can produce t50? Looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT productions that end in a terminal sequence that starts with t50.\n\nLooking at NT50: NT50 -> NT71 NT64. Hmm, but those are non-terminals. Do any of these NT productions produce t50?\n\nLooking for NT with a production ending in t50.\n\nLooking across the grammar:\n\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37 (non-terminals)\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34 (non-terminals)\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47 (non-terminals)\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36 (non-terminals)\n- NT57 -> NT68 NT2 (non-terminals)\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28 (non-terminals)\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34; and so on.\n\nWait, but in the productions, NT13 -> 't50' is one of them. So NT13 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't50'. But looking at the grammar, I see NT13 is used in a production: S seems to go through some NT64, but perhaps NT21 -> NT55 NT52, and NT52 -> 't97'. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT13 is only used once: NT13 -> 't50'.\n\nSo, t50 in the string could come from NT13. So the first part is t50 --> NT13.\n\nNow, after NT13, the next symbol is t48. So after NT13, the following non-terminals should produce NT13's next part.\n\nBut in this case, the production is direct: NT13 -> 't50', so after consuming 't50', the next symbol should be the next in the string.\n\nSo the string after t50 is t48 t50..., which would mean after t50 (NT13), the next is t48, so we need to see what NT13's production implies next. But since NT13's production is a single terminal 't50', after it, the next non-terminal would start deriving the rest.\n\nWait, maybe a different approach: since the grammar is CNF, it's leftmost derivation. So I should start with S and try to derive the string.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so perhaps I can segment it into parts that match the terminals produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking for possible derivations step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with t50. That's 't50' which is produced by NT13. So S must start with NT13's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is S -> NT29 NT21 or NT26...? Wait, wait the start symbol is S, and the given grammar is that S-> NT29 NT21? Wait, I think the user wrote the grammar as some lines. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar is S -> NT29 NT21, and then other productions. So S produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo the first two symbols in any derivation will be the first two symbols of NT29's expansion followed by NT21's expansion, or vice versa? Wait, no, in leftmost derivation, S first produces NT29 and NT21, so the first two symbols of the string would be the first symbols of NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo t50 is 't50' which is NT13, so S can't be directly producing t50 because S produces NT29 and NT21. So perhaps S must produce NT29 and NT21, each leading into certain terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, first comes 't50', which would have to come from a derivation of S leading to NT13, but S itself goes through NT29 and NT21. So, perhaps this is impossible. Because S directly goes to NT29 and NT21, so the first token in the string would have to be the first symbol of NT29's expansion or NT21's expansion.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is 't50', so maybe t50 must come directly from NT29 or NT21.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT29: Do any NT29 productions exist?\n\nLooking through the grammar entries, it seems that NT29 is not a terminal, but a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the production list, I don't see NT29 as a terminal. The terminal symbols are like t50, t97, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the terminal symbols in the grammar: They include t50, t48, t50, t30, t49, t73, t90, etc., but the non-terminals are all NT followed by numbers, like NT13, NT1, etc.\n\nWait, in the list, are those NT's and t's separate? Like, the terminals are t50, t48, etc., and the non-terminals are like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nWait, I think that the grammar is mixing both, but I'll proceed carefully.\n\nSo, in the string, 't50' is a terminal, but in the grammar, the only production that directly produces a 't50' is NT13 -> 't50'. So in any derivation, 't50' must come from NT13.\n\nBut S starts with NT29 and NT21. So unless NT29 or NT21 derive into a terminal 't50', the string can't start with 't50'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT29: Do any? I don't think so. Because in the grammar, NT29 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal. Maybe NT29's productions go to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar again. The first few lines are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\n\nNT46 -> NT2 NT10\n\nWait, that's all the productions for certain NTs. So for NT29: I don't see any NT29 production in the given grammar. It seems that NT29 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal. Same with NT21, NT47, etc.\n\nSo the only way 't50' can appear is if it's produced by NT13, but NT13 is not derived from S because S produces NT29 and NT21, so how do we get 't50' at the start?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe S directly produces 't50' somehow? But no, the production is S-> NT29 NT21, which are non-terminals.\n\nSo unless NT29 or NT21 can derive into 't50', the first symbol can't be 't50'. Therefore, maybe the string can't be produced by this grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-562","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Alright, let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain analyses easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that the non-terminals are represented with the prefix 'NT' followed by a number, like NT2, NT3, etc. The terminals are just the 't' followed by a number, such as t35, t50, etc. The start symbol is S, which eventually needs to derive the empty string through a series of productions.\n\nThe string I need to test is: `t35 t33 t73 t50 t24 t35 t49 t80 t80 t18 t48 t93 t30 t97 t91 t35 t50 t50 t20 t73 t18 t73 t93 t63 t24 t16 t49 t35 t50 t11 t63 t35`. \n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. Each token (either a 't' followed by a number or a non-terminal) should be matched step by step through the productions.\n\nLet me start by listing all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals might lead to them. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are directly connected to terminals. For example:\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- And so on.\n\nI can create a mapping from non-terminals to their corresponding terminals where applicable. This might help me trace back from the string to the start symbol.\n\nNext, I'll try to parse the string by looking for these terminals and seeing if they can be generated by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string into individual terminals:\n\n1. t35\n2. t33\n3. t73\n4. t50\n5. t24\n6. t35\n7. t49\n8. t80\n9. t80\n10. t18\n11. t48\n12. t93\n13. t30\n14. t97\n15. t91\n16. t35\n17. t50\n18. t50\n19. t20\n20. t73\n21. t18\n22. t73\n23. t93\n24. t63\n25. t24\n26. t16\n27. t49\n28. t35\n29. t50\n30. t11\n31. t63\n32. t35\n\nNow, I'll try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step. Starting from the left, let's see how we can generate these terminals.\n\nStarting with the first part: t35. From the grammar, I see that NT38 \u2192 t35 and NT39 \u2192 t80. Let me check if NT38 is present.\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, NT38 is defined as NT46 NT59. Also, NT38 \u2192 t35. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, the production for NT38 is: NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34. Hmm, that's more complex. Then when does a terminal appear?\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n- NT64 is defined as NT59 NT37, and NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, NT57 is NT68 NT2, etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. I might need to look for non-terminals that directly produce the terminals I have.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT50 \u2192 't71' and others\n- Wait, NT41 \u2192 t16\n- Let me go through each NT:\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n1. NT26 \u2192 t13\n2. NT20 \u2192 t18\n3. NT24 \u2192 t24\n4. NT38 \u2192 t35\n5. NT50 \u2192 t71, but also NT51 \u2192 t87, so wait, NT51 \u2192 t87, not t71. So NT50 doesn't produce t71, perhaps it's another NT? Wait, looking for NT50: It's defined as NT50\u2192NT64 NT24, so it doesn't directly produce terminals. But NT33: NT33\u2192t23? Wait, I might have missed some.\n\nWait, looking again at the initial grammar:\n\nLooking for any NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34)\n- NT34 \u2192 t60\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT22? Wait, looking back at the grammar, it doesn\u2019t seem there's an NT22; perhaps I mixed up some numbers.\n\nWait, let me re-examine all the grammar rules:\n\nGoing through the first few:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 NT59 NT52 (Wait, no, NT0 is in another rule.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all NTs and their direct productions:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-563","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal or a single non-terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar to have a clear view. The start symbol is S, and it has the production S -> NT29 NT21. So the string we're testing must eventually derive from this.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t16 t16 t72 t20 t50 t80 t56 t73 t15 t18 t87 t18 t90 t35 t51 t15 t73 t63 t23 t11 t90 t20 t73 t56 t33 t56 t71 t20 t87 t24 t24 t33`.\n\nI notice that all the symbols in the string are terminals because they start with 't' followed by numbers. So, each of these must be derived from non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules produce terminals. For example, NT13 -> 't50' and NT1 -> 't73'. I'll need to see how the given string can be composed of these terminals through the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string has 33 terminal symbols. Let's count them:\n\nt16 (1), t16 (2), t72 (3), t20 (4), t50 (5), t80 (6), t56 (7), t73 (8), t15 (9), t18 (10), t87 (11), t18 (12), t90 (13), t35 (14), t51 (15), t15 (16), t73 (17), t63 (18), t23 (19), t11 (20), t90 (21), t20 (22), t73 (23), t56 (24), t33 (25), t56 (26), t71 (27), t20 (28), t87 (29), t24 (30), t24 (31), t33 (32,33).\n\nSo, 33 terminals, which would require the derivation to start from S and expand 33 steps (each production takes us from S to 2 symbols, but we're counting the depth of derivation). But in Chomsky Normal Form, each step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals, so the number of steps needed to produce N terminals is N-1. So 33 terminals would require at least 32 steps. But the complexity is that each production can further expand those non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I should work backwards using the given rules. Let's see.\n\nThe last symbol is t33. So perhaps the last production is NT33 -> 't33'. But looking at the grammar, NT33 isn't present. Wait, let's check the given grammar again. No, the given grammar has NT33 -> 't23', for example. Wait, in the provided rules, I see NT33 -> 't23'? Let me check again. \n\nLooking through the rules quickly, yes, at the end there's NT33 -> 't23'. Hmm, but wait, in our string, the last symbol is t33. So how does that tie in?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the provided grammar again. The user provided the grammar, but looking back, I see NT33 -> 't23', but in the string, in position 32, we have t33. So that suggests that the last production would be NT33 -> t23, which doesn't match the symbol t33. That might indicate a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. In the grammar, do I see NT33 -> 't33'? Or is it another production. Looking more carefully: the given rules include NT33 -> 't23' and NT39 -> 't80', etc. Wait, I don't see NT33 -> 't33' in the provided rules. So perhaps the last symbol can't be t33. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a typo, but I don't think so here. So perhaps I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps the last symbol is t33, but looking at the rules, I don't see a production NT33 -> 't33' in the given grammar. So maybe the string is invalid because it ends with t33, which can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules provided. Here's a list of the rules:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT33 -> 't23' (yes, line 32: NT33 -> 't23')\n\nSo NT33 can produce t23, not t33. So the string ends with t33, which cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be produced by the grammar.\n\nWait, but is there any way that t33 can be produced indirectly? Maybe from another non-terminal? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the other rules, for example, NT39 -> 't80', NT59-> 't0', etc. Wait, perhaps there's a production that allows NT33 to have more symbols. But according to the given rules, NT33 only produces t23.\n\nSo, the last symbol in the string is t33, which the grammar can't produce because there's no production for NT33 to produce t33. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the string has a t33 somewhere else, but looking at the string provided: yes, the last symbol is t33, but the rule for NT33 only goes to t23.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it ends with t33, which is not produced by any rule in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But since I'm just trying to determine if a specific string is in the language, maybe I can approach this by breaking down the string step by step through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: \n\nt30 t63 t2 t30 t33 t35 t48 t97 t20 t2 t63 t63 t35 t97 t30 t73 t63 t23 t73 t16 t63 t87 t48 t49 t91 t18 t60 t33 t18 t51 t20 t90 t90.\n\nI notice that most of these are terminals (they start with 't'), except some like 'NT47', 'NT26', etc. So I need to see if I can derive this string step by step by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nBut that might take a long time, and the string is over 40 symbols long. Maybe I can find a pattern or look for repeated sequences. However, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either directly produces a terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two symbols, either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. But wait, in CNF, every production is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So the left-hand side (LHS) must have a single non-terminal, right?\n\nWait, no. Chomsky normal form is when each production is A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 X, where X is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014each production can only have one symbol on the RHS, which is either a terminal or a non-terminal, or two non-terminals? No, that's not right. Actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so two non-terminals or one terminal. But when considering parsing, each step consumes or produces two symbols: a single symbol (terminal or non-terminal) won't be the case because you can only expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the LHS is a single non-terminal, and the RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nSo, when generating the string, each step will replace a non-terminal with two symbols. That means the derivation starts with the start symbol and builds up the string by replacing non-terminals with pairs of symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals), until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in the string.\n\nGiven that, the string is constructed in a way that each node in the parse tree would have exactly two children. So, the length of the string should be one more than a power of two, but since it's 40-something, that might not be the case here because the grammar can have multiple layers. Wait, maybe not; perhaps the specific grammar allows for strings of varying lengths, not just powers of two plus one.\n\nBut let me step back. Maybe instead of building the entire parse tree, which seems complicated, I can work backwards from the string, trying to see if it can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't90', which I need to check against any productions ending with a terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't90' is produced by which non-terminals? Let's check the productions where the RHS includes 't90' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, there's: \n\nNT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47 \u2192 produces NT70 and NT47. Then NT70 \u2192 NT51 NT36 \u2192 but looking through all the productions, I don't see any that directly produce 't90' as a terminal. Wait, let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for any production where 't90' is on the RHS. Scanning the productions:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 not present as a production; perhaps I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all terminal symbols first. The terminals in the string are 't30', 't63', 't2', etc. So, let's see which production rules produce these terminals as the RHS.\n\nLooking through the productions, whenever a production ends with a terminal, it's likely that the terminal is the result of a production rule that produces that terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'?\nWait, looking at the given productions:\n\nLooking for any production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking one by one:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT65 \u2192 NT59 NT65\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n- NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n- NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n- NT36 \u2192 NT20 NT28\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47\n- NT70 \u2192 NT51 NT36\n- NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT59 \u2192 NT23 NT41\n- NT6 \u2192 ?\nWait, maybe I can make a list of all terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 a where a is a terminal without further non-terminals.\n\nFrom the given productions, I can see:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT50 NT10 \u2192 Wait, no, NT50 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me process each production line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-581","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals or one non-terminal on the right side, and the string to check must be decomposable according to these rules.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and it's directly rewritten as NT29 NT21. So, S can be replaced by these two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals (NT29 and NT21) can further expand either into two non-terminals or into a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t16 t97 t51 t24 t30 t13 t15 t90 t15 t63 t18 t20 t11 t20 t24 t63 t97 t13 t11 t73 t93 t90 t60 t33 t11 t60 t33 t33 t33 t11 t30 t73 t71`. \n\nNow, I'll try to parse this string from left to right, using the grammar rules. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and the NTs are non-terminals. Let's see if the string can be broken down into a series of productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string should be split into two parts: something corresponding to NT29 and something corresponding to NT21. Let me see how the string starts:\n\nt16 t97 ... So, does this start with NT29?\n\nLooking at the NT29 productions: Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT29 is part of the production for NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT0 is a terminal. Wait, no, actually checking the rules:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58, which is a production, but the string starts with t16, which seems to correspond to NT41, perhaps. Wait, looking at the NT rules, I think I might have to map each part differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to work from the top down. S splits into NT29 and NT21. Let's check what NT29 and NT21 can generate.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: I see NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 is 't93', and NT58 is 't20'. So NT59 can generate 't93 t20'. Also, looking for NT29's rules\u2014wait, I don't see NT29 directly in the productions. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan all the NT rules:\n\n- NT59: NT0 NT58; NT0 is 't93'; NT58 is 't20', so NT59 \u2192 t93 t20.\n- NT5: 't93'.\n- NT24: t24.\n- NT65: t56.\n- NT2: 't73'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree. Let's try to split the string into parts that could correspond to S's two components.\n\nThe string starts with t16. Looking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t16 t something. Because NT41 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, which eventually leads to terminals. Wait, maybe it's better to find productions that start with specific terminals.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see that NT26 -> NT24 NT38, and NT24 is 't24', and NT38 is 't35'. So t24 t35 would be from NT26.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 can go to 't24'. Let's note that.\n\nWait, let's start from the beginning:\n\nt16 t97 t51 t24 t30 t13 t15 t90 t15 t63 t18 t20 t11 t20 t24 t63 t97 t13 t11 t73 t93 t90 t60 t33 t11 t60 t33 t33 t33 t11 t30 t73 t71\n\nLooking for possible NT29 and NT21 splits:\n\nLet's see NT29 can produce t93 t20 (from NT59 \u2192 t93 t20). Alternatively, looking at other NT29 rules\u2014maybe I missed it. Wait, actually, wait, in the grammar, NT29 is part of NT59's production. Hmm, maybe I need to look for NT59.\n\nBut in any case, let's try to match the string step by step.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree must be a binary tree. So the string's length must fit the rules. The start symbol S generates two non-terminals, each of which can generate sequences ending in terminals.\n\nLet me check the length of the string. It's 36 tokens. Since each production in CNF either produces 2 non-terminals or a terminal, the number of non-terminals minus the number of terminals should equal 1. Wait, but since each step increases the depth, maybe it's better to think recursively.\n\nAlternatively, each time a node is expanded, it splits into two, so the number of leaves (terminals) is equal to one more than the number of internal nodes (non-terminals). So for a string of n terminals, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree would be n-1.\n\nBut 36 terminals would imply 35 non-terminals, but since each non-terminal is of the form AB or A, it might not be possible. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead try to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to check if all the terminals appear in the grammar, as the grammar's terminals are part of the rules.\n\nLooking at each t token:\n\nt16, t97, t51, t30, t13, t15, t90, t63, t18, t20, t11, t73, t93, t90, t60, t33.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see each of these is present as a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 t15\n- NT30 \u2192 t30\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking for t16: NT41 \u2192 t16 T (since NT41 has a production NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, which leads to t73 t51, but t16 is in NT41 \u2192 t16 t something. Wait, actually, NT41's production is NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, which becomes t73 t51. So NT41 can produce t73 t51, but t16 is elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe t16 is from NT41 \u2192 t16 ... but I'm not seeing that directly. Let me check all NT rules for t16:\n\nLooking through each NT rule, the only t16 is in NT41's production. So in NT41, we have a production that leads to t16. So yes, t16 is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSimilarly, all the t tokens in the string are present in the grammar as terminals, so that's a good sign.\n\nNow, attempting to parse step by step:\n\nThe string starts with t16. Let's see which NT rules can derive t16.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 t16 t something? Wait, NT41 can go to t73 t51, but t16 is elsewhere. Wait, maybe I'm missing that. Looking again, I don't see t16 as a direct terminal in any NT production except possibly via other expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong. Let's check each NT rule:\n\nNT41: NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47 \u2192 t73 t51. So NT41 \u2192 t73 t51. So t16 isn't a direct terminal in NT41.\n\nBut looking elsewhere, maybe I missed something. Let me check all NT rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT1 \u2192 t73, but that's in NT70\u2019s production.\n- NT70 \u2192 t51, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the t16 comes from NT24, which is a terminal (t24). But the string starts with t16, which isn't t24. So maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different strategy, like trying to split"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nSince the first token is t33, and in the grammar, the only way t33 appears is as the result of NT33, which is NT59 NT34. But neither NT59 nor NT34 have a rule that directly produce t33. So perhaps t33 can be derived from NT33, but for that, I need to see if NT33 can be broken down further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to list all possible terminals at the leaves:\n\nLooking at the grammar, which symbols are terminals? The rules that have 't' followed by a number are the terminals. So:\n\nt50, t97, t34 (as NT34), t24, t2, t18, t49, t56, t73, t11, t15, t16, t19, t20, t23, t35, t38, t51, t60, t63, t71, t80, t90, t1, etc. Wait, no, the terminals are when their production rule ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking back, each production is either A->BC or A->a. The 'a's are terminals. So any terminal that appears in the string must be a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo looking at the string: t33, t35, t2, t91, etc. So, t33, t35, t2, etc. I need to check if each of these terminals is in the production rules as direct productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce t33. Similarly, t2 is produced by NT28 (if any), let me check: NT28 -> NT52 NT28? Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT28 -> NT52 NT28? No, that's not right. Wait, the rules have:\n\nNT24 -> t24\nNT38 -> t35\nNT58 -> t20\nNT20 -> t18\nNT29 -> t48\nNT47 -> t51\nNT1 -> t73\nNT33 -> NT59 NT34\nWait, but I don't see a rule that produces t33 directly. So maybe t33 isn't in the grammar, or perhaps it's a non-terminal that can derive some terminal string, but perhaps that's a problem because the string starts with t33, which isn't a terminal according to the grammar provided.\n\nWait, did I miss any direct terminal symbols? Let's see: Looking through the production rules, the direct terminals are in the right-hand side of 'A->a' productions. So, for example:\n\nNT58 -> t20\nNT20 -> t18\nNT29 -> t48\nNT47 -> t51\nNT1 -> t73\nNT33 -> NT59 NT34\nWait, so t33 isn't a terminal in any of the direct productions, it's part of a non-terminal NT33's production. So that would mean that t33 cannot be a terminal symbol; it's a non-terminal that can't be reduced further because the only way to get t33 is from NT33, which isn't a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, we have t33 as the first symbol. That would mean that the parser should find a way to produce t33, but according to the grammar, that's impossible because t33 isn't a terminal, and NT33 doesn't have a production that leads directly to t33. Therefore, the string starts with t33, which isn't possible under this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Let me double-check. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so the starting symbol is S, which breaks down into NT29 NT21. The string starts with t33, which is likely part of NT29 or NT21. But since t33 isn't a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal, so maybe NT29 -> ... where one of the parts is NT33. But even then, to get t33, it would need to appear as a terminal, which it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is incorrect, or I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces t33: I don't see it. Similarly, no NT directly produces t23 or others. Wait, in the string, the tokens include t35 which is produced by NT38 -> t35, so that's fine.\n\nWait, the first token is t33, but in the grammar, the only NT that could produce a terminal is NT33, which needs to be broken down further. But NT33's production is NT59 NT34, which also don't directly produce t33.\n\nSo perhaps the string is invalid because the first symbol is t33, but the grammar doesn't have any rule that directly lets you produce t33 as a terminal. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT19: NT19 -> t15. But t15 is a terminal. So NT19 can produce t15, but no NT is directly producing t33.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string can't be generated because it starts with t33, which the grammar doesn't allow as a terminal. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-605","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a standard form where each rule is a non-terminal producing exactly two non-terminals or terminals. The string I need to check is a sequence of tokens, which seem to be either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, let me outline the process. Since the grammar is in CNF, an efficient way to check the string would be using the CYK algorithm, which parses the string in linear space and uses a dynamic programming approach. That might be the best way, even though it's a bit more complex. Alternatively, I could try to build a derivation tree manually, but given the length of the string, that might be too time-consuming.\n\nLet me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. From the grammar, I notice that some of these tokens are on the right-hand side of the production rules, like 't97', 't50', etc. These seem to be terminals, whereas the others, like NT26, NT15, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: t91 t93 t91 t18 t60 t93 t72 t51 t93 t33 t2 t73 t91 t49 t16 t73 t50 t18 t73 t35 t73 t87 t20 t13 t90 t72 t72 t87 t2 t73 t87 t51 t73 t71.\n\nThat's 33 tokens long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so the derivation tree for the string must have a binary structure. The CYK algorithm constructs a table where each cell represents a substring of the string and checks for which non-terminals can produce that substring.\n\nBefore diving into the CYK table, I should identify which of the string tokens are non-terminals. Looking at the grammar rules, the non-terminals are all tokens starting with 'NT' followed by numbers, except for those that have production rules, like NT5, NT24, etc. Wait, actually, the grammar is a context-free grammar, so every symbol except terminals must be non-terminals. But wait, the problem here is that in the grammar, there are terminals, like 't97', 't50', etc. So in the string, any occurrence of these 't' followed by numbers are terminals, and the others are non-terminals.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the tokens are:\n\nt91 (terminal), t93 (terminal), etc., alternating between terminals and non-terminals? Wait, no, let me list them:\n\nPositions (0-based index):\n\n0: t91 (terminal)\n1: t93 (terminal)\n2: t91 (terminal)\n3: t18 (terminal)\n4: t60 (terminal)\n5: t93 (terminal)\n6: t72 (terminal)\n7: t51 (terminal)\n8: t93 (terminal)\n9: t33 (terminal)\n10: t2 (terminal)\n11: t73 (terminal)\n12: t91 (terminal)\n13: t49 (terminal)\n14: t16 (terminal)\n15: t73 (terminal)\n16: t50 (terminal)\n17: t18 (terminal)\n18: t73 (terminal)\n19: t35 (terminal)\n20: t73 (terminal)\n21: t87 (terminal)\n22: t20 (terminal)\n23: t13 (terminal)\n24: t90 (terminal)\n25: t72 (terminal)\n26: t72 (terminal)\n27: t87 (terminal)\n28: t2 (terminal)\n29: t73 (terminal)\n30: t87 (terminal)\n31: t51 (terminal)\n32: t73 (terminal)\n33: t71 (terminal)\n\nWait, this can't be right. The string is a single line with 34 tokens, so index 0 to 33. So each of these tokens is a component of the string, potentially a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nNow, the grammar's non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT24, NT47, etc. The rest are terminals if they start with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is of the form NTXY -> NTAB, where NT is a non-terminal and A, B are either non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t97, t50, etc. So in the string, each 't' is a terminal, and the NT's are non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, every token is either a non-terminal (NT24, etc.) or a terminal (t91, t93, etc.). So the string is a sequence of symbols, each of which is either a non-terminal (from the grammar's left-hand sides) or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, and the grammar is structured so that S produces NT29 and NT21, which are non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals then produces other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nSo the CYK algorithm would work as follows: create a table where row i corresponds to the ith position in the string, and columns are symbols. The idea is to fill in table[i][j] to be the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring from i to j.\n\nIn CYK, for each symbol in the string, if it's a terminal, we look for all productions that have the terminal as a right-hand side. If any of those productions only have terminals as the rest (or none, meaning it's a unit production), then it can be generated directly.\n\nBut since this might take a lot of steps, perhaps I can try to see if the string makes sense by looking for possible starting points.\n\nLet me first see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the start is two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t91, a terminal. So let's see which non-terminals in the grammar produce t91. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t91. So if t91 is a terminal, it must be derived from a rule where a non-terminal is equal to a terminal. So perhaps in the grammar, t91 is a production of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT5, for example, there are rules like NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, etc. But I don't see any rule that directly produces t91. So perhaps t91 is produced by a non-terminal via a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar, not all non-terminals are present; it's possible that some non-terminals aren't in the provided rules but are used in the production, but in this case, perhaps t91 is a direct production of one of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT29, there's a production: NT29 \u2192 NT24 NT72.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar, looking at NT29, it's in the production NT46 \u2192 NT26 NT55, but I don't see NT29 being directly a terminal. Wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any terminal t91 directly; so perhaps the only way t91 can be generated is through a longer chain. So for the CYK approach, the terminal t91 must be generated by some non-terminal that has a production consisting of t91 and another terminal, but the problem is that in Chomsky normal form, all productions have two non-terminals on the RHS, except for terminals, which are leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps in this case, the terminals are the ones that have productions where one of the non-terminals can produce a single terminal. For example, some NT might have a production like NTn \u2192 tXYZ NTm, but wait, CNF requires that each production has two non-terminals on the RHS, so if a NT's production includes a terminal, it must be in such a way that allows for that. Hmm, no, wait: in CNF, all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So wait, in that case, the terminals are directly derived from a single non-terminal.\n\nSo that means that in the grammar, some non-terminals must have productions that directly produce terminals. Wait, but looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is directly equal to a terminal (e.g., NT5 \u2192 t93). So perhaps in this grammar, all terminals are only produced through a chain of productions, and perhaps in this case, the string can't be generated because t91 isn't directly produced.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-624","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the provided string can be generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or terminals on the right. The starting symbol is S, which breaks down into NT29 and NT21. Each of these NT symbols represents non-terminals that eventually need to be expanded into terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t72 t18 t16 t33 t18 t35 t11 t63 t11 t49 t11 t72 t90 t24 t56 t20 t49 t73 t35 t15 t48 t2 t51 t73 t16 t2 t35 t73 t90 t93 t91 t13 t23 t91 t51`.\n\nI should probably start by tracing how the starting symbol S could generate this string. Since S directly expands into NT29 NT21, the string should be a combination of the sequences generated from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at each part:\n\n1. NT29: Let's see the production rules for NT29. From the grammar, I see NT29 -> NT29 NT21 (wait, that seems like it's part of a cycle, but more importantly, looking through all NT29 rules, I don't see any that start with 't'. That's a problem because in the string, the first part starts with t72, which would have to come from NT29. But looking at the grammar, NT29 doesn't have any production that starts with a terminal symbol; all its productions have non-terminals. So that's a dead end.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT29 is only present in the production of NT59: NT59 -> NT29 NT34. So that's one place where NT29 is used. But how does NT29 get resolved into terminals?\n\nFrom the provided grammar, there are no rules that directly produce t72, t18, etc., for NT29. That suggests that perhaps NT29 can't produce those terminals, meaning that the string can't start with t72 because it would require NT29 to start with a terminal, which it can't in this case.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me recheck:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21. So the string must start with whatever NT29 can produce. But in the string, the first token is t72. So does NT29 have a production that starts with t72? Looking at all the rules for NT29, I don't see any. The closest is NT59 -> ... but that's under NT59.\n\nSo unless I've made a mistake in reading, that suggests that NT29 can't generate t72. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar. But let me check if there's a way to link S to NT29 and then have that generate t72.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me go through the NT29 rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules in the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT29 NT34\n- Other NTs, but NT29 doesn't have a direct production to terminals. So NT29 can only generate other non-terminals, which in turn might produce more non-terminals or eventually terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t72. Let me see where t72 comes from in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, t72 is produced by NT72, and looking at the rules for NT72:\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\nNT65 -> NT37 NT52\nNT52 -> t63\nWait, no. Wait, looking back at the terminal rules:\n\nLooking at the rules starting with NT33, I see NT33 -> NT29 NT34 (twice), NT10 -> NT5 NT19, NT13 -> 't50', and others.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the terminals. Let me list all the rules where a terminal starts:\n\n- NT28 -> t37\n- NT58 -> t20\n- NT68 -> t30\n- NT19 -> t15\n- NT35 -> t11\n- NT60 -> t49\n- NT34 -> t48 (twice)\n- NT0 -> t93\n- NT24 -> t24 (but that's a terminal?

Let me look:\n\nIn the grammar, looking for where the terminals are:\n\nLooking at each line, for example:\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\nWait, but this could be a terminal. Wait, wait, let me parse each rule:\n\nEach line starts with a non-terminal followed by either a single non-terminal or a double dash, then two non-terminals, or in some cases, a string starting with a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, some rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT51 -> 't87', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, some rules start with a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n- NT59 -> 't93'\n- NT35 -> 't20'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n- NT20 -> 't18'\n- NT20 -> 't72'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT24 -> 't91'\n- NT47 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT71 -> 't90'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't30'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n- NT36 -> 't20'\n- NT19 -> 't33'\n\nWait, so some of these non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT58 -> t20\n- NT20 -> t18\n- NT20 -> t72\n- NT29 -> t48\n- NT24 -> t24 (is this a terminal? Wait, but in the string, there is a t24. So NT24 can generate t24.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t72 t18, it's t16, t33, etc. So for S -> NT29 NT21, the first part would be NT29 generating some string, starting with t72, which requires that NT29 has a production that starts with a terminal, but from what I see, NT29 is only in the production of NT59 as NT59->NT29 NT34.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT29 is generated only in NT59.

Let's see:\n\nNT29 is used in NT59's production, so perhaps NT59 could eventually lead to the t72.\n\nBut let's check the dependencies.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59-> NT29 NT34.\n\nSince we need to get t72, which comes from NT72, which is derived as NT72->NT65 NT37.\n\nWait, let's map this.\n\nIf S->NT29 NT21,\n\n- NT29 part: Need to reach a terminal. Let's think about how NT29 can expand into something. Since NT29 is only in NT59's production, perhaps the expansion happens through NT59.\n\nSo let me build a possible derivation path for the t72.\n\nFrom S: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT21: looking at the grammar, NT21's production is NT20 NT55.\n\nSo S produces NT29 (which needs to become t72) and NT21 ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It consists of a series of production rules, each non-terminal (like S, NT29, NT47, etc.) transforming into other non-terminals or terminals (like 't97', 't50', etc., which I assume represent terminal symbols). The goal is to see if this grammar can derive the given string.\n\nI need to parse the string by following the grammar's production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule produces two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. This means that every step in the parse should produce two tokens (or one terminal and one non-terminal, but in CNF, every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal).\n\nNow, looking at the string provided, it's a sequence of terms starting with 't93' and ending with 't11'. Each term seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nThe first approach is to consider whether each terminal in the string is directly produced by some rule in the grammar. That is, for each 't...', does the grammar have a production that directly outputs it?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 (and others) \u2192 't93'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' and 't60' (Wait, but in CNF, production rules have two symbols on the right, both non-terminals or terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT5 \u2192 NT93\nWait, looking through the grammar, some non-terminals like NT5 produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking each rule, yes, there are several:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't93' directly\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' directly\n- NT30? Wait, no. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\nSo NT58 \u2192 't63'\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\nNT34 \u2192 't60'\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check all the rules to find where each term comes from.\n\nLet me list out each non-terminal and see if it ends with a terminal in the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't93' \u2705\n- NT20 \u2192 't18' \u2705\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' \u2705\n- NT5 \u2192 't93' \u2705\n- NT29 \u2192 't48' \u2705\n- NT18? Wait, not seeing. Wait, NT18 isn't a non-terminal; looking through the list.\n\nWait, maybe the string has tokens that are being produced by the grammar.\n\nSo each token in the string is a terminal, and each must be the result of a production step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 B C, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo to parse the string, we'd start from the top symbol S and expand it step by step using the productions until we reach the terminals, which should match the string.\n\nBut with such a large string, this might be tedious. Instead, I can try to check if all the terminals in the string are present as terminals in the grammar and then see if the grammar can produce those in order.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are:\n\nt93, t30, t13, t18, t71, t18, t18, t90, t16, t71, t63, t80, t18, t15, t97, t16, t16, t11, t11, t63, t2, t30, t16, t49, t87, t80, t23, t91, t35, t33, t50, t73, t2, t20, t11.\n\nI need to see if each of these is directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\n- t93: Yes, NT5 \u2192 t93\n- t30: Does any non-terminal produce t30? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT30? Wait, I don't see NT30 in the rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n- NT58 -> 't52' (Wait, no, let me check: NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. NT52 is a non-terminal, and NT28 \u2192 't20'. So NT58 produces 't20'?\n\nWait, I'm confused. Each rule has two symbols on the right. So to get a terminal directly, the rule must be A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking again through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT15 \u2192 t71\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT26 \u2192 multiple non-terminals, not terminals\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' and 't60' but wait, not in one production.

Let me look again.\n\nWait, the grammar seems to have each production as A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But only some of them have terminals on the right.

The string is quite long and contains a bunch of tokens starting with 't' and some numbers. The grammar consists of several production rules where non-terminals (NT) break down into other non-terminals and eventually into terminal symbols, which I assume are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are the actual strings. However, in this grammar, I see some rules where a non-terminal is derived into two terminals, like the rule where NT13 is 't50'. This might be an issue because CNF allows only two non-terminals on the right side, but if a rule has two terminals directly, that's allowed. Wait, no\u2014CNF typically allows A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, but some variations might include production rules where a non-terminal is directly a terminal. But in the given grammar, I don't see any production rules where a non-terminal is directly a terminal except the ones where they produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT13 \u2192 't50' and NT52 \u2192 't63'. So those are terminal symbols.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't30', which I think is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar rules, which NTs produce 't30'? I'll go through the list.\n\nLooking for NTs that have 't30' in their production:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18' and 't72'\n- NT68 \u2192 't30' (Yes, I see NT68 \u2192 NT20 NT30 in the rules?

Wait, no\u2014looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT68 is part of the rule NT58 \u2192 't20' and 't30'? Wait, let me check again.

Let's list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't50'\nNT1 \u2192 't73'\nNT70 \u2192 't51' 't36'\nNT15 \u2192 't71' 't68'\nNT59 \u2192 't0' 't58' (t0 is maybe a typo for 't93'? Wait, the user wrote 't93' but in the string, it's 't93' appears in NT59 \u2192 't0' 't58' but in the string, I have 't93' appearing, so perhaps 't0' is 't93'.\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nI think a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form allows for top-down parsing, where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. But perhaps it's easier to simulate this with the string.\n\nThe string is: t30 t72 t73 t51 t24 t23 t49 t97 t15 t91 t33 t30 t33 t35 t51 t24 t33 t63 t97 t20 t30 t51 t16 t48 t73 t35 t33 t90 t2 t20 t48 t91 t87 t73 t50 t50\n\nBut wait, when I look, the string seems to have some 't's followed by numbers, but perhaps I should see if each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if the string can be built step by step according to the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step would replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and this would repeat until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nBut considering that the grammar's rules are a bit complex, maybe I can find the path that could generate the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward way is to try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the rules. For example, starting with 't30', which must come from a rule that produces 't30'. Looking at the rules, I'm not immediately seeing a rule that directly produces 't30' as a terminal. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't20' 't30'\nAh, yes, rule NT58 \u2192 NT20 NT30. So 't20' and 't30' are terminals. So for 't30' to appear in the string, it must come from NT58 expanding to 't20' 't30'.\n\nNow, in the string, the first token is 't30'. So before that, there must be a NT58, which expands to 't20' and 't30'. But in a top-down parser, we start from the start symbol S, which should expand into a series of these rules. Let me check what S expands into.\n\nThe start symbol S is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S expands to NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT? Let's see. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't48' 't60'. Wait, no, NT29's rules are:\n\nLooking through the rules: Wait, NT29 is not in the list. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT29 is mentioned in the rule:\n\nNT29 is mentioned in NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but that's not relevant here. Looking again, the rules for NT29: it's in NT59 \u2192 't0' 't58'\u2014wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let's clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps this is not the best approach. Another idea is to try to write out the entire parse tree for the given string, checking at each step whether the rules match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to realize that for a string to be generated by this grammar, each token must correspond to a production, and each production must expand correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach is to note that the grammar as given is a binary tree grammar in CNF, so the string must have a length of 2^n, where n is the number of splits. But in this case, the string's length is 49 tokens, which is not a power of two. Wait, 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64, so 49 is not a standard CNF tree depth. But that doesn't necessarily rule it out, because the string can have non-derivations, but perhaps the length must be exactly 2^n when all non-terminals are expanded. However, here, 49 is not a power of two, which suggests the string might be invalid.\n\nBut that's a quick thought, but perhaps not accurate. Let me check: in a binary tree derivation, each non-terminal splits into two, so the number of symbols (leaves) is 2^n, where n is the number of splits. So the total length of the string should be 2^n, so for example, for n=5, 32 symbols, n=6: 64. Our string has 49 symbols, so it's in between, which suggests that such a string cannot be derived because 49 isn't a power of two. So that would mean No.\n\nWait, but that's a key point. If the number of tokens is not a power of two, then under the assumption of a binary expansion, the string is invalid. However, I have to make sure that the grammar does not allow any variation, but in CNF, each rule must produce exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals, which cannot split. So each step increases the number of symbols by multiplying by 2, starting from 1 (S).

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, I notice the start symbol is S, which is rewritten as NT29 NT21. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. That means to generate the start string, we'll need both NT29 and NT21 to be expanded into terminal symbols.\n\nNow, looking at the string to evaluate: it's a series of 't' followed by numbers, each representing a terminal symbol. Each 't' number is a terminal, so I need to see how these can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out all the terminal symbols and see which parts of the string match them. The terminals in the grammar are t35, t33, t35, t2, t15, t50, t49, t48, t20, t2, t51, t16, t71, t93, t60, t51, t50, t51, t51, t49, t73, t15, t60, t23, t49, t13, t13, t73, t16, t71, t91, t91, t56, t24, t33, t50. Wait, actually, the string provided seems to have each terminal directly, no variables.\n\nI'll start breaking down the string into parts that might correspond to the non-terminals. Let's take the first few tokens: t35 t33 t35 t2 t15 t50 t49 t48 t20 t2 t51 t16 t71 t93 t60 t51 t50 t51 t51 t49 t73 t15 t60 t23 t49 t13 t13 t73 t16 t71 t91 t91 t56 t24 t33 t50.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to find how these terminals can be produced by the non-terminals. Let's check the productions again. \n\nFor example, NT59 can produce t58 t52, NT72 can produce t65 t37, etc. But wait, the string starts with t35. Looking at the grammar, which non-term produces t35.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what I know about CNF. A grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it indeed seems to be in CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t15 t20 t56 t87 t87 t97 t97 t56 t2 t60 t56 t63 t80 t18 t56 t80 t15 t72 t51 t35 t63 t93 t30 t63 t35 t80 t80 t16 t23 t2 t48 t90 t33 t91 t23 t35`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. Let's start by looking at the structure of the grammar.\n\nStarting from S, the production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S must produce two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. That means the string we're evaluating must start with the symbols generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't49'. Let me check which non-terminal this comes from. Scanning through the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't93', NT34 \u2192 't48', and looking further, NT29 \u2192 't48' and NT47 \u2192 't51'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I think NT29 is under the start symbol S.\n\nWait, let me check the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo S produces NT29 and NT21. Now, the first symbol in the string is 't49', which corresponds to NT65, I think, because looking at the productions, I see NT65 \u2192 't56' and other terminal productions. Wait, no, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find that some non-terminals expand to terminals directly. For example, NT5 \u2192 't93', NT34 \u2192 't48', NT58 \u2192 't20', and so on. So, each non-terminal either produces two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSince the string starts with 't49', I need to find which non-terminal expands directly to 't49'. Scanning under the productions, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't49'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let me list all possible terminal symbols and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't0' and 't58'\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT54 \u2192 't92'? Wait, but looking at the list:\n\nWait, the list is a bit confusing. Let me make a list of all NT symbols and their productions to terminals:\n\nNT65 \u2192 't56' and 't56' again, I think? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar provided has many NTs mapping to other NTs and some to terminals. Let me list each NT and its terminal productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't0', 't58'\n- NT5 \u2192 't11'\n- NT28 \u2192 't24' (and another 't24'? No, wait: NT24 \u2192 't24' and so on.\nWait, it's better to go through each NT and note their terminal symbols.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't49', which is in the NT60 \u2192 't49' production.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT60 \u2192 't49'. So, the production NT60 \u2192 t49.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string:\n\nt15: Let me see if any NT produces t15. Looking at the grammar, I see NT71 \u2192 't10', NT19 \u2192 't15', etc.\n\nt20 is produced by NT58 \u2192 't20' (since I see NT58 \u2192 't52' and 't20')? Or wait, no: looking at the productions, NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT2, but also, I think some other NTs produce 't20'. For example, NT38 \u2192 't20', and NT58 \u2192 't20', so maybe NT58 can produce 't20' directly.\n\nWait, let's confirm: in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 't52' and 't20'? Or NT20 \u2192 't18' and others. Wait, perhaps it's better to check which non-terms produce 't20'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't20' (NT38 \u2192 t20)\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n\nSo, both NT38 and NT58 have a production that results in 't20'.\n\nIn the string, we have several 't20's. So perhaps these come from NT38 or NT58.\n\nBut let's go back to the first symbol. The string starts with 't49', which is produced by NT60. So the first part of the string should come from NT60, and the second part from NT24, but wait, no: the start symbol is NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, no: the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo the entire string must be generated by NT29 and NT21. So each of these non-terms must be expanded into a sequence of symbols that produce the string segment.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t49 t15 t20...\n\nSo for NT29, I need to see what it can produce. Let's look at the grammar rule for NT29.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT29 appears in S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so S's first child is NT29.\n\nWhat does NT29 produce? Looking at the productions, I don't see NT29 as a non-terminal in any production, except under S. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the grammar data wrong.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar correctly. Looking at the production rules:\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of lines, each line being a rule. For example, the first line is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then other lines are various NT rules.\n\nWait a second, I realize that in the given grammar, each production is of the form A \u2192 X Y or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and X, Y are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut looking back, I now notice that in the given grammar, NT65's production is: NT65 \u2192 NT56 NT24, and also NT65 \u2192 NT24 NT56. Wait, no, the lines are all written as A \u2192 B C, so each line is a production for A.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, after S, the first production is NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, followed by NTs like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT60, etc.\n\nSo, looking for NT29, I see in the given grammar that NT29 appears in the line S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S can be expanded into NT29 followed by NT21.\n\nBut does NT29 have any production rules besides being part of the start symbol? Or is it a terminal? No, NT29 is a non-terminal that's part of S's expansion, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT29 except S's.\n\nWait, that's crucial. So NT29 is only present as S's child; there's no production for NT29 itself. Therefore, to produce the first symbol in the string, which is 't49', that must result from NT29 somehow. But since NT29 only appears in the start symbol, which produces NT29 NT21, perhaps NT29 has an inherent production that only comes from S.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Or perhaps NT29 is actually a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any non-terminal NT that is written on the left-hand side is a non-terminal. The right-hand side can be terminals or non-terminals. So, if a NT appears only on the left-hand side, it's a non-terminal.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT29 is a non-terminal because it's the first symbol in S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

{"custom_id":"request-665","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The user presented both the grammar and the string. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars consist of a set of production rules. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically requires each production to have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the right-hand sides (RHS) seem to follow this structure\u2014they\u2019re either two non-terminals or a terminal, except maybe some might have more, but let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, most are like NT26 -> NT24 NT72, which fits CNF. I notice some produce terminals like NT1 -> 't70', which is a single terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is: `t56 t63 t13 t2 t51 t49 t72 t93 t35 t72 t71 t35 t72 t35 t11 t11 t72 t48 t35 t2 t18 t50 t63 t91 t93 t18 t97 t24 t50 t80 t30 t73 t63 t51 t73 t50 t24`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. One approach is to apply the bottom-up parsing technique since the grammar is in CNF. Alternatively, I could generate all possible strings of the same length to see if it's among them, but that's impractical.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which in the first production is: S -> NT29 NT21. So the string must start with NT29 and NT21 expanding to the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t56, which is 't56'. So I need to see which rule produces t56. Looking through the rules, I find NT52 -> 't63', NT13 -> 't50', NT37 -> 't2', NT34 -> 't60', NT5 -> 't93', NT36 -> 't20', NT19 -> 't15', NT68 -> 't30', NT1 -> 't70', NT70 -> 't51', NT50 -> 't71', NT52 -> 't63', NT24 -> 't24', and so on. Wait, but I don't see a rule that produces 't56' directly. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT24 -> 't24', but I also have NT24 -> NT10 NT57, etc. So 't24' must come from NT24. Now, looking for 't56', I don't see any rule on the RHS of NT56, but wait, perhaps it's a terminal in a rule elsewhere? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I notice that some rules have multiple RHS, but looking through all, I don\u2019t see any that directly produce 't56'. This is odd. Did I miss a rule? Let's review the rules again.\n\nHere's what I see:\n\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT1 -> 't70'\n- NT70 -> 't51'\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n- NT52 -> 't63', 't63', 't63'? Wait, looking at the rules, NT52 has multiple entries, like NT52 -> 't63' and also NT52 -> 't63'? Wait, no, let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules: \n\n- NT52 appears twice:\n\n1. NT52 -> 't63'\n2. NT52 -> NT24 NT28\n\nSimilarly, NT28 is another rule. So 't56' must come from some rule, but I don't see any rule with 't56' on the RHS. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how NT52 is processed. Wait, no, 't63' is for NT52.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is 't56', but the grammar doesn't have a production that directly expands to 't56'. That's a problem because, in a CFG, every terminal in the string must come from a production rule that directly produces it or via intermediate non-terminals.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT52->'t63' twice. Where else? Let's see:\n\n- NT52 -> 't63' (twice)\n- NT1 -> 't70', 't73', etc.\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT52 -> 't63' again.\n\nWait, is there a rule that produces 't56'? Let me check again. Perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT24 has two entries: NT24 -> 't24' and NT24 -> NT10 NT57.\n\n- NT38 -> 't35', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't56' comes from NT1, which becomes 't70', but I don't see how that connects. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong because NT52->'t56' is not present, which would be needed for 't56' in the string. Therefore, this suggests that the string might not be generated by the grammar. But that seems too fast\u2014maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another approach. Maybe 't56' is produced by a non-terminal that is derived from other rules. Let's see if NT52 can produce 't56', but in the rules, I don't see it. Wait, perhaps NT52 is part of a longer derivation. Wait, no, in the given rules, all the RHS of NT52 are either 't63' or NT24 NT28.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Since the string starts with 't56', but there's no rule that directly produces it, that suggests that the string might not be derivable from S.\n\nWait, but the first production is S->NT29 NT21. So the string must start with a terminal derived from NT29 and another from NT21. So the first part is NT29, which is t48 (from the rules, looking at NT29: NT29-> 't48'). So first token is t48, then the second should come from NT21.\n\nLooking at NT21 -> 't50', or wait, I need to check the production for NT21. Looking back, I don't see a production for NT21 except possibly the ones mentioned. Wait, no, the first two lines of the grammar are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nWait, in the given list, there's a production for NT21: \"NT21 ->'t18'\". No, I'm looking again. Checking the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for NT21 in the rules, not sure. Wait, the user provided a lot of rules. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the rules provided, such as:\n\n- \"NT21 -> 't18'\": Yes, in the rules. So NT21 produces 't18'. So the start symbol S's production is NT29 and NT21, which produce t48 (from NT29: NT29-> 't48') and t18 (from NT21: NT21->'t18'). So the first two tokens should be 't48 t18'.\n\nBut in the provided string, the first token is 't56', not 't48', so this suggests that the string does not start with the correct derivation. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the productions. Let me confirm:\n\nDo any of the RHS in the rules produce 't56'? Scanning through all the rules:\n\n- The rules for terminals are:\n\nNT1 -> ... 't70'\n\nNT70 -> ... 't51'\n\nNT50 -> 't71'\n\nNT52 -> 't63'\n\nNT24 -> 't24'\n\nOthers like NT37->'t2', NT34->'t60', NT1->'t73', NT71->'t90', etc.\n\nWait, is there any 't56' in the rules? Not that I can see. So 't56' is not directly produced by any rule, which means the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the initial production S->NT29 NT21 starts with '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: \n\n`t15 t63 t48 t18 t87 t93 t49 t90 t13 t60 t63 t71 t18 t33 t63 t24 t20 t71 t63 t91 t90 t56 t93 t72 t18 t72 t49 t48 t91 t2 t20 t97 t93 t49 t18 t13 t15 t56`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or terminals. Each production has at most two symbols on the right side.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. So, the first step is to produce NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t15, which is a terminal. Let me check which non-terminals produce t15. Checking the productions, I see NT15 -> NT71 NT68 and also a production NT15 -> NT70 NT47, but wait, no, looking again, the productions for NT15 include:\n\nWait, I see:\nNT15 -> NT71 NT68 and NT15 -> NT70 NT47? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT68 appears as the right-hand side in a production: NT41 -> NT2 NT36, and I see:\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT15 -> NT71 NT68 and also NT15 -> NT70 NT47.\n\nWait no, actually looking at the given grammar:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake in parsing. Let me list all the productions that produce t15, which are the terminals.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see that t15, t16, t20, t23, etc., are terminals. Specifically, looking for where terminals are on the right-hand side:\n\nSome terminals are on the RHS:\n\n- NT71 -> t51\n- NT47 -> t51\n- NT70 -> t51\n- NT37 -> t2\n- NT34 -> t60\n- NT58 -> t20\n- NT33 -> t23\n- NT51 -> t87\n- NT20 -> t18\n- NT55 -> t10\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. The productions are mostly for non-terminals turning into other non-terminals, except for some where the RHS has terminals.\n\nLooking carefully, for example:\n\nNT0 -> t93\n\nNT13 -> t50\n\nNT37 -> t2\n\nNT34 -> t60\n\nNT24 -> t24\n\nWait, yes, NT24 has a production NT24 -> 't24', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT38 -> t35, NT58 -> t20, etc.\n\nSo, terminals can appear directly as results of productions. So, in the given string, when a token like t15 is present, it must come directly from a production that includes it as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the string, the first token is t15. So, that must come from a production where the RHS includes 't15' as part of the symbols. Looking through the productions:\n\nI think I need to find all production rules that include a terminal in their RHS. So, let's list all the terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT0 -> t93\n- NT5 -> t93\n- NT13 -> t50\n- NT37 -> t2\n- NT34 -> t60\n- NT24 -> t24\n- NT60 -> t49\n- NT41 -> t16\n- NT26 -> t13\n- NT68 -> t30\n- NT33 -> t23\n- NT51 -> t87\n- NT58 -> t20\n- NT55 -> t10\n- NT19 -> t15\n- NT68 -> t30\n- NT55 -> t10\n- NT28 -> t37\n- NT71 -> t51\n- NT72 -> t65\n- Additionally, in the given string, after t15 comes t63, which is a non-terminal, since it's not in the list of terminals. Wait, wait\u2014no, wait, in the given string, every token is either a number in quotes like 't15' or a number without quotes, like t93, t18, etc.\n\nWait, I need to check which of these are terminals. From the grammar, the terminals are the ones that appear on the RHS, like t15, t20, etc.\n\nIn the grammar, I see that the following non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT5 -> 't93'\nNT13 -> 't50'\nNT37 -> 't2'\nNT34 -> 't60'\nNT24 -> 't24'\nNT60 -> 't49'\nNT41 -> 't16'\nNT26 -> 't13'\nNT68 -> 't30'\nNT33 -> 't23'\nNT51 -> 't87'\nNT58 -> 't20'\nNT55 -> 't10'\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT71 -> 't51'\nNT72 -> 't65'\n\nWait, for example, NT72 -> t65, but in the given string, after t15 comes t63, so perhaps that was a typo, but perhaps I made a mistake in seeing the string.\n\nWait, let me re-express the string:\n\nt15 t63 t48 t18 t87 t93 t49 t90 t13 t60 t63 t71 t18 t33 t63 t24 t20 t71 t63 t91 t90 t56 t93 t72 t18 t72 t49 t48 t91 t2 t20 t97 t93 t49 t18 t13 t15 t56.\n\nSo, every element is a string like 't15', 't63', 't48', etc. So, in the grammar, some of these are terminals, others are non-terminals that can produce more symbols.\n\nBut from the grammar, the only way to reach terminals is through their production rules. For example, NT19 -> t15, so when NT19 is expanded, it produces t15.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t15. So, in the derivation, that would have to come from a production where NTA -> t15. Looking at the grammar, we have NT19 -> t15 t68? Wait no, let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nI see NT19 -> 't15' and later in the productions, there's NT19 -> 't15', so that's a production NT19 can produce 't15' directly.\n\nAdditionally, checking other possible terminals. For 't63', let's see if there's any production that produces 't63' as a terminal, but from the grammar as provided, I don't see any production where RHS is a terminal 't63'. Therefore, 't63' must be part of a non-terminal chain.\n\nWait, but the string contains 't63' several times, so perhaps 't63' arises from a non-terminal that can expand into it.\n\nSo, let's go step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t15, which comes from NT19. Now, looking at NT19's productions, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see:\n\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- One production might be NT19 -> 't15' or perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check the full grammar:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT19 in any productions except perhaps the very end:\n\nWait the last few lines are:\n\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT19 -> 't13'\n\nSo, NT19 has two productions:\n\nNT19 -> t15\nNT19 -> t13\n\nSo, when deriving, if we have NT19, it can produce either 't15' or 't13'.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't15', so that must come from a production where NTA -> 't15'. That would be NT19 -> 't15'.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I'll break down the problem. CNF implies that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (like NT26, S, etc.) and terminals (like t97, t50, etc.). Each non-terminal produces two non-terminals, except when it directly produces a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t90, followed by t50, t93, t18, and so on. I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token, t90. I check where t90 appears as a terminal.

Let me see. There's NT51 \u2192 't87', not 't90'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT70 is a non-terminal. NT70 \u2192 't51' and also NT70 \u2192 't51' via another production: NT70 \u2192 't51' in another rule?

Does NT70 ever produce a terminal directly? I don't see a rule like NT70 \u2192 't90' or any other terminal in its productions. So how does t90 get produced? Maybe through another non-terminal.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t90, so somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal must produce t90. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t90. Let me scan through all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 't90'.

Since it's in CNF, that's fine because each production has two non-terminals, or a single terminal. Wait, no, that's a single terminal, which is allowed in CNF as each production can have one or two symbols on the RHS. So, the grammar isn't violating CNF because of that.\n\nNow, let's look at the string to check if it can be generated by the grammar. The string consists of a series of tokens that map to terminal symbols. To see if the string fits, I'll need to find a derivation starting from S that can produce this sequence.\n\nLet's start by seeing what S produces. According to the grammar, S -> NT29 NT21. So the string must start with NT29 followed by NT21. Let's see if the string starts with t48 t91, which are the results of NT29 and NT21, respectively. Because NT29 -> t48 and NT21 -> t91.\n\nSo the first two tokens should be t48 t91. Looking at the string: yes, first two tokens are t18 t48. Wait, that doesn't match. That's an issue because the first two tokens should be t48 t91, but they're t18 t48. That means it's impossible. So the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT29 and NT21 again.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> t48\n\nNT21 -> t91\n\nSo, S starts with NT29 NT21, generating 't48 t91'. But the string starts with 't18 t48', which doesn't match. That's a red flag.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the first symbols don't match the start symbols of the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a good start because it has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t73 t60 t48 t18 t15 t60 t15 t80 t15 t33 t72 t15 t72 t51 t51 t50 t50 t30 t80 t23 t71 t71 t20 t24 t20 t50 t23 t2 t49 t24 t48 t80 t2 t2 t30 t56 t97 t15 t2 t15`.\n\nAnd the grammar has a bunch of rules. I need to see if this string can be derived using the grammar's productions.\n\nFirst, note that in CNF each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol is S. So the derivation would start with S on the left, and each step either replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation would need to produce this step by step. To check this, perhaps a way is to construct a parse tree where the leaves are the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nBut manually building the parse tree for such a long string would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for occurrences of the string's terms in the grammar and see if they match.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n- So NT0 becomes 't93', and NT58 is another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't93' towards the end.

{"custom_id":"request-722","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out whether the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or a single terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky Normal Form typically involves productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. However, sometimes terminal symbols can appear on the right, but in this case, it seems all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. Hmm, actually, the production S can also have two non-terminals, so I think this grammar is in a slightly different form, perhaps allowing for more general productions, but I'll assume it's structured such that each production is a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals, except where terminals are introduced.\n\nNow, looking at the string provided: `t20 t33 t80 t13 t90 t20 t91 t91 t15 t33 t16 t18 t23 t11 t20 t2 t11 t91 t49 t20 t18 t63 t30 t18 t72 t97 t87 t13 t50 t30 t33 t80 t93 t18 t11 t80 t80 t87 t18 t50`.\n\nI notice that each word in the string is a terminal symbol, mostly 't' followed by numbers, except for some like 't97', 't87', etc. But in the grammar, there are rules that produce these terminals, and also some rules that produce non-terminals which may further expand.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string from the end towards the beginning, trying to see if each terminal can be matched by the grammar, and ensuring that non-terminals can expand into other symbols as required.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt a top-down approach by trying to derive the string starting from the start symbol S, applying the productions as appropriate.\n\nLet me write down the string and break it down into individual symbols:\n\nt20, t33, t80, t13, t90, t20, t91, t91, t15, t33, t16, t18, t23, t11, t20, t2, t11, t91, t49, t20, t18, t63, t30, t18, t72, t97, t87, t13, t50, t30, t33, t80, t93, t18, t11, t80, t80, t87, t18, t50.\n\nWait, that's a long string, but perhaps I can check if each symbol can be derived from the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the sequence of non-terminals that could expand into the string.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check each symbol from the left, trying to see if the grammar can produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to match the string symbol by symbol, backtracking as necessary, but that could be time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for the order of symbols in the string and see if there's a pattern that matches any production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t20, t33, t80, etc. Hmm, perhaps I can see which non-terminals produce t20, t33, etc., and then see if those can be part of a chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some productions produce terminals directly. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21, but I think NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals that may further expand into terminals.\n\nWait, for example, looking at S: S produces two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. Each of these could be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT29: production rules that expand into NT29 include NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but that's a terminal production. Wait, no, let me correct that. Wait, from the grammar, some NT rules produce terminals, like:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t20\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t20 (from NT58 -> t20).\n\nSimilarly, NT57 \u2192 t20 is present?\n\nWait, let me parse through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n\nWait, but I'm looking for NT rules that produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-742","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the given string is generated by it. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the productions, most of them are like NT followed by two other non-terminals, except some are terminals. The string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, so my job is to parse this string through the grammar to see if it can be derived.\n\nThe string is: `t13 t13 t11 t97 t91 t51 t13 t72 t16 t13 t80 t18 t50 t87 t50 t73 t15 t73 t71 t90 t49 t60 t33 t71 t71 t87 t50 t30 t2 t90 t49 t80 t15 t87 t63 t90 t60 t18 t13 t93 t13`.\n\nI notice that the string has about 40 tokens, but each term is separated by spaces, so each token is a single character or a two-digit number. Wait, no, actually, each is one 't' followed by numbers, like t13, t97, etc. So each 't' is followed by digits from 0-9, but each production rules seems to correspond to either a combination of non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces two NT29 and NT21. Each of these in turn produces other combinations until they reach terminals.\n\nI think this grammar is designed such that each non-terminal corresponds to a function that expands into certain terminals. For example, let's check NT29. Does it have a production that leads to t13? Let me look through the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 NT15 NT65. Hmm, that's two NTs. Let me see if any NTs lead directly to terminals. For instance, NT52 \u2192 't63' and NT24 \u2192 't24' or nt91.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by starting from the string and trying to break it down into the grammar rules. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can parse it by looking for possible splits.\n\nAnother approach is to map each 't' and 'digits' to the non-terminals that can produce them. For example, if a production is NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34 and NT59 can lead to t93, t33, etc., depending on their rules.\n\nBut perhaps I should construct a parse tree. Let's see: the string starts with t13, t13, t11, t97, etc. So first, t13 appears multiple times in the string. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces t13.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT13 \u2192 't50'. Wait, that doesn't give t13. Or NT19 \u2192 't15' and 't93'? Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT13: Not present. Hmm.\n- NT19: NT15 NT65 \u2192 't15' and 't90'? Or wait, NT19 \u2192 't15'? Let me check:\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking for any NT where the production is NT13 as a terminal. Checking the list:\n\n- NT13 is defined as 't50', so no. There's 't13' but only once in the productions? Let me check which NTs have 't13':\n\nWait, looking through all the productions:\n\n- NT24: 't24' (so NT24 produces t24)\n- NT25: Not in the given productions, so maybe not.\n- NT13: \u2192 t50, which is 't50', so not helpful.\n- NT62: 't63'\n- NT47: 't51'\n- NT55: 't48'\n- NT0: 't93'\n- NT1: 't73', 't70', 't14' etc.\nWait, looking again, I don't see an NT directly producing t13. Does that mean that in the string, the t13 must be produced by a combination? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I missed it. Let me scan all the production rules for terminals:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT59: appears as the right-hand side (RHS) of several productions, but in some cases as a terminal? Wait, in the line \"NT57 -> NT68 NT2\", no. Looking through all the RHS lines, none directly expand to t13 yet.\n\nWait, the rules for terminals are lines where a production is like \"NT24 -> 't24'\". Let me list all the RHS that are terminals:\n\nLooking through each RHS:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' \u2192 yes\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT47 \u2192 't51'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15'\n- NT62 \u2192 't63'\n- NT51 \u2192 't87'\n- NT73 \u2192 't73'\nWait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one non-terminal on the right. The start symbol is S. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that S starts with NT29 and NT21. Each NT has its own production up to terminals like 't97', 't2', etc. \n\nMy task is to parse the given string step by step according to the grammar, starting from S and breaking down the string into parts that match the rules. \n\nLet me start by breaking the string into individual tokens since they seem to be connected by spaces, so each 'tXX' is a separate token. \n\nThe string has tokens: t90, t97, t90, t18, t72, t80, t80, t73, t87, t73, t33, t35, t24, t49, t18, t18, t48, t23, t93, t91, t13, t35, t48, t56, t90, t49, t30, t90, t13, t90, t16, t15, t13, t48, t56, t11, t16, t16, t71, t30.\n\nNow, starting with S, which can be split into NT29 and NT21. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21. \n\nNext, I need to see how the string starts with t90, which is supposed to come from NT29. So let's look at what NT29 can produce. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT29 directly, but NT29 is used in the production of NT33. Wait, no, the rules given don't have NT29 except in the production of NT33: NT33 -> NT29 NT34. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing some rules here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT39 -> NT46 NT62, but that might not help for NT29. Maybe NT29 is part of another rule. Alternatively, perhaps the productions are spread out, and I might have to follow the chain.\n\nWait, another approach is to start from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar. So starting from the first symbol, t90, which should be a result of some rule. \n\nLooking at the rules, t90 is produced by certain NTs. For example, looking at NT50: NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24. But wait, t90 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I see that NT51 \u2192 't87', which is a terminal. Hmm, but looking for t90, I notice that NT37 \u2192 't2', which might not help. Wait, maybe I'm missing how t90 is produced.\n\nWait, stepping back: perhaps I'm getting lost in the rules. Maybe it's better to try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string starts with t90, which would come from NT29. So NT29 must expand to t90 via some chain.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT29: I don't directly see it, but perhaps it's the leftmost alternative in another rule. Wait, NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34, so if NT33 is derived from elsewhere, it could produce t90 as part of it.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find a way to produce the string by breaking it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or CYK parsing would be effective, but since I'm doing this manually, it's tricky.\n\nAnother idea is to see if each token can be matched by some production. For example, t90 must come from NT29, t97 from NT52, etc. Let's check each token:\n\n1. t90: NT29?\n2. t97: NT52?\n3. t90: NT29?\n4. t18: Maybe NT56 or NT20?\n5. t72: NT65?\n6. t80: NT33?\n7. t80: NT33?\n8. t73: NT57?\n9. t87: NT13?\n10. t73: NT57?\n11. t33: NT35 or NT58?\n12. t35: NT48?\n13. t24: NT1...\nWait, this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for whether the string can be entirely generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parse tree can be constructed step by step.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string is split into [t90, t97, ..., t30], where the first two tokens are the two parts of S.\n\nBut wait, the entire string must be derived from S, meaning it's a combination of two parts from NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t90, which must come from NT29. So the first part of the expansion is nt29 \u2192 t90, and the second part is nt21 \u2192 t97.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because S is divided into two, so each part needs to be a subtree. Alternatively, S is NT29 NT21, so the entire string is a concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo the first part of the string (starting with t90) comes from NT29, and the second part (starting with t97) comes from NT21.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts:\n\nFirst part: t90 t97 t90 t18 t72 t80 t80 t73 t87 t73 t33 t35 t24 t49 t18 t18 t48 t23 t93 t91 t13 t35 t48 t56 t90 t49 t30\n\nSecond part: t90 t13 t90 t16 t15 t13 t48 t56 t11 t16 t16 t71 t30\n\nWait, but the initial S splits into two parts, so the first token t90 is from NT29, followed by t97 from NT21. So the string should be the two parts combined.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for how the string can be divided into the two parts generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo starting from the beginning:\n\n- t90 \u2192 generated by NT29.\n- Then, the next token is t97 \u2192 generated by NT21.\n\nSo, the string is divided as t90 (NT29) followed by t97 (NT21), making the first two symbols. Then, the rest of the first part continues.\n\nBut then, the next token after t97 is t90, which would have to come from NT29 again, so the expansion would be something like NT29 \u2192 t90 NT29 NT21. Wait, that doesn't make sense because NT29 can't produce more NT29 and NT21. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production of NT29 and NT21 can only derive a single terminal, but obviously, that's not the case. So each NT can produce sequences that eventually become terminals through their productions.\n\nSo, each NT in the grammar has its own production tree. For example, NT52 produces t97, NT52 can't have more NTs on the left. So, for t97, it must be the end of the NT52 part.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string can be split into two parts, with the first starting with t90 (NT29) and the second starting with t97 (NT21).

The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure makes parsing easier, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT29 NT21. So any valid derivation must start with NT29 NT21.\n\nThe input string starts with t11 t48... The first step is to match the initial symbols. Let's see: the original question breaks down the grammar starting with S -> NT29 NT21, so the string must start with the terminals from these two non-terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking at the productions for NT29 and NT21:\n\n- NT29 produces t48 (looking at the rule NT29 -> NT47 NT59 and others, but wait, maybe I should find the immediate productions. Wait, in the rules, NT29's productions aren't listed, but looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for S -> NT29 NT21, and then NT29's production: I need to check all the rules and see which apply to NT29 and NT21. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all the rules for NT29 and NT21 first.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT29: I need to check all rules starting with NT29. Scanning through the rules: It looks like there are several rules, but none directly starting with NT29. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT29 -> NT47 NT59 (yes, the first rule that starts with NT29 is NT29 -> NT47 NT59. So that's one option.\n\nSo, S -> NT29 NT21 becomes NT29 (which is NT47 NT59) and NT21 (which is NT55 NT60, from the rule S -> NT29 NT21, and NT21 is either NT55 NT60 or another rule? Wait, no, in the grammar list, NT21 is produced by NT55 NT60 (looking at the rules: yes, NT21 -> NT55 NT60).\n\nWait, perhaps I got confused. Let me list the rules for NT21. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for rules where the left-hand side is NT21. The rules are:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- I see NT21 -> NT55 NT60 at line 51. So yes, NT21 is NT55 NT60.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 is NT47 NT59 at line 3.\n\nSo, the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21 \u2192 (NT47 NT59) (NT55 NT60)\n\nSo the initial left-hand side expansion is four symbols: NT47, NT59, NT55, NT60.\n\nThe string starts with t11 t48... Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate the given string.\n\nBut that might be a bit complex, so perhaps a better approach is to look for the string's tokens and see if they can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt11 t48 t90 t72 t20 t71 t15 t63 t50 t20 t72 t15 t20 t73 t23 t56 t16 t18 t97 t97 t63 t93 t18 t2 t73 t80 t35 t56 t16 t51 t35 t50 t15 t51 t11 t30 t60 t23 t51 t80 t23 t90.\n\nLet me start from the beginning and see if the tokens can match the grammar rules.\n\n1. The first token is t11.\n\nLooking into the grammar, which non-terminals produce t11.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT5 -> t93 (line 23), NT36 -> t20 (line 34), NT50 -> t71 (line 49), NT21 -> NT55 NT60, and NT10 is NT5 NT19 (line 46). Hmm, wait, where is t11?\n\nWait, I think I might have misread.

So NT10 would be NT5 and NT19.\n\nNT34: NT64 NT55 (line 47). And NT64 is NT59 NT37 (line 15). So NT34's expansion would eventually get to t64 (as per line 15) and t55 (line 27). Wait, no, line 47 says NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55.\n\nWait, but NT34's right-hand side is NT64 and NT55.\n\nThen, NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37 (line15).

For example, NT52 \u2192 't97', so whenever we see 't97', that's produced by NT52. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 't50', so 't50' comes from NT13.\n\nLooking at the string, I need to see if each token can be generated by the grammar. Each token must be the result of a production.\n\nSo let's go through each token in the string and see if it exists as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt33 t11 t20 t13 t11 t24 t60 t20 t90 t97 t20 t91 t72 t71 t48 t24 t33 t13 t23 t15 t11 t35 t91 t73 t50 t73 t91 t23 t60 t50 t72 t18 t2 t48 t87.\n\nFirst, t33: Is there a non-terminal NT33 \u2192 't33'? Yes, NT33 produces 't33'. So that's good.\n\nNext, t11: Looking for a non-terminal that produces 't11'. Checking the productions, NT5 \u2192 't11'. So 't11' comes from NT5. Okay.\n\nt20: Let's check. So NT20 \u2192 't18' and 't72'. So both possibilities. But t20 can be 18 or 72. So that's acceptable because the string has t20 as a token, but in the grammar, the production of NT20 is 't18' and 't72', but wait, the grammar for NT20 is NT2 NT55. Wait, no, the grammatical structure isn't just the terminal; it's the sequence of non-terminals. So I might have to look at it differently.\n\nWait, no\u2014the production for NT20 is NT2 NT55, which means it's a non-terminal leading to NT2 and then NT55. So the terminal would be whatever terminal NT2 leads to, followed by whatever NT55 leads to. Hmm, so maybe I need to reconstruct the parse tree correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production for NT20 leads to two terminals, but I need to parse the string accordingly, using the CFG rules.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to process the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the fact that each token in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar, so each token must be a terminal (i.e., a rule that directly outputs that token). If any token does not have a corresponding production, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\nt33 \u2192 exists via NT33.\n\nt11 \u2192 exists via NT5.\n\nt20 \u2192 NT20 can produce 't18' or 't72', so it's okay.\n\nt13 \u2192 NT13 \u2192 't50'.\n\nt11 again \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't11'.\n\nt24 \u2192 NT24 \u2192 't91'.\n\nt60 \u2192 NT60 \u2192 't49'.\n\nt20 \u2192 't18' or 't72'.\n\nt90 \u2192 NT71 \u2192 't90'.\n\nt97 \u2192 NT52.\n\nt20 \u2192 same as above.\n\nt91 \u2192 NT91 \u2192 't91' via NT52 or NT24.\n\nt72 \u2192 NT72 \u2192 't56'.\n\nt71 \u2192 NT71 \u2192 't90' (since NT71 \u2192 't90' via 71\u219210\u219265\u219256, but I think the direct productions are only as per the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT71 \u2192 NT10 NT65.

Each production is a replacement for a non-terminal. So NT71 can be replaced by 't90', as per NT71 \u2192 't90'. Because in the grammar, there is a production NT71 -> 't90'.

{"custom_id":"request-786","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar. It starts with S, which breaks down into NT29 and NT21. Each of these NT symbols can further decompose into other NTs or terminal characters. My string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't63', 't51', etc. These must be terminal symbols because each line ends with a number. So, probably, each NT in the grammar eventually reduces to one of these terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a series of t followed by numbers. I notice that the numbers go from 15 up to 97, but the grammar's NT symbols seem to map directly to these t-number strings. My task is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each rule has two non-terminals on the left, or a single terminal on the left. Oh wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, or a single terminal. The given grammar is in CNF because each production is of the form NT->NT NT or NT->txxx, where txxx is a terminal string (since each 'txxx' is a specific terminal).\n\nWait, but the string has multiple t-nos, so each production rule in the grammar leads to two t-nos or more? Or wait, each production is a binary split, but the string is concatenated as a whole. So, to parse the string, it's a matter of whether the entire string can be generated by applying the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nThe key point here is to model the string as a binary tree where each internal node is an NT symbol, and each leaf is a terminal. The structure of the string corresponds to the structure of the grammar. So, for the string to be generated, it should be possible to decompose the entire string into the structure defined by the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the approach to validate this. One way is to use a top-down parsing method, starting from S, and splitting the string into parts according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reconstruct the parse tree bottom-up.\n\nBut since it's a single string, top-down might be simpler, but with 20 NTs, that could get complicated. Alternatively, I can simulate the possible splits.\n\nFirst, the initial string is the entire list given. Let's count the number of tokens, as each step in the grammar splits into two tokens, so the number of tokens in the derivation should be a power of two. Let's count the number of tokens in the given string.\n\nLooking at the string: There are 63 tokens: let me count:\n\nStarting from the first t63, each part is separated by a space, so 63 tokens in total. Wait, 63 is an odd number, but in a binary parse tree, the number of leaves is 2^n, where n is the number of splits. Wait, no, in a full binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of nodes plus one. But I might be mixing up something.\n\nWait, more accurately, the number of tokens generated by a context-free grammar in CNF will have a length that's 2^k -1, where k is the number of splits. Wait, no, the number of tokens (leaves) in a full binary tree with n internal nodes is n+1. But perhaps for our purposes, it's better to think recursively: each step splits a part into two, so the number of tokens should be a power of two, perhaps? Or not necessarily.\n\nWait, no, the number of tokens is the product of the splits. Since each rule splits into two, but each of those can split again, so the number of tokens at the end is equal to 2^depth, but I'm not sure. Maybe the issue is that the given number of tokens is 63, which is odd, 63 = 2^6 + ... Wait, 63 is 2^6 -1, which is 63. So, maybe the structure is possible? Or perhaps not.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think: in a full binary tree, the number of leaves is 2^h, where h is the height. But 64 would be 2^6, which is more than 63. So 63 is one less than that. Hmm, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the parse as splitting the string into parts according to the grammar's rules, checking recursively if each part can be split into the required subparts.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to look for any substring that matches the start symbol's production rules, and see if the rest can be parsed accordingly.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the parse trees of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t63. Let me see what NT63 corresponds to in the grammar. Looking at the given rules, NT63 is not present? Or wait, maybe I need to look through all the productions to see where each t-number maps to.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the given productions, many are of the form NTxxx -> something. For example, NT29 produces NT0 NT58, which then eventually produce terminals. Similarly, other NTs have productions that split into two NTs until they reach a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps the way to proceed is to see each token as a terminal, and check if the overall structure can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. That might be a feasible approach, although I'm not exactly sure how to implement it here, as it requires building a table and checking possible non-terminals at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the correct sequence of productions. For example, starting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the string should be the concatenation of the string derived from NT29 and the string derived from NT21.\n\nLet me check if the string can split into two parts: the first part derived from NT29 and the second from NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first tokens are:\n\nt63 t51 t51 t50 t48 t80 t73 t73 t13 t16 t80 t23 t91 t71 t23 t2 t24 t13 t90 t93 t80 t50 t15 t50 t93 t16 t23 t60 t18 t23 t56 t18 t33 t60 t50 t56 t72 t90 t56 t93 t71 t23 t87\n\nWait, that's a lot. Maybe I can check if the end of the string matches a production. Let me look at the last token: it's t71.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t71. Scanning through the grammar rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t70 t47\n\nWait, nope. NT1's production is different. Let me check all the rule lines:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for where t71 is on the RHS.\n\nYes, in NT58's production: NT58 \u2192 t52 NT28. Or wait, no. Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nNT17: Not present.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for terminals. For example, NT58 \u2192 t52 NT28.\n\nWait, looking through all the RHS:\n\nNT58 \u2192 t52 NT28.\n\nWait, or perhaps NT25 \u2192 t20 NT72? Hmm, but I don't think so. Let's check:\n\nLooking for t71:\n\nLooking through the rules, I think I see:\n\nWait, scanning through:\n\nLooking at NT71's rule: NT71 \u2192 t15 t65. Oh, that might not be.\n\nLooking for which NTs go to t71. Wait, in the NT rules, I see:\n\nLooking for t71 in the RHS.\n\nAh, yes, NT50 \u2192 t71's not there, but wait, in NT50: NT90?\n\nWait, perhaps it's in NTxxxx \u2192 ...t71.\n\nWait, looking at line: NT1 \u2192 t70 t47.\n\nHmm, let's see:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see that NT70 \u2192 t51 t36, as per one of the lines:\n\nNT70 \u2192 t51 t36.\n\nWait, but that's not t71.

{"custom_id":"request-788","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it restricts the productions in a way that makes parsing and analysis easier. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to break down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals, except for when terminals (strings of single characters like 't24') are present. The terminals represent the actual characters in the language.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t24 t13 t16 t97 t49 t71 t73 t73 t35 t51 t97 t48 t23 t48 t49 t87 t51 t11 t51 t97 t91 t50 t30 t51 t16 t35 t24 t33 t48 t63 t51 t15 t87 t60 t91 t35 t23 t15 t56 t73 t60 t20 t90`. \n\nI think the best approach is to try to derive this string using the given grammar. Since each production results in two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), every step in the derivation should split a non-terminal into two parts. The string given has 40 symbols, all of which are terminals, so each terminal will come from a production that eventually ends in a terminal.\n\nI'll start by trying to see if the entire string can be broken down starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as `S -> NT29 NT21`. So, the first two symbols should be the results of deriving NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: `t24 t13 t16 ...`. Wait, actually, no\u2014looking back, the first symbol is `t24`. But S is `NT29 NT21`, so the first step would produce two non-terminals. So the entire string must be split into two parts, each generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a sequence of 40 symbols. But each application of a production doubles the length, so let's think differently. Each step in the derivation will produce more symbols. Starting with S (1 symbol), each production step increases the string length by one because a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which can be a mix of non-terminals and terminals. \n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, so each application of a production adds one symbol (since one non-terminal is replaced by two). Therefore, the length of the string increases from l to l + 1 with each production step. Since the original S is one symbol, after n production steps, the string length would be 1 + n. If the final string has k symbols, then n = k - 1. Here, the string has 40 symbols, so n = 39 steps.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to work backwards, trying to split the string into possible components derived from NT29 and NT21, and then recursively check each part.\n\nLet's start by trying to split the entire string into two parts that could come from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nSo, the first part must be derived from NT29 and the second from NT21.\n\nI'll write the string as [Part1] [Part2], where Part1 comes from NT29 and Part2 from NT21.\n\nNow, let's look at the first symbol in Part1, which is `t24`. Let's see which NT29 production could generate `t24` as its first symbol.\n\nLooking at the NT29 productions:\n\nNT29 -> NT10 NT26\n\nNT29 -> NT47 NT15\n\nWait, the grammar as given. Wait, let me check the full list again.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is provided. Let me check all productions for NT29.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminals. Hmm, that's a good start because it simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t71 t73 t73 t48 t2 t49 t91 t91 t35 t18 t33 t90 t23 t16 t13 t93 t49 t24 t13 t11 t11 t50 t63 t97 t24 t33 t97 t97 t80 t50 t60 t33 t2 t90 t87 t23 t23 t60 t15 t2 t60 t91`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT52 -> 't97', so whenever NT52 appears in the derivation, it can produce 't97'. Similarly, other non-terminals have direct productions to specific terminals.\n\nI need to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and try to derive the given string. Let me parse the string and see how the non-terminals can produce it.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't71'. Looking at the grammar, I check where 't71' is a production. From the grammar, NT19 -> 't71'. So, in the derivation, we can have NT19 produce 't71'. So the first symbol comes from NT19.\n\nNext, after 't71' is 't73'. Looking at where 't73' comes from: NT1 -> 't73'. So, after NT19, we can have NT1. So far, S -> NT29 NT21, but let's see.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. Let me check NT29. From the grammar, NT29 is defined as -> NT0 NT58. Hmm, but wait, I need to see how 't71' can be produced. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't71', which comes from NT19, so we have NT19.\n2. Next is 't73', which comes from NT1. So the next non-terminal must be NT1.\n   So now we have NT19 -> 't71' followed by NT1 -> 't73'.\n\nBut S is NT29 -> NT0 NT58. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT19 and NT1. But the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the steps.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the string as a sequence of terminals, and at each step, try to find which non-terminals can produce those terminals in succession.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t71 t73 t80 t30 t73 t48 t2 t49 t91 t91 t35 t18 t33 t90 t23 t16 t13 t93 t49 t24 t13 t11 t11 t50 t63 t97 t24 t33 t97 t97 t80 t50 t60 t33 t2 t90 t87 t23 t23 t60 t15 t2 t60 t91.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. 't71' -> NT19\n2. 't73' -> NT1\n3. 't80' -> NT11 (Looking at grammar: NT11 -> 't80')\n4. 't30' -> NT21 (NT21 -> 't30')\n5. 't73' -> NT1 again\n6. 't48' -> NT24 (Wait, NT24 -> 't24' but in the grammar, is there a 't48'? Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't5 NT60' but wait, no, in the list, I see NT26 -> 't13', so perhaps 't48' comes from NT24? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar again for 't48'.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, I see NT26 -> 't13', NT24 -> 't91', but perhaps that's not it. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't24' (in one rule) and 't91' in another. So where is 't48'? Let me go through the grammar to see where a non-terminal directly produces 't48'.\n\nLooking through all the grammar entries:\n\nWait, I don't see any direct terminal 't48' except as part of a larger production. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see: perhaps 't48' is produced by NT24 elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT60 -> NT33 NT48\nWait, yes! Here we go. NT60 -> 't48' via the production NT60 -> 't48'. So 't48' comes from NT60.\n\nWait, but the string has a 't48' after 't73 t48', so the next symbol is 't48', which would have to come from NT60.\n\nSo, let me correct the parsing steps:\n\n1. t71: NT19\n2. t73: NT1\n3. t80: NT11\n4. t30: NT21 (since NT21 -> 't30')\n5. t73: NT1\n6. t48: NT60\n\nSo now, to derive 't73 t48', we have NT1 -> 't73' followed by NT60 -> 't48'.\n\nBut in the grammar, where do we get NT1 followed by NT60? Let's check the rules that have NT1 followed by something.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT29 produces NT0 and NT58, but not directly NT1 and NT60. Wait, maybe I should look for productions where NT1 is followed by NT60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see if S can produce a sequence that includes these terminals.\n\nWait, starting from S, which is NT29 -> NT0 NT58.\n\nLet me try to break down S:\n\nS produces NT29 (which is -> NT0 NT58) and NT21 (which is -> 't30').\n\nWait, so for the start, S -> NT29 NT21. So the first symbols would be whatever NT29 produces and then NT21 produces, which is 't30'.\n\nBut our string starts with t71, which is produced by NT19, so perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Maybe I need to consider that the start is S, which produces two parts, and perhaps the string is formed by concatenating the productions of these two parts.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use memoization and try to parse the string from left to right, checking which non-terminals can produce the necessary sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to NT29 and NT21 productions.\n\nLet me try that. So S -> NT29 NT21, so the entire string should be a combination of the symbols produced by NT29 and then NT21.\n\nBut S is in the form of NT29 followed by NT21, which in production form outputs NT29 Production followed by NT21 Production.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of what NT29 produces and what NT21 produces.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe total length is 54 symbols. Let's call the first part (up to some point) as what NT29 produces, and the rest as NT21 produces.\n\nBut wait, NT21's production is 't30', so the string must end with 't30'. Let me check the string: the last symbol is 't91', which would need to come from NT1. But wait, NT21 -> 't30', so the string must end with 't30', but it ends with 't91', which is from NT19. That's a problem.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the last symbol is 't91' (from NT19), but according to S, the second part"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-806","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar given in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see what I remember about CNF and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal symbol, or two non-terminals. That should make things a bit easier because, in CNF, the derivation process mirrors the structure of the string directly. So each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal becomes a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t30 t24 t18 t97 t30 t93 t23 t72 t87 t23 t15 t71 t73 t50 t11 t49 t16 t18 t11 t63 t90 t35 t56 t2 t87 t56 t63 t63 t13 t15 t23 t71 t71 t33 t80 t15 t80 t35 t30 t2 t72 t80 t80 t97`.\n\nWow, that's a long string! It's all lower terminals, no non-terminals, which suggests that the derivation would end directly with terminals. So each symbol in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar, going back from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which starts as NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols in the string must derive from NT29 and NT21. Let me look at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nSo the first two tokens should be generated by NT29 and NT21. Let's look at the string:\n\nFirst token is t30. So NT29 should produce t30. Let me check the productions for NT29.\n\nLooking for NT29 in the productions: Oh, here's one: NT29 -> T34 T55. But wait, T34 is '34' as a terminal? Or wait, no. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, T34 is a non-terminal, no. Wait, no, the productions like NT34 -> 't64'... Wait, let me check: Oh, 't64' is a terminal symbol. So looking for NT29: I see NT28 -> 't37' etc. Wait, let me check the NT29 productions.\n\nLooking through the list: Oh, no, I don't see NT29 except in the NT28 and NT34, etc. Wait, no. Let me look through all NT29 in the productions. Hmm. Wait, it's not present. Wait, maybe I'm missing it.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT28 -> 't37' etc., and NT34 -> 't64'. Wait, but for NT29, let me scan all the rules. Hmm, I don't see NT29 in the head of any production except in NT28, NT34, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the non-terminals are listed, and I have to check if any of them produce 't30'. Wait, looking for any NT that can produce 't30'. Let me check each production.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT26: 24 38, produces 't13', 't18' etc.\n\nWait, looking specifically for 't30' in the productions:\n\nLooking through NT28: NT28 -> 't37' and 't28'?\n\nWait, the string starts with t30, t24, etc. So first token is 't30'. So I need to find a non-terminal NT that can derive 't30'.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions:\n\nLooking for any NT with a production that ends in 't30':\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT38: no, it's 't35'\n\nNT58: 't20'\n\nNT57: no 't30'\n\nNT68: no\n\nNT63: no\n\nNT41: no\n\nNT62: no\n\nNT1: looking for NT1 productions, none have t30 as a terminal.\n\nWait, let me start from the beginning. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe first symbol is t30, which must come from a production. So, for NT29: If NT29 has a production that leads to t30, but in our grammar, looking at the rules:\n\nI see in NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT58 -> 't52' NT2, etc. Wait, no NT directly produces t30.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't30':\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT38 -> t35, no.\n\nNT26: t13, t18, etc.\n\nNT72: t65, t37.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't30' except via a production that includes 't30' as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, did I miss any NT that directly has 't30'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nBTW, the user's grammar is long, so perhaps 't30' is a terminal derived from a non-terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't30'. So let me check if any NT can produce 't30'.\n\nLooking through the rules, wait, I don't see any NT that has a production producing 't30' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe 't30' comes from combining two non-terminals that produce something else.\n\nWait, no, because the first symbol is a terminal. So the first symbol is 't30', meaning that the initial NT (NT29) must directly produce it. But looking at the rules, I don't see any NT x where x directly produces 't30'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that NT29 can produce t30. Let me check each NT29 in the grammar. But I don't see any NT29 entries.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT29s:\n\nLooking through all the NT production lines, do any of them start with NT29?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT29 is not present as a rule head. Wait, did I miss it?\n\nWait, looking at the production list:\n\nI don't see any production for NT29. So, the NT that S starts with is NT29 and NT21. But NT29 is not a rule head in the grammar, so that would mean that S can't produce anything, which can't be right because the string starts with t30. Hmm, that suggests I may have made a mistake in parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT29 is N somewhere else? Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT29 isn't a rule head. Hmm, that can't be. So perhaps the initial S can't start with NT29, which is a problem because the first symbol is t30, which would require NT29 to produce it. But the grammar doesn't have NT29 as a non-terminal, so this suggests that the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because that's a massive hint towards it being not generated. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT29 is actually a typo and it's a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: The initial production is S -> NT29 NT21. So S can't produce anything unless both NT29 and NT21 have productions that generate terminals.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see NT29 or NT21 as the head of any production, unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let's check again:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\n- NT58 -> 't52' NT2\n\nWait, perhaps NT21 is a non-terminal, but in the list, the leading symbols like T1, T3, etc., are terminals, but NT21 appears as a rule head.\n\nWait, looking for NT21 in the rule heads: Oh, no, I don't see any rules with NT21 as head. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT1, NT2, etc., but not NT21. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe the S is NT29 NT21, which would each be non-terminals. But if they don't have any productions directly generating terminals, then S can't generate anything. But that can't be because the string is given as input.

{"custom_id":"request-820","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several non-terminals (NT) that eventually resolve to terminal symbols, denoted by 't' followed by some numbers. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar structure. Each non-terminal on the left side of the arrows produces exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for some that produce terminals and numbers, like 't2', 't60', etc. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding these non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the string: it's a long sequence starting with 't63' and ending with 't97'. I need to see if each terminal in this sequence can be derived from the non-terminals defined in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the grammar into its components. Each rule is in the form NTAB -> NTAC NTAD, except for the ones that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT29 -> NT0 NT58\n\nAnd so on. The string has a lot of terminals, so it's about finding if each can be mapped back to some rule in the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the beginning, I can try to find non-terminals that produce the first few symbols, then backtrack through the grammar to see if they can be connected back to the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, perhaps using a top-down approach or memoization might help, but with this many symbols, it's probably too time-consuming manually.\n\nWait, the string is 43 symbols long. Each step in the derivation would produce two symbols, so the number of steps should be related to the depth of the derivation tree. The start symbol S is at the top, so the derivation would expand until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, giving a string where each production step contributes to the sequence.\n\nBut given the number of symbols, that might not be feasible to do manually. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if terminals like 't63' and 't13' correspond to specific non-terminals. For instance, looking at the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the rule NT52 -> 't63', so 't63' is directly derived from NT52.\n\nSimilarly, 't13' is from NT13 -> 't50'. Hmm, that's interesting because 't50' is used in other rules, like NT50 -> NT64 NT24, which eventually leads to 't24' and others.\n\nWait, let's check the provided string: the first symbols are 't63', 't93', 't2', 't51', etc.\n\nSo let's see:\n\n- 't63' is from NT52. So to get 't63', NT52 must be expanded. Looking at the grammar, NT52 has the rule NT52 -> 't63'. So that terminal is directly generated.\n\nSimilarly, 't93' is from NT0. Because NT0 -> 't93' (as per the rules I see). So 't93' is directly from NT0.\n\nHmmm. So the string starts with S expanding to NT29 and NT21, as per the first rule.\n\nBut the string starts with 't63' which is from NT52. How do we connect that? Let's see:\n\nThe string is `t63 t93 t2 t51 t71 t93 t11 t91 t13 t63 t71 t51 t80 t30 t90 t48 t48 t13 t87 t49 t72 t71 t60 t33 t18 t73 t97 t60 t20 t60 t97 t91 t18 t30 t87 t90 t13 t60 t11 t80 t56 t51 t49 t11 t24`.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each terminal and see how they relate to non-terminals.\n\nLet me list each terminal in the string and see if they can be mapped to non-terminals:\n\n1. t63 -> NT52\n2. t93 -> NT0\n3. t2 -> NT2 (since I see a rule for NT2 -> 't2')\n4. t51 -> NT51\n5. t71 -> NT71 or maybe another rule? Wait, looking at the non-terminals, I see NT71 -> 't90' but no, there's another entry: NT71 -> 't90' is not, but let's check. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see a rule where NT71 produces 't71'? Or maybe I do. Wait, in the rules, there's NT71 -> 't90', but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT71 -> 't90' is one of the options, but also NT5 -> 't93', NT50 -> 't71', perhaps. Wait, no, NT71 seems to be 't90', but where's the 't71' coming from? Or perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, in the list of non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n- NT57 -> 't68' and 't2'\n- NT59 -> 't0' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me go step by step for each terminal.\n\n1. 't63' is from NT52, as established.\n2. 't93' is from NT0.\n3. 't2' is from NT2.\n4. 't51'?\nLooking for 't51', I see NT51 -> 't87' and also NT39 -> 't80' etc. Wait, perhaps 't51' is from NT39? No, that would be 't80'. Wait, I don't see an NT that directly goes to 't51'. Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me check the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see a production that directly produces 't51'. So 't51' would have to be generated by some non-terminal that eventually leads down to a terminal, including 't51'. Let me look for such a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps S-> NT29 NT21. Then NT21 is from the rule NT21 -> NT55 NT52. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's go back to checking each terminal.\n\nTerminals:\n\n3. 't51' is the third symbol. So the string is t63 t93 t2 t51 t71 t93 t11 etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I only see terminals like 't13', 't50', 't2', 't3', etc. I don't immediately see a production that gives 't51'. That's a red flag. Because if the grammar doesn't produce 't51' as a terminal, then the string containing 't51' cannot be generated by it. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, do any of them directly produce 't51'? Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for any NT where NTXY -> 't51'. I don't see any such rule in the provided grammar. All the terminals are like 't2', 't5', 't60', etc., but not 't51'. Therefore, 't51' would have to come from a non-terminal that eventually resolves to it through a series of productions, but if none of the non-terminals directly produce 't51', then it's impossible for the string to contain 't51' unless it's generated by some two-step or more process.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production step only replaces a non-terminal with two others. So unless one of the non-terminals NTAB can produce 't51' through two steps, but since the grammar is a tree where each node expands to two children, and the leaves are terminals, then all symbols must be terminals or be derived in such a way that each non-terminal only produces terminals. So in this case, 't51' must come from some non-terminal that can produce it, but if none does, then it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't51', which the grammar cannot generate, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are either variables or terminal symbols in the grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right side except possibly the start symbol when it has a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT29 and NT21.

{"custom_id":"request-842","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can produce strings of non-terminals. The string given starts with a bunch of t's and numbers, but from what I remember, in CNF grammars, the left-hand side (LHS) of all productions are single non-terminals, and the right-hand side (RHS) are pairs of non-terminals or terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the RHS can have two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, right? Or is it strictly two non-terminals? Hmm, I think in CNF, the RHS is exactly two symbols, both non-terminals. Wait, no, sometimes in CNF, terminals can be allowed as well for simplifying parsers, but in some definitions, all productions on the RHS are non-terminals. I think the original Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, if the LHS is a non-terminal, the RHS must be two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, every production is of the form NTnumber \u2192 NTanother NTanother, except for some that just produce a terminal. Wait, actually, some have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, but others like NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60 are produced as non-terminals. Wait, no, wait. Let's check: each production in the grammar provided has two non-terminals on the RHS except for those that have a terminal, like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, where NT0 is a non-terminal, and NT58 is a non-terminal, but in this case, NT0 is a derived symbol from the production NT5. Wait, wait, let's look. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. Each production in the grammar is of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which might indicate that all productions are of two non-terminals. But wait, I'm looking at some productions like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, so NT0 is a non-terminal, but NT0 leads to 't93', which is a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, NT59 has a production that goes to a terminal. So, wait: the grammar seems to have a mix of productions where some RHS can produce terminals, while others just have non-terminals. So, perhaps in this grammar, some non-terminals are terminals at the leaf level, meaning that these non-terminals produce terminals, which are part of the lexicon.\n\nWait, but the way the grammar is written is a bit confusing. I think I need to figure out which non-terminals produce terminals and which don't. For example, some productions have a terminal like 't97', so that's a terminal. So, the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are those that appear in productions where the LHS is a non-terminal and the RHS includes a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals.\n\nWait, but the problem says that all non-terminals are in the productions as NT followed by numbers. But in the productions, some have a terminal like 't60' or 't50' as part of the RHS. So, those non-terminals must be connected to the lexicon.\n\nWait, but for the purpose of determining if the string is generated by the grammar, perhaps we can parse the string using the given productions.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of tokens, some starting with 't' followed by two digits. So, maybe each 't' is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals that can be expanded further. Let me list the string:\n\nt60 t87 t24 t63 t20 t18 t60 t11 t72 t63 t72 t30 t2 t16 t30 t11 t11 t35 t80 t16 t15 t2 t80 t30 t80 t90 t50 t13 t50 t13 t97 t11 t50 t30 t56 t51 t91 t63 t80 t51 t93 t13 t63 t11 t87 t63.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. So, we need to parse this string into the grammar's symbols. Each 't' followed by two digits is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 't' followed by two digits, like 't73', so NT1 is a non-terminal that can produce t73.\n\nSo, when parsing the string, we can think of it as a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and the grammar is applied to transform the sequence into the correct symbols.\n\nBut this is a bit involved. Perhaps we can approach this by building a parse tree or using dynamic programming for CYK parsing.\n\nWait, but I might need to see a step-by-step approach. Let's think about how the string might be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the problem: see if each symbol in the string can be expanded according to the grammar.\n\nWait, the string starts with t60, which must be matched by NT60 \u2192 t60, so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, but do any of the NTs produce t60? Looking at the grammar, let's see:\n\nLooking for NT60 in the productions: I see NT65 \u2192 NT59 NT64, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions, is there any NT that produces 't60'? Let me check each production.\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't60' or similar. For example, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT10 \u2192 t29 t34 (Wait, no: in the grammar, NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which is a production of non-terminals. Wait, let me check each production again.)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Some of the productions in the grammar have a terminal on RHS. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (both non-terminals), but there's also NT20 \u2192 t18 NT? No. Wait, no, let me see:\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT55 \u2192 t10 NT something?\nWait, perhaps I should look for any production where the RHS is a terminal followed by a non-terminal or something else.\n\nWait, let me go through each production:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-845","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is quite long, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. It consists of productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals, or one terminal. For example, S -> A B or A -> B C, etc.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions are of the form NTn -> NTm NTk, which means each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. However, some have one terminal on the RHS, like NT52 -> 't97' or NT13 -> 't50'. This means those non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of all terminal symbols (they all seem to be 'tXXX'). So, each token in the string must correspond to a terminal produced by the grammar.\n\nMy strategy will be to work backwards from the string, trying to see if each terminal can be derived by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by parsing the string into individual tokens:\n\nt50, t16, t33, t97, t48, t16, t24, t33, t23, t87, t87, t51, t73, t50, t2, t18, t91, t60, t48, t33, t30, t30, t48, t91, t50, t72, t20, t49, t80, t50, t24, t48, t97, t24, t73, t63, t56, t35, t49, t2, t23, t2, t73, t50, t30, t11.\n\nNow, I'll note which of these are terminals in the grammar. Actually, all these are terminal symbols as per the grammar definitions given. So, each token in the string must be the result of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLet me list all the terminal symbols present in the string and check if they appear in the grammar:\n\nt50, t16, t33, t97, t48, t24, t23, t87, t73, t30, t60, t91, t50, t72, t20, t49, t80, t50, t97, t24, t73, t63, t56, t35, t49, t2, t23, t2, t73, t50, t30, t11.\n\nWait, not all are in the grammar. Let me check each one against the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't97' \u2192 yes.\n- NT13 -> 't50' \u2192 yes.\n- NT37 -> 't2' \u2192 but 't2' is in the string.\n- NT59 -> 't0' (wait, the grammar has NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 -> 't93'. So 't0' isn't a terminal, but 't93' is. Wait, the string has 't2', but looking at the grammar, is 't2' present?\n\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, I see NT37 -> 't2' \u2192 yes. So 't2' is present.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals like t50 are present because NT13 -> 't50'.\n\nSo all terminals in the string correspond to some non-terminal that directly produces them.\n\nNow, I'll try to reconstruct a possible derivation.\n\nStarting from the entire string, I need to see if there's a way to break it down into the grammar's rules.\n\nBut since it's a long string, perhaps I should find the root symbol S and see if it can produce a substring that covers the entire string.\n\nLooking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo S = NT29 NT21.\n\nLet's see what NT29 and NT21 expand to.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> NT48 NT24.\n\nSo NT29 expands into NT48 NT24.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo S becomes NT48 NT24 NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, let's see each of these:\n\nNT48: Looking through the grammar, I see NT48 -> 't60'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSo first part of S is 't60'.\n\nNext is NT24. From the grammar, NT24 -> 't24'.\n\nThen NT55: NT55 -> 't10' because NT55 -> NT10 NT34, and looking further, NT10 -> NT5 NT19, NT5 -> 't93', NT19 -> 't15', so NT5 is 't93', NT19 is 't15', so NT55 would be NT10 (which is 't93') and NT34. Wait, but NT34 isn't a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT34 has multiple productions: some lead to terminals.\n\nLooking again, NT34 has:\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT34 -> NT24 NT55\n\nNT34 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT46 NT62\n\nAnd others, but none are terminals except when combined through other productions. Wait, no\u2014NT34 is a non-terminal because all its productions are two NTs except perhaps one, but looking again, maybe not. Hmm, perhaps there's a path where NT34 eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. Since NT24 is 't24', the third element of S is 't24'.\n\nThen NT55: I need to see what NT55 produces. Let me check NT55's productions.\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34.\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19.\n\nNT5 -> 't93' (from NT5-> 't93').\n\nNT19 -> 't15' (from NT19 -> 't15').\n\nSo NT55 is NT10 (which becomes 't93') and NT34.\n\nNow, NT34 can have multiple paths. Let's see:\n\nNT34 can expand into NT64 NT55, NT24 NT55, etc. But perhaps somewhere down the line, it leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, NT34 can lead to NT58 NT34, which could go to NT58 -> 't58' or further.\n\nWait, NT58 has NT58 -> 't52' according to NT58-> NT52 't20' ... Wait, wait, looking back, NT58 is:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT58: it's in NT58-> NT52 't20', but that can't be. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking back, the grammar has lines like NT59 -> NT0 NT58, etc. Let me see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs produce a terminal directly. For example, NT58 -> 't20'? Wait, no. Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT50 -> 't71' (line 50: NT5>50->'t71')\n- NT33-> 't23' (line 33: NT33->'t23')\n- NT50-> 't71'\n- NT52-> 't63' (line 52 is NT52->'t63')\n- NT15->'t70' (line15: NT15->'t70'NT47)\n- Wait, maybe I'm focusing too much on NTs that lead directly to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a tree for the string.\n\nBut given the length, it's better to find out if each token corresponds to a non-terminal and if their concatenation is possible via the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be derived from it.\n\nGiven S = NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 is 't60', NT21 is 't18' (from NT21-> NT55 NT52, which becomes 't18' because NT52 is 't63', wait no\u2014NT21 is NT55 NT52.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nS starts with NT29 (which is 't60') and NT21.

{"custom_id":"request-860","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, so I'll start by understanding each part and see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar. It consists of several non-terminals (NT) and terminals. Non-terminals are everything before the '->', and terminals are the ones that eventually become characters in the string. The grammar is in CNF, which means every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it might make parsing easier, but maybe not necessary for this task.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals connected by spaces: `t16 t71 t49 t35 t30 t50 t51 t60 t90 t97 t91 t97 t33 t80 t15 t56 t16 t50 t18 t49 t80 t91 t51 t20 t16 t15 t63 t48 t87 t90 t72 t15 t20 t80 t33 t73 t91 t23 t63 t48 t13 t51 t50 t80 t24 t51 t2`. I notice that each terminal appears to be a two-digit number, some of which might have been generated by the grammar's productions.\n\nNow, the goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, expands into NT59 NT64 and so on. Let me write down the possible productions for S to see the initial step.\n\nS -> NT59 NT64\n\nSo, the first two symbols of the string must come from NT59 and NT64's productions. Let me check the string: the first two are 't16' and 't71'. So does NT59 produce 't16'? Looking at the grammar rules for NT59:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\nNT37 -> 't2'\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\nNT65 -> NT37 NT56\nSo, wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me see the specific rules for NT59. From the grammar, NT59 can produce NT0 NT58, NT58 can produce NT52 NT28, NT28 -> NT37 NT72, and so on. Alternatively, looking at the list, NT59 can also produce NT10 NT26, NT52, etc. Alternatively, in the rules, NT59 appears multiple times, but I need to find if any of its rules can lead to 't16'.\n\nLooking at NT59's productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT59 -> NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nNT37 \u2192 't2'\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT65 \u2192 NT56 (from NT65 -> NT37 NT56)\nWait, but NT65 also appears in other places. Hmm, but none of the NT59 productions directly produce a terminal except via multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any direct production of NT59 to a terminal. From the list, NT59 can produce NT0 NT58, NT58 NT52 NT28, etc. Or maybe not directly. Wait, checking all the rules, NT59's options are:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nLooking back at the rules, I see:\n\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\n\nBut the string's first part is t16 t71... So perhaps that's not from NT59.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each NT59 production:\n\n1. NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n2. NT59 -> NT58 NT52 NT28? No, looking back, the rules for NT58 are:\n\nNT58: NT52 NT28 and others? Looking at the rules, I see NT58 -> NT52 NT28 and NT58 appears in NT19: NT19 -> NT53 NT34.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all NT59's productions:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT59: NT0 NT58, NT58 NT52 NT28, and also from NT59 appears in NT65 -> NT56 NT52... Wait, perhaps I got confused.\n\nWait, the grammar is a list of productions, each with a non-terminal on the left and a right-hand side. So, I should list each production where the left-hand side is each non-terminal.\n\nLet me parse the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT59 NT64\n\n- NT47 -> NT51 NT35\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\n- NT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nWait no, looking again:\n\nActually, each line is like NT26 -> NT24 NT72, etc. So, each line is a production for the non-terminal on the left. Let me write all the productions:\n\nNT26:\n-> NT24 NT72\n-> NT24 NT38\n-> NT24 NT38\n-> ... etc. Wait no, looking at the provided rules:\n\nLet me list all the productions correctly.\n\nWait, each line is the production for a specific non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF looks like. CNF is a form where each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, and all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals (with B or C possibly being terminals). \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I can see that most of them are of the form NT_number \u2192 NT_A NT_B, which fits the two non-terminals part. Some terminals are present, like t97, t2, etc., which are leaf nodes in the parse tree. \n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. \n\nI think the best approach here is to try to build a parse tree for the given string. Since the grammar is given, I can start from the top and see if I can derive the string step by step. Alternatively, I can use the leftmost derivation or the rightmost derivation method.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols in the string should come from NT29 and NT21. \n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t2. Wait, but S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the first two tokens should be the results of NT29 and NT21 productions. Wait, but the string starts with t2, which might be from NT29 or NT21. Let me check the rules for NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (rule 13)\nNT0 \u2192 t93 (rule 10)\nNT58 \u2192 t20 NT52 (rule 8)\nNT52 \u2192 t63 (rule 12)\nWait, that's not matching because NT58 is followed by t20, which is 't20'. But the string starts with t2, which isn't t20. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT21's rules. The first rule for NT21 is NT55 NT52 (looking at rule 21: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52). So NT21 produces NT55 and NT52.\n\nWait, rule 21 is NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21 would produce NT29 \u2192 some tokens and NT21 \u2192 other tokens.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t2. So maybe NT29 produces t2, or NT21 produces t2. Let me check the rules for NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, looking for NT29 in the rules. Rule 13: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. NT0 is a rule that produces t93. NT58 \u2192 t20 NT52, and NT52 \u2192 t63 (rule 12). So the production for NT29 is t93 t20 t63. That's t93 t20 t63. The string's first token is t2, which doesn't match this. So NT29 doesn't produce t2.\n\nWhat about NT21? Rule 21: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So it's two non-terminals. Let's look at NT55 and NT52. NT55 \u2192 t10 NT34 (rule 18). NT34 \u2192 t48 (rule 30). So NT55 produces t10 t48. NT52 \u2192 t63 (rule 12). So the production for NT21 is t10 t48 t63. The string starts with t2, which again isn't matching. So perhaps that's not the right path either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up NT21 and NT29. Let me confirm:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first part is NT29, which is t93 t20 t63. The second part is NT21, which is t10 t48 t63. So the first three tokens should be t93 t20 t63 t10 t48 t63. But the string starts with t2, which is not part of this. So this suggests that the string might not be derivable from S, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I need to check if the string can be broken down differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be tokenized in a different way. Wait, the string is provided with spaces, so each word is a token. The first token is t2, second is t97, third t72, etc. \n\nWait a minute, looking at the grammar, some NT symbols directly produce a terminal. For example, NT52 \u2192 t63 (rule 12). NT47 \u2192 t51 (rule... let me check. Looking for NT47: rule 23: NT47 \u2192 t51 (rule 22 is NT47 \u2192 t51?), wait rule 47 isn't clear in the initial problem. Oh, looking back, the user provided the grammar rules as lines. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t37 NT72 (rule 58)\nNT20 \u2192 t18 (rule 20: \"NT20 -> 't18'\")\n\nWait, for example, NT20 directly produces the terminal t18. Similarly, NT41 \u2192 't16', ND47\u2192 t51, etc. So some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be matched by a combination of these terminals. Let's look for where t2 appears. In the rules, NT52 \u2192 t63, NT47\u2192 t51, NT50\u2192 t16 (rule 40: \"50 -> 't16'\", rule 41: NT41 -> 't16'), etc.\n\nWait, where does t2 come from? Looking through the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 't20' (rule 58), and NT26 \u2192 't24' (rule something) and others. Wait, let me look for t2.\n\nLooking at the rules, does any NT directly produce t2? Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't23' (rule 33)\nNT38 \u2192 't35' (rule 38)\nNT58 \u2192 't20' (rule 58)\nNT50 \u2192 't71' (rule 50's production is something else)\nWait, elsewhere, rules like rule 33: NT33 \u2192 t23, rule 18: NT55 \u2192 t10 t48, and others.\n\nWait, looking at the string starting with t2, which is the first token. So perhaps t2 comes from an NT that directly produces it. Let's see if any NT in the given rules directly produce t2.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68 (rule 15: ...)\n\nWait, that doesn't produce t2. But looking for any rules where the production is t2 directly or through a chain. Wait, for example, let's see if NT59 can produce t2 somewhere.\n\nLooking at rule 49: NT59 \u2192 NT34 NT34 (rule 49: NT59 \u2192 NT34 NT34). Then, NT34 can produce t48 (rule 30: 34\u2192 48), or in other rules: for example, rule 33: NT33 \u2192 t23. \n\nWait, but I'm looking for t2. Perhaps in the string, t2 is produced by a non-terminal that eventually leads into t2. Let's see if any of the rules lead to t2.\n\nLooking for t2 in the rules:\n\nNT28 \u2192 't37' (rule 44: 28 \u2192 37 72?), No. Wait, looking at the initial rules, line 28: NT28 \u2192 't37' NT72 (rule \"28 -> 37 72\"). So it's two terminals: t37 and t72? Or is t72 a symbol? Wait, no, the production is NT28 \u2192 't37' NT72. So it's t37 followed by NT72.\n\nWait, in the string given, after t97 comes t72, which is 't72'.

{"custom_id":"request-886","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string in question is a sequence of tokens that look like identifiers (e.g., 't97', 't63').\n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF entails. CNF has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. Importantly, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions seem to fit this form. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals, and if they produce terminal symbols or other non-terminals, it could fit. Each production in the grammar either breaks down into two non-terminals or is a terminal. So, yes, this is indeed a CNF grammar.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is:\n\n`t97 t63 t80 t71 t15 t15 t63 t50 t72 t56 t87 t80 t18 t87 t97 t18 t24 t49 t20 t11 t48 t24 t73 t13 t97 t56 t87 t97 t93 t24 t13 t30 t51 t71 t63 t13 t16 t87 t15 t18 t63 t63 t15 t80 t24 t60 t13 t56`\n\nI notice that the string starts and ends with 't97', which seems significant. The string is a series of terminal tokens, and each of these tokens must correspond to the productions in the grammar.\n\nThe approach I should take is to parse the string step by step using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser would be appropriate. Alternatively, since the string is linear, I can check using a stack-based approach.\n\nBut since I don't have a parser in hand, maybe a better approach is to simulate the parsing or find a way to derive the string from the grammar.\n\nAnother method is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from a non-terminal, step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can try to identify which production rules output the given terminals.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, the first token is 't97'. I need to see which non-terminals produce 't97'.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41\n- NT41 \u2192 't16'\nWait, but NT59 can also produce 't93' via NT0. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, let me check the exact rules for each NT. Wait, maybe it's more efficient to build a map of which non-terminals can produce certain terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for each token and see which production rules can produce it.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this as a tree. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo the start is:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo the string must be generated by first getting NT29 NT21, which then produces all the tokens in the given string.\n\nSo each token in the string should come from either NT29 or NT21 or their further productions.\n\nBut let's take each token one by one and see if we can find a way to derive it.\n\nWait, the first token is 't97'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't97'.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- I see NT59 \u2192 't93' (no, 't93' is from NT0, which in another production)\nWait, wait, looking through the production rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side contains a terminal 't97'.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't97'?

{"custom_id":"request-880","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token either corresponds to a non-terminal or a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars have productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice a lot of non-terminals like NT26, NT20, etc., but eventually, some of them expand to terminals such as 't97', 't50', etc. My goal is to see if the provided string can be generated by starting with the start symbol, which seems to be S, as the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nThe string given is quite long: `t20 t91 t60 t33 t60 t35 t97 t71 t24 t73 t80 t16 t56 t50 t49 t93 t56 t20 t51 t49 t48 t48 t33 t2 t23 t93 t72 t13 t87 t87 t33 t50 t24 t23 t2 t87 t73 t51 t30 t90 t50 t87 t2 t71 t50 t60 t73 t24`. \n\nI'll start by mapping each token to either a terminal or non-terminal. Since the grammar goes into CNF, I can represent each production as a pair, and each token as either a terminal or non-terminal. For example, 't20' is a terminal, so it should correspond to a production that only has terminals on the RHS.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several non-terminals that produce terminals. Some examples are:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15' (Wait, that's a terminal, so NT19 produces 't15' which is a terminal. But in the string, I see 't15' appearing? Let me check the string. Oh, I don't see 't15' in the string. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, the string provided doesn't have 't15', so that might not be a problem. Let me look again.\n\nThe string includes tokens like 't20', 't91', etc. Let me see which non-terminals expand to these. For example, NT20 \u2192 't18' or 't72'\u2014but in the string, I see 't18'? No, I don't. Hmm. But maybe that's okay because the string doesn't need to include all possible terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe first step is to check if the string can be parsed using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string should be a sequence that can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string should start with the symbols that NT29 and NT21 expand to.\n\nLooking at NT29: From the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT48. Then NT48 \u2192 NT33 NT41. Let's see what NT33 and NT41 expand to.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34. NT29 is again NT48, and NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55. NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37. NT59 can be NT0 or NT1. NT0 doesn't expand, as it's a terminal? Wait, no\u2014wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals expand to terminals, like NT5 \u2192 't93'. Wait, no\u2014wait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't24', NT38 \u2192 't35', NT58 \u2192 't20', etc. So some non-terminals directly expand to terminals.\n\nWait, so I need to map each token in the string to a production. So for each token, check if it's a terminal or can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the grammar mappings:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18' or 't72' but in the string, I don't see 't18' or 't72' except 't20' which is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014NT20 can produce NT20 itself? No, looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. So NT20's production is to two non-terminals: NT2 and NT55. But that's not a terminal. So if the string has 't20', it would need to be an expansion where one of the non-terminals produces 't20', but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't20' except NT58. Wait, NT58 \u2192 't20' is a terminal. So in the string, any occurrence of 't20' must come from NT58.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the entries:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28, then NT52 \u2192 't63', NT28 \u2192 't20'. So NT58 \u2192 't63' 't20'? But wait, NT58's production is NT52 NT28, which then would produce 't63' and 't20'. But in the string, when I see 't20', it could come from NT58's expansion.\n\nWait, actually, in the string, I have 't20' appearing multiple times. Let me check if each can be explained by an NT derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string backward, ensuring each step follows the grammar rules. Starting from the end, each symbol must be either a terminal or derived from a non-terminal, which in turn is built from symbols on the right.\n\nBut this might get too time-consuming. Maybe another approach is to see if the string's structure follows the grammar productions.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is a context-free CNF, the parse tree must be such that each node has exactly two children, except for the leaves, which correspond to the input symbols. So the total number of symbols should correspond to a Catalan number, but perhaps not so important here.\n\nWait, since S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and both NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals, each should expand to a string that, when concatenated, forms part of the overall string.\n\nLet me try to walk through the string step by step, checking each token against the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt20, t91, t60, t33, t60, t35, t97, t71, t24, t73, t80, t16, t56, t50, t49, t93, t56, t20, t51, t49, t48, t48, t33, t2, t23, t93, t72, t13, t87, t87, t33, t50, t24, t23, t2, t87, t73, t51, t30, t90, t50, t87, t2, t71, t50, t60, t73, t24.\n\nThat's 43 tokens. To parse this, each step in the grammar must produce two symbols.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT48.\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nOh wait, this seems to loop between NT33 and NT48. But in the string, the initial part is 't20 t91 t60 t33 t60 t35 t97 t71 t24...' which includes 't20' after some steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has a specific structure where each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I should delve into parsing algorithms since the string isn't too long. Alternatively, I can try to derive the string step by step by breaking down from the start symbol and seeing if each part of the string can be matched.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t51 t13 t97 t51 t24 t80 t35 t71 t51 t50 t18 t60 t16 t30 t72 t91 t30 t2 t15 t49 t18 t73 t72 t16 t91 t60 t97 t71 t16 t87 t2 t16 t63 t30 t60 t33 t60 t51 t87 t73 t91 t48 t71 t49 t48 t56 t63 t73 t16`.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules for quick reference.

Now, the string consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't51', 't13', etc. So each token is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. Each of these must be expanded until they match the tokens in the string.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. The first token is 't51'. Looking at the grammar, 't51' is the expansion of NT51 (rule 51). So, to get 't51', the NT51 must be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT51 can be derived from NT59 and NT15 (rule 16: NT59 \u2192 NT15 NT59). Wait, but rule 16 is NT59 \u2192 NT15 NT59?

Wait, checking the list again:\n\nNo, looking back at the rules provided, I need to correct that.\n\nLooking at the list of rules, for example:\n\nRule 51: NT51 \u2192 't93' (from the list, rule 51)\nRule 33: NT1 \u2192 't73' (rule 33: actually, rule 33 is NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47, but rule 51 is NT1 \u2192 't73')\n\nSo for 't51', I need to find a rule where NT59 is transformed into 't51' or something else leading to 't51'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, 't51' is produced by NT1 when a certain production is used.\n\nWait, rule 51: NT51 \u2192 't93' (from the list)\nBut looking at the list, rule 51 is actually: NT1 \u2192 't93' (from the user's message, rule 33: NT1 \u2192 't73', rule 51 is NT51 \u2192 't93'), which is not possible because in the user's message, rule 51 is:\n\nNT51 \u2192 't93'\n\nYes, looking again:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't73' (rule 62)\nWait, I'm getting confused because the user listed the rules with numbers, but perhaps it's better to re-examine.\n\nWait no, let me count:\n\n1.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and the start symbol is also a non-terminal. Some terminals are allowed on the right-hand side as well, but usually, the left-hand side must be a single non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are from non-terminals to two non-terminals. However, some have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT52 \u2192 't97', which is a terminal. So this grammar does have terminals on the RHS, which is acceptable in CNF if it's allowed in their specific setup, though standard CNF doesn't have terminals as outputs. Wait, no, actually, in standard CNF for generating languages, all productions should be non-terminals, but if we're allowing terminals, then it's not a pure CNF. Hmm, but the question says it's a CFG in CNF, so perhaps the terminals are just part of the expansion without being further split.\n\nNext, I need to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: t48 t16 t13 t33 t18 t90 t24 t60 t48 t49 t93 t13 t48 t30 t15 t24 t72 t87 t30 t16 t56 t97 t73 t11 t48 t51 t93 t30 t18 t18 t49 t50 t18 t18 t15 t15 t51 t97 t24 t60 t93 t2 t60 t15 t23 t49 t72 t87 t16\n\nI notice that the string starts with t48, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals derive to t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT37, and NT93 is somewhere? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some terminals are given as individual symbols, like NT52 \u2192 't97', NT13 \u2192 't50', etc. So the terminals are specific tokens.\n\nSo I need to check if the first token t48 is generated by any non-terminal. Let's look for non-terminals that produce t48.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55, but that doesn't produce t48.

{"custom_id":"request-922","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each production splits into two symbols or a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the entire string should be derived from S. The string provided is a sequence of terminals like 't50', 't13', 't18', etc., which seems to be the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSince the grammar uses non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals (t followed by numbers), I need to check if the string can be built by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first few symbols to see if they align with any grammar rules.\n\nThe string begins with 't50 t13 t18 t33 t24 t18 t33 t60 t24 t35 t97 t51 t97 t91 t24 t2 t51 t13 t13 t18 t24 t56 t2 t49 t93 t97 t33 t11 t49 t56 t80 t60 t11 t15 t13 t48 t49 t51 t90 t56 t20 t30 t72 t24 t87 t33 t90 t13 t91 t60'\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nLooking at the first part: 't50' 't13' 't18' ... \n\nLooking at the grammar, 't50' is a terminal which appears in the production of NT1: NT1 \u2192 't70' NT47. Wait, no, looking back, NT1 appears in two places: NT1 \u2192 't70' NT47 and NT1 \u2192 't49' NT14 (though NT14 isn't listed here, but in the provided grammar, I see NT1 rules:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47\nNT1 \u2192 NT51 NT47\n\nNo, wait: let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47\nNT1 \u2192 NT51 NT47 (No, wait, actually, looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar provided has multiple rules, but it's a lot. Let me scan through for which non-terminals lead to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64. Then looking at NT72 and NT64: NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, and NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72? Wait, no: NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT65? Hmm, this might be getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar's rules, starting from the beginning. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the entire string must be a leftmost derivation, splitting into two parts each time.\n\nBut given the string, it's easier to work backwards using the reverse of the grammar, similar to how recursive descent parsers work. That is, we'll try to split the string into parts that match the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nWe'll look for possible splits where the leftmost symbol matches the first terminal of a production, then see if the remaining string can be split accordingly.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The entire string should be derived from S. So, S should split into NT29 and NT21. That means the entire string must be equal to the concatenation of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long list of terminals. So, to check if it's equal to NT29 followed by NT21, the string must be exactly the right-hand side of S's production.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21, which is two non-terminals. Since NT29 and NT21 are non-terminals, they each must expand into their own sequences of terminals.\n\nSo, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't50 t13 t18 t33 t24 t18 t33 t60 t24 t35 t97 t51 t97 t91 t24 t2 t51 t13 t13 t18 t24 t56 t2 t49 t93 t97 t33 t11 t49 t56 t80 t60 t11 t15 t13 t48 t49 t51 t90 t56 t20 t30 t72 t24 t87 t33 t90 t13 t91 t60'\n\nI need to split this string into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT29, and the second part is the expansion of NT21.\n\nLet's first see what NT21 and NT29 correspond to.\n\nFrom the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the string must be NT29 followed by NT21.\n\nNow, looking at the possible rules for NT21. NT21 is a non-terminal. In the grammar, looking for NT21:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\nAlso, checking the grammar, is there a production for NT21? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\nYes, that's one of the rules. Additionally, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, checking again, I think there are multiple NT21's. For example:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\nAlso, there's a line: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Wait, perhaps not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT21:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n\nYes, it's there.\n\nSo NT21 can be split into two parts: the first part is the expansion of NT55, and the second is the expansion of NT52.\n\nSimilarly, for NT29: where does NT29 appear in the grammar?\n\nNT29 appears in the rule for NT59:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nWait, or perhaps NT29 is a terminal?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the line: NT29 \u2192 't48' (from the given rules, yes, looking through: NT29 \u2192 't48'). Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72 (No, wait, NT65's rules: looking through, I see NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46. No, that's another path. Wait, perhaps I should list all the NT production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all non-terminals and their productions for clarity.

The string is quite long, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules. They all seem to be two-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, except for the non-terminals, which are combinations like NT47 or NT29, etc. I notice that the terminal symbols are mostly lowercase 't' followed by numbers, and a few are standalone letters like 't', 't2', etc. Additionally, some non-terminals are mapped directly to these t's with numbers, like NT0 -> 't93'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of these terminal symbols and numbers. I think the first step is to parse the string from left to right and see if it can be constructed using the given grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, it starts with 't91'. Let's see which rule produces 't91'. Scanning through the production rules, I see NT19 and NT39 produce t's with numbers, but none specifically. Wait, no, looking again: NT47 -> 't51', NT1 -> 't73', NT33 -> 't23', NT58 -> 't20', etc. Hmm, I might need to check all the rules.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\nNT52 -> 't63', NT59 -> 't58', etc. Let me look for a rule that directly maps to 't91'. Oh, here's NT24 -> 't24', but that's a self-reference. Wait, no, another rule: NT51 -> 't91'. Yes, that's a rule where NT51 is transformed into 't91'. So the first symbol 't91' could come from NT51.\n\nWait no, looking again: NT51 is one of the non-terminals, but the rule for NT51 is NT51 -> 't68' and maybe some other production? Or does any non-terminal directly produce 't91'? Let me check all the rules for NT: \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT51 -> 't68', NT59 -> 't58', NT50 -> 't71', NT52 -> 't63', NT90 is not a non-terminal, it's a terminal? Wait, the terminal symbols are like t91, t90, etc., so NT71 in the rules: NT71 -> 't90'. So 't90' comes from NT71.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't91', which comes from NT51. Let me check the production for NT51: the rules include NT51 -> 't68', and some production maybe involving other terms. Wait, I might have missed that. Let me scan all rules for NT51:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT51 -> 't68' and perhaps others? Or is it only that? No, from the list, the rules for NT51 are as follows: Wait, checking each line, I don't see NT51 being transformed into anything else. Only NT51 -> 't68' appears. Hmm, so that seems like a rule where NT51 can produce 't68' directly, but does it have any other productions?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the rules:\n\nNT51 -> 't68' and that's it. So, to produce 't91', maybe I need to look for another non-terminal that can produce 't91'. Wait, earlier I thought NT51 -> 't91' but I'm seeing now that it's NT51 -> 't68'. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check other rules.\n\nLooking for 't91' in the string, the first 't91' comes from NT51, which produces 't91' via some rule. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't91'.

Let me double-check: looking at the rules, there is a rule NT24 -> 't91'. So that means NT24 can produce 't91' directly. So the first symbol 't91' in the string can be generated by NT24. Then, the string is 't91' followed by 't90' and others. \n\nSo the initial step is to look for how 't91' is produced. Since it's from NT24, the first step in the derivation would be S -> NT29 NT21, but looking at the string, the first part is t91, so perhaps that's part of NT29 or NT21.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I have to determine if the given string `t48 t11 t15 t48 t63` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all the productions in the given grammar seem to fit this structure.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t48 t11 t15 t48 t63`, which breaks down into the terminals t48, t11, t15, t48, and t63. Since these are all terminals, each corresponds to a production that directly results in a terminal symbol in the final string.\n\nI need to work backward from the string to see if I can derive it using the given grammar. That means starting from the initial symbol S and applying productions until I reach the string.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. The string starts and ends with t48 and ends with t63. Looking at the grammar, t48 appears in several productions on the right-hand side of non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. But t48 could also come from NT58, NT59, etc. Let me check the productions where t48 is on the right.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t24, but NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, where t38 might result in t35. Hmm, perhaps I should look for terminals in the productions.\n\nLooking more closely, the terminal list includes t48, t11, t15, t48, and t63. Each of these must be the result of certain RHS productions.\n\nLet me check each terminal:\n\n- t48: appears in NT26 \u2192 t13 (t46?), wait no, actually, NT26 is t13? Wait, let me check the productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72\nNT24 \u2192 t24\nWait, but in the string, t24 isn't present, so that's irrelevant. t48 comes from which production?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 t93, NT58 \u2192 NT20 NT28\n\nWait, no, t48 is a terminal. Let me check where t48 is used.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t48\nNT26 \u2192 t13\nNT34 \u2192 t48\nSo, t48 could be derived from NT29 or NT34.\n\nSimilarly, t11 is in NT35, but I don't see NT35 in the grammar. Wait, looking at the terminals:\n\nt11 is part of NT5 \u2192 t93. So let me check:\n\nLooking at NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64. Wait, t5 isn't a terminal but a non-terminal. So, maybe t11 comes from another production.\n\nWait, the string is t48 t11 t15 t48 t63. So, let's think.\n\nLet me approach this by trying to build the string step by step.\n\nEach word in the string corresponds to a terminal, so perhaps each step in the derivation corresponds to expanding a non-terminal into words matching the string.\n\nLet's consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals: t48 t11 t15 t48 t63.\n\nThe length is 5, which means the depth of the derivation tree would be log2(5), but that doesn't directly help. However, in CNF, each production splits the string into two parts, so each step doubles the number of symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to reverse the process: start from the string and see if we can reduce it using the grammar's productions, working backward.\n\nThe idea is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar by applying inverse productions.\n\nStarting from the string: [t48, t11, t15, t48, t63]\n\nWe need to find a production that matches a part of this string.\n\nLooking for RHS that include the first symbol t48. Let's look for productions where the first symbol is t48 or the end symbol is t63.\n\nLooking at the RHS, t48 can come from NT29 or NT34.\n\nSimilarly, t63 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, t63 appears as a result of NT24 \u2192 t24 (no, t24 is another terminal) or wait, t63 is a result somewhere.\n\nWait, in the productions, nt24 \u2192 t24 (terminal) so if somewhere a production has t24 on the RHS, that could generate t24, but in our string, it's t48, t11, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt48: produced by NT29, NT34, etc. Let's check the productions for these.\n\nLooking:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t48\nNT34 \u2192 two productions: one ends with t48 (from NT29?), let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 and another \u2192 t48? Let me confirm:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for NT34:\n\nYes, NT34 has two productions: NT64 NT55 and t48.\n\nSo, NT34 \u2192 t48 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nSo, t48 could be derived from either NT29 or NT34.\n\nSimilarly, t11: Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals derive to t11.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT producing t11. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The terminals include t11, t15, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the productions, I don't see a non-terminal that directly produces t11. Let me check each production:\n\nNo, I think t11 comes from NT5 \u2192 t93, but wait, t93 isn't in the string. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps t11 is derived from a production that isn't directly a terminal but from a series of steps. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 t71 t68. So, t15 could come from NT15.\n\nSimilarly, t11: looking at the grammar, does any non-terminal directly produce t11? From what I see, in the productions, t11 comes from NT59 \u2192 NT52 t37, and NT50 \u2192 something. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, let's be systematic. For each terminal in the string, find possible non-terminals that can derive to it.\n\nt48: from NT29 or NT34.\n\nt11: looking for any production that ends with t11. In the grammar, do any NT produce t11? Looking over the productions, I don't see a direct one. Or perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking for NT where the RHS could derive to t11.\n\nLooking at NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT58 t37. NT58 \u2192 t52 t28. t52 isn't in the string, so probably not.\n\nLooking at NT50: NT50 \u2192 something. Wait, NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24, which are both non-terminals. t64 and t24 are terminals? No, t64 is 't64' in the string? Wait, no, in the string, the terminals are t48, t11, t15, t48, t63. So perhaps I need to check if any non-terminals produce these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at each step.\n\nLet me try to build the string from the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21 (since in CNF, each production must split into two non-terminals)\n\nSo, the string starts as t48 (from NT29) followed by what? Then another NT21. NT21's production is either 't18' or 't20' via NT21 \u2192 t18 or t20.\n\nBut in our string, after t48 comes t11. Since NT21 can only produce t18 or t20, but the string has t11 and t48, this doesn't align. So perhaps I took the wrong production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT59 NT65.\n\nWait, S can be NT59 NT65. Then NT59 \u2192 t48 something? Let me check NT59's productions.\n\nLooking up NT59: NT59 can produce either NT58 t37 or t10 NT26 or t1 t13.\n\nWait, wait, in the production list,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Starting with the start symbol S, which is S -> NT29 NT21. So, every string derived from S must start with NT29 followed by NT21. The given string starts with t48 t93, which matches the start because NT29 is t48 and NT21 is t93, as per the terminal definitions provided.

Let's look at each symbol:\n\nLooking at NT29, in the terminal mappings, it's defined as 't48'. Similarly, NT21 is 't93'. Wait, no, hold on.

The string to check is `t48 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t60 t97`. Hmm, that's a sequence of tokens consisting of these abbreviations. \n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. CNF has all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals and each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions. So, I should probably start by breaking down the string step by step, checking if each part can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t48, t56, t2, t73, t50, t2, t15, t60, t97. Each of these is a terminal symbol, and I need to see if they appear in the grammar. Wait, let's check the productions for terminals:\n\n- Looking through the grammar, I notice lines like NT59->t2, NT19->t15, etc. Notably, t48 is a terminal in NT24's rule: NT24->'t48'. Similarly, t56 is in NT65->'t56'. So the first two tokens can be produced directly. t2 is in NT26->t24? Wait, wait, looking at NT2-> 't73', yes. So the third token t2 is NT2.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the third token is t2, which corresponds to NT2, so yes, that works. Let me write down which non-terminals produce each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t48 \u2192 NT24 (as per NT24\u2192't48')\n2. t56 \u2192 NT65 (as per NT65\u2192't56')\n3. t2 \u2192 NT2 (as per NT2\u2192't73')\n4. t73 \u2192 NT1 (as per NT1\u2192't73')\n5. t50 \u2192 NT50 (as per NT50\u2192't71' but wait, no\u2014wait, looking at the grammar, NT50\u2192't71'? Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, line NT50: 't71'? No, wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake. Let me check where NT50 is defined. Oh, wait:\n\nIn the grammar, there's NT50: NT50->'t71', but that can't be right because t71 is a terminal, but in the string, we have t50. So wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see ND50: NT50->'t71' and NT19->'t15'. Wait, but the string has t50. So where is t50 produced? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the given productions, there's a rule NT50->'t71', which suggests that t71 is produced by NT50. But in the string, we have t50. So wait, is there a production for NT50->'t50'? Or is this a mistake?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, I see NT50: NT50->'t71', but I don't see a rule for NT50->t50. So how does t50 appear in the string? Hmm, perhaps I need to check if there's a rule that directly produces t50 or if it's derived from non-terminals.\n\nWait, the string given is `t48 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t60 t97`. Let me list each token and see where they come from:\n\n1. t48 \u2192 NT24\n2. t56 \u2192 NT65\n3. t2 \u2192 NT2\n4. t73 \u2192 NT1\n5. t50 \u2192 ?\n6. t2 \u2192 NT2\n7. t15 \u2192 NT17 (since NT17->'t15'; checking the grammar, yes, NT17: 't15')\n8. t60 \u2192 NT26\n9. t97 \u2192 NT24? Wait, NT24\u2192't48' as per earlier. But wait, t97 is another terminal, so which non-terminal produces it?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar for 't97':\n\nLooking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that goes directly to 't97'. Hmm. That might be a problem because 't97' would need to come from a non-terminal, but if none produce it, then perhaps it's not present. But that can't be because the string includes it. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has a rule for 't97'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nBTW, in the grammar, line NT20: 't18' (so NT20\u2192't18'), and line NT59: 't0' as NT59\u2192't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked a production for 't97'. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nWait, no rule directly produces 't97' from any non-terminal. So that suggests that the string contains a token 't97', but none of the non-terminals in the grammar have a production rule to that. That would mean the string cannot be derived, thus the answer would be 'No'. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread a rule. Let me go through the productions again to see if any non-terminal goes to 't97':\n\n- NT24\u2192t48\n- NT26\u2192t24\n- NT37\u2192t2\n- NT34\u2192t60\n- NT2\u2192t73\n- NT59\u2192t0\n- NT72\u2192t65\n- NT46\u2192t51\n- NT15\u2192t71\n- NT59\u2192t50\n- NT65\u2192t56\n- NT5\u2192t93\n- NT39\u2192t46\n- NT58\u2192t20\n- NT20\u2192 t18\n- NT20 appears again in another rule: NT20\u2192t72\n- So all these seem to directly go to various terminals.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see any line where a non-terminal is directly converted to 't97'. So that's a problem because the string contains 't97', but there's no production rule for it. Therefore, 't97' cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case because perhaps 't97' can be derived through multiple steps. Maybe there's an indirect production. Let me think: If 't97' is the result of a two-step production, perhaps a non-terminal that produces another non-terminal, which in turn produces 't97'. But looking at the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that can produce 't97' directly or through other non-terminals. Because all rules end with terminals or other non-terminals, but none end with 't97'. \n\nSo, if the string contains 't97', and there's no rule in the grammar that allows for 't97' to be produced, then the answer should be 'No'. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any production. Let me scan through the rules again. There's a rule NT59\u2192't50', but nothing\u2192't97'. So 't97' is not present as a terminal in any production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Maybe the string is structured in a way where 't97' is part of a longer production. But each token in the string is a single terminal. So each token must be derived directly from a single production rule. So, 't97' must come from a non-terminal that directly has a rule 't97', which doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't97' in the string means that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-94","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t48 t56 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t48 t63`, and the grammar is in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Or was it that all RHSs are two non-terminals? No, wait, in CNF, it's either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Because CNF requires that all productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the grammar provided has many productions that look like A \u2192 a B or A \u2192 B C where a is a terminal, but some have two terminals on the RHS, like S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Wait, that's S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So here, S is replaced by two non-terminals. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nThe string we have is `t48 t56 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t48 t63`. So it's a list of terminals. Each terminal in the string needs to be matched through the grammar's productions.\n\nI think a good approach here is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the given string in a step-by-step manner. Alternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can break it down into smaller parts or find a way to parse it using the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar's productions and see how the terminals appear. Each production either starts with a non-terminal and leads to two other symbols (either terminals or non-terminals).

Hmm, that might be conflicting. Or perhaps it's just a different production, but it's unusual. But in this case, I think 't72' is allowed, but also 't18' is an option. So for NT20, when expanding, it can produce either 't72' or 't18'. That might complicate things, as some strings can have a mix of different options, but since the given string has 't72' in there, perhaps that's the correct path.)\n\nNow, let's try to see how the string can be built. Each terminal in the string must match the RHS of a production.\n\nLooking at the first part: `t48 t56 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\n- t48\n- t56\n- t2\n- t93\n- t20\n- t2\n- t33\n- t48\n- t63\n\nSo let me note each of these. Now, let's see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t48 comes from NT34 \u2192 t48, as per the rules. So to get t48, NT34 must be somewhere in the string.\n\n- t56 comes from NT65 \u2192 t56, as seen in the rules.\n\n- t2 comes from NT37 \u2192 t2, which is correct.\n\n- t93 comes from NT5 \u2192 t93, or NT51 \u2192 t87, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, NT51 \u2192 't87', so that's not. But NT5 \u2192 't93' and NT34 \u2192 't48', but also NT26 \u2192 't13' and so on. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT5's rule: NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64. So that doesn't lead to a terminal directly. Wait, but looking at NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15, and NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68, etc., maybe that's too deep. Alternatively, maybe the non-terminals that produce terminals are those where the RHS includes a terminal. So for example, NT59 \u2192 't97' when it has 't97', but also other productions like NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26, which is two non-terminals. So that might end up as a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string using the given grammar.\n\nLet me start by trying to split the string into smaller parts that might correspond to terminals produced by the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, the entire string is 9 tokens long. Let me see if I can find a way to split it.\n\nLooking at the first part: t48. That could come from NT34 \u2192 t48, or possibly other rules, but in this case, yes, NT34 can produce t48. So perhaps the string starts with NT34.\n\nWait, but wait: NT34 has rules either as two non-terminals or 't48'. Let me look at NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 or NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60, etc. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, NT34's RHS is either NT64 NT55 or NT34 \u2192 't48'. So that's correct. So the first part is 't48', which is produced by NT34. So the grammar would expand NT34 to 't48'. So that matches the first token.\n\nNow, the string becomes: t56 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form is like a standard way of structuring these grammars, right? Each production rule either produces two terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or maybe a non-terminal and a non-terminal, I think. Wait, though, isn't it that each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal?\n\nWell, looking at the grammar provided, sure enough, every production seems to be either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. So that checks out. Now, the string I need to evaluate is: `t48 t11 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t48 t63`. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think it's a good idea to parse the string into its components. Since it's a sequence of tokens, I can list them out step by step: t48, t11, t15, t93, t20, t2, t93, t33, t48, t63.\n\nNow, the grammar's starting symbol is S. So I need to see if the string can be generated starting from S. Let's see the production rules for S. The first rule is S -> NT29 NT21. So S breaks down into NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, NT29 and NT21\u2014I assume NT stands for non-terminal, so these are non-terminal symbols like NT29 and NT21. Now, I need to see if each of these can be expanded into sequences of terminal symbols that, when combined, match parts of the string.\n\nLet me make a tree starting from S. Let's see: S -> NT29 NT21. So the string starts with NT29 and ends with NT21. Let's check what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT29 is involved in few rules.

So these are the leaves in the parse tree. \n\nLooking at the first production, S->NT29 NT21. So the string needs to consist of the expansion of NT29, followed by the expansion of NT21. Let's examine how each of these non-terminals expands.\n\nStarting with NT29: Looking through the rules, NT29 appears in NT33 -> NT29 NT34 and also in NT59 -> NT33 NT41. Wait, no, checking again, looking for production rules where NT29 is on the left. Scanning the list, I see:\n\n- NT59 -> NT33 NT41\n- NT33 -> NT29 NT34\n- So, there's a cycle here between NT33 and NT59. Hmm. So maybe NT29 is involved in a loop.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t48. So looking at NT29 -> something that includes t48. From the rules, looking for where NT29 has a terminal. Hmm, I don't see a direct rule for NT29 except in some productions where it's a non-terminal. Wait, looking for any rule where NT29 is the only non-terminal, but not a larger part.\n\nWait, maybe I can trace back from the string tokens. Let's take the string and see if it fits the production.\n\nWait, perhaps building the parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nLet me start by looking at the entire string. The first symbol is t48. Looking through the grammar, some NT symbols expand to t48. Let me check where NT29 appears, because t48 is the first token.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT29 appears in NT59's production: NT59 -> NT33 NT41.\n- And NT33's production: NT33 -> NT29 NT34.\n\nSo there's a cycle between NT59 and NT33, with NT29 being somewhere in there.\n\nWait, could it be that NT29 can't directly produce a terminal, but instead is part of a chain? Or maybe I'm missing a production for NT29. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all rules, I don't see any rule where NT29 directly produces a terminal, except perhaps in some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Looking again, only NT1 through NT19 and some with 't's, but for NT29: In rules:\n\n- NT59 -> NT29 NT34.\n\nSo, if NT29 can be part of a longer chain, perhaps it's hard to generate t48 starting with NT29, because NT29 itself isn't a terminal. Alternatively, maybe I need to see if another non-terminal can start with t48.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t48, let's look at what produces t48. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT29: in NT59 -> NT29 NT34, which has t48 as part of NT29's expansion. Wait, but NT29 is a non-terminal and doesn't expand to a terminal here.\n\nWait, perhaps NT33 can expand to t48. Let me check NT33: production rule is NT33 -> NT29 NT34. And NT29 is used here. Hmm, but there's a rule NT59 -> NT33 NT41, so NT33 depends on NT59, which in turn depends on NT33 again. This is a recursive loop.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that directly expands to t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I need to evaluate is `t48 t11 t33 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t60 t63`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK parser, more efficient. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's indeed in CNF since all the productions are either non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or terminals on the right, or a terminal. Some of them produce terminals directly, like `NT24 -> t24`. So the structure is suitable for a CYK algorithm if needed.\n\nThe string to be checked is a sequence of terminals: `t48, t11, t33, t93, t20, t2, t93, t33, t60, t63`. The goal is to see if this sequence is part of the language generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step, trying to break it down into the grammar's rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation is straightforward; each step of the derivation starts from the start symbol S and builds up the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first thing produced by S is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. So the string should be built from these two parts. \n\nI should check if the given string can be split into two parts that each can be generated by NT29 and NT21, respectively. \n\nBut before that, I should note that the string has 10 terminals. Since each production in CNF introduces at most one terminal per step, the derivation will take multiple steps, but each expansion of a non-terminal will contribute either a terminal or another non-terminal. \n\nLet me list out the string tokens: t48, t11, t33, t93, t20, t2, t93, t33, t60, t63. So 10 tokens, which is an even number isn't necessarily required because some productions can expand into two non-terminals, each needing to be expanded further.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation tree is binary. Starting from S, which expands to NT29 NT21, each of these could further expand down the tree. \n\nBut since our string has 10 tokens, which is an even number, it might require a binary expansion each time. Since 10 tokens can be built up from a binary tree with height 3 (since 2^3=8, which is less than 10, but maybe more). Wait, perhaps not exactly, but each level adds nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to break the string into smaller chunks and see if each can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet's try to consider the entire string as the concatenation of two parts, each part generated by NT29 and NT21, respectively. The string would then be split into two segments: the first few tokens from the front (let's say k tokens) for NT29, and the remaining 10 - k tokens for NT21. We need to find a k where this split is possible.\n\nI need to find a way to split the string such that the first part can be derived from NT29 and the second part from NT21.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to work backwards. Sometimes, starting from the end of the string can help identify which non-terminals could generate those terminal tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT51 \u2192 t51 (but wait, in the given grammar, NT51 is actually set to t87. Wait, looking back: yes, under NT51\u2192't87'. Similarly, other NTs produce terminals like NT34\u2192t48, NT28\u2192t72, NT5\u2192t93, etc. So many of the symbols directly expand to terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the given string is built by a mixture of terminals and these non-terminals that directly map to certain terminals.\n\nBut wait, some NTs map to two-terminals, like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So to use these, each of NT0 and NT58 themselves must expand into something else, possibly further.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map each terminal in the string to a corresponding NT that directly generates it, or perhaps they are part of a chain of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into sub-strings each starting with some NT that expands to the corresponding part.\n\nLet me see.\n\nLooking at the last token in the string: t63. Let's see what non-terminals produce t63. Looking through the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 t24, NT52 \u2192 t63, NT26 \u2192 t13, etc. Oh, NT52 \u2192 t63. So, t63 is directly produced by NT52. So in the string, the last token is t63, which comes from NT52. So somewhere in the derivation, we would have to have NT52 as a non-terminal, which produces t63.\n\nGiven that, the last token being t63 suggests that in the last step of the derivation, NT52 is used. So the previous step(s) must have generated something that leads to NT52 as the last step before the terminal. But since in CNF each step can only produce one terminal or two non-terminals, perhaps in this case, the production for NT52 is simply \u2192 t63, so in that case, in the derivation, just t63 is added without any non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if NT52 can produce t63, which is a terminal, that's acceptable. So in that case, in the string, t63 would be a terminal derived from NT52.\n\nSimilarly, the second last token is t60, which is given by NT33\u2192t60, as seen in the grammar: NT33\u2192t60. So in that case, t60 is produced directly by NT33.\n\nSo perhaps the second last token is t60, which comes from NT33, and the last token is t63 from NT52. But since the string's last two tokens are t60 t63, and t60 is from NT33 and t63 from NT52, but how do they connect?\n\nWait, maybe the last two tokens are generated by a single NT that expands to t60 t63. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces t60 and t63 together. So perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, the two may come from two different NTs on either side, but that would mean that at some point, the derivation splits into two paths: one generating the earlier part and another generating the latter part.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me take a step back.\n\nI think the process of checking the string is similar to verifying that it can be produced by a CFG in CNF using a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, the top-down approach (like the CYK algorithm) is efficient, but maybe for a smaller string, a manual parse can be done.\n\nAlternatively, the fact that the grammar is in CNF might mean that the string must have a structure where each production either terminates or breaks down into two parts. So let's see.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the entire string must consist of the concatenation of the expansion of NT29 and the expansion of NT21.\n\nTherefore, the string must be the result of expanding both NT29 and NT21, with their combined expansions forming the string. So the string is a sequence where the first part is generated by NT29 and the second part by NT21.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: the first half and the second half. The total length is 10 tokens, so the split could be after 5 tokens: first 5 tokens from NT29 and last 5 from NT21. Alternatively, any split point could be considered.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see what each NT29 and NT21 can generate.\n\nLet's look at NT29.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT33 NT48. So NT29 expands into two non-terminals: NT33 and NT48.\n\nNow, looking up NT33 and NT48:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This structure is helpful because parsing algorithms for CNF grammars, like the CYK algorithm, can be used to determine membership efficiently.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t56 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a sequence of terminals, each presumably corresponding to a production rule in the grammar.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar's S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT29 should produce t48, and NT21 should produce t18. Therefore, the string should start with t48 t18, but it starts with t48 t56. That's a discrepancy. Wait, looking back at the string, it's `t48 t56 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t33 t48 t63`. Hmm, so the second token is t56, which seems off because NT21 is supposed to be t18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which non-terminals correspond to the terminals. Let me list all the non-terminals and their respective productions to see if the string can be built up step by step.\n\nBut this might take a long time, so let me think strategically. Maybe I can build the parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can derive back to S.\n\nThe string is: t48, t56, t2, t87, t20, t51, t50, t2, t33, t48, t63.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the entire string must be a sequence of productions from NT29 and NT21, and their sub-productions.\n\nLet me represent the string as tokens for easier handling:\n1. t48\n2. t56\n3. t2\n4. t87\n5. t20\n6. t51\n7. t50\n8. t2\n9. t33\n10. t48\n11. t63\n\nStarting with the first token, t48, which comes from NT29 (since NT29 \u2192 t48). So the first part of the derivation is NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nBut the second token is t56, which needs to come from NT21 because S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT21 must produce t56. But looking at the grammar for NT21, does it produce t56? Let me check.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 has production: NT21 \u2192 t18. So NT21 produces t18, not t56. That's a problem because the second token is t56, which can't come from NT21. Therefore, this suggests that the string is not compatible with the grammar because the second symbol should be t18, not t56.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check again. I see that NT21's only production is \u2192 t18. So any occurrence of NT21 in the derivation must result in t18. Therefore, the second token must be t18. But the string has t56 instead, which suggests that it's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path where NT21 can be derived into t56 through a series of productions. Let me check the grammar for NT21. It only has NT21 \u2192 t18. So there's no way for NT21 to produce anything else. Therefore, the entire string starting with t48 t56 can't be derived from S because S needs t48 (NT29) followed by t18 (NT21).\n\nThis seems like a clear contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with `t48 t56`, but according to the grammar, the second terminal should be `t18` due to NT21's production. Since `t56` doesn't match, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

It's a long list, so I need to make sure I go through each non-terminal and see how it can expand to the terminals in the string.\n\nStarting from the end of the string, the last symbol is `t63`.

But 't15' is a terminal, so that's not a direct production. Wait, no\u2014looking again, is there a production for NT19? Wait, no, NT19 is not in the production list as a two-sided.

Let me approach this differently.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step, working backwards.\n\nThe string is: t48, t11, t15, t93, t33, t24, t35, t2, t93, t15, t60, t63.\n\nLet me write it in reverse order to see the breakdown easily.\n\nReverse order: t63, t60, t15, t93, t35, t24, t33, t2, t93, t15, t11, t48.\n\nI'll go token by token and see if each can be matched by a production.\n\nStarting with t63: production is NT52 \u2192 t63.\n\nSo, the first token in reverse is t63 \u2192 NT52.\n\nNext, the previous token in the original string is t60. So in reverse, after NT52, the next is t60.\n\nLooking at t60, I see in the productions that NT60 \u2192 t49. Which is 't49', so not 't60'. Wait, checking the productions:\n\nNT60 is not listed as a terminal. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't93', NT34 \u2192 't48', NT0 \u2192 't93', NT50 \u2192 't71', NT68 \u2192 't30', etc. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each terminal in the reverse order and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to attempt to build the parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string. That might be more straightforward.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the string starts with t48, which is produced by NT29 \u2192 t48. So the first symbol t48 comes from NT29.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT29 ... , and NT29 \u2192 t48, so now we have to match the rest of the string after t48.\n\nThe rest of the string after t48 is t11, t15, t93, t33, t24, t35, t2, t93, t15, t60, t63.\n\nWait, that's 12 tokens. So, after NT29 \u2192 t48, the next production should start with NT21.\n\nWait, the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so after t48, we have t11, which would come from NT21.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So, if the next symbol is t11, but how? Because NT21 produces two non-terminals, which need to be expanded into t11 and the next symbol.\n\nWait, but t11 is a terminal. So, does any non-terminal produce t11?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't93', NT25 maybe? Wait, no. Wait, NT5 \u2192 't93'. Not t11.\n\nWait, looking for a production where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't11'. Looking through the list: not directly, but perhaps via a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nTerminals in the string: t48, t11, t15, t93, t33, t24, t35, t2, t93, t15, t60, t63.\n\nLooking at each terminal and seeing which non-terminals can produce it:\n\n- t48: NT29 \u2192 t48.\n- t11: I don't see a direct production; so perhaps it's through NT... Wait, looking through the productions, NT51 \u2192 t20, NT5 \u2192 t93, etc. Wait, maybe NT11 is not a non-terminal but a terminal. Oh, wait no, in the productions, the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals or terminals. So, to get a terminal like t11, it must be the terminal directly from a production.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces 't11'. So that would mean that the string cannot be generated, right? Because the grammar doesn't have a production for 't11'.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through, the NT19 \u2192 t15, but I don't see NT with t11 as a production. Similarly, t24, t35, etc.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nIn the productions, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is replaced directly by 't11'. For example, looking at NT0 \u2192 't93', NT2 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo, if the string has a 't11' token, but there's no production that allows a non-terminal to produce 't11', then it's impossible to derive 't11'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The grammar's productions don't include any non-terminal that produces 't11' directly. So yes, the string contains 't11', but no non-terminal can generate it, making the entire string un derivable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, since 't11' is present in the string and there's no production that allows a non-terminal to generate 't11', the string is not in the language of the given grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a production.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and some symbols are terminals (like the words with 't' followed by numbers) and non-terminals (like the NT... and S). \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to use these rules to derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this sequence. Let's see what each rule allows.\n\nStarting with S, the production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with t48 (since NT29 likely produces t48) and then NT21, which might produce t2 (since NT21 is in the rules). Wait, looking at the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Hmm, that's more steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them. For example, t48 appears early. Looking at the grammar, I see NT48 doesn't exist, but NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT15. Hmm, but that's not directly t48. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the NT symbols are in the grammar, but the terminals are the 't' strings.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of productions where some symbols like NT59, NT65, etc., are non-terminals, and others like 't97' are terminals. So each NT production leads to other NTs until it reaches a terminal. My task is to see if the entire string can be formed by recursively splitting it into parts based on the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string again: t48 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t15 t13 t2 t15 t48 t63.\n\nI'll number them for clarity: 1 t48, 2 t2, 3 t56, 4 t2, 5 t2, 6 t93, 7 t15, 8 t13, 9 t2, 10 t15, 11 t48, 12 t63.\n\nWait, let's look at each step.\n\nThe start is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with NT29 producing t48 and NT21 producing t2.\n\nLooking at NT29, its production is NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT15. Hmm, but that's not directly a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again. Wait, in the grammar, NT29 is produced by NT59 NT15. Wait, that's not directly a terminal. So NT29 must be a non-terminal that eventually produces t48. So maybe NT29 \u2192 ... something that gives t48.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see a production where NT47 \u2192 NT15 NT65, and somewhere else NT47 \u2192 t51? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, the terminal 't51' is there, but does NT47 produce t51? Yes, in the list, there's NT47 \u2192 t51. Wait, no, actually, looking back: Oh, in the list, under NT5: S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and under NT5: It's not the same. Wait, looking at the grammar, the exact productions are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\nNT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nSo, none of the NTs directly produce a 't' except for where the list says NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, but that's not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think. Each NT production either results in a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. So to produce a terminal like t48, there must be a rule that leads NT... to t48. \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72, which is still two NTs. But for some non-terminals, right-hand sides are just terminals. Wait, in the provided rules, I think I should check for any non-terminals that directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the rules, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 doesn't produce a terminal. But in the grammar, is there any rule where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal? Let me search:\n\nAh, I see here: \n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34: not a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the user provided a list of rules, but I think maybe I need to go step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to parse the string from right to left, using the grammar, but that might be more efficient. Alternatively, maybe I can apply the production rules step by step to see if I can derive the string.\n\nWait, given that the start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which, according to the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT15 and NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So the string would need to begin with the terminal sequences produced by NT29 and NT21.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t48. So let's check for NT29 producing t48. Looking at NT29: does any rule produce t48? Let's see the rules for NT29. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see a direct production of NT29 to a terminal, but perhaps it's derived via other non-terminals. So maybe it can't directly produce t48.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar list, each line is a production. So in the list, the first line is:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT15 NT65\n\nWhich may not directly produce a terminal. Whereas I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. Let's check the list carefully.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT25 doesn't exist in the list, but in the user-provided rules, some NTs produce terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72: Not a terminal.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55: Not a terminal.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34: Not a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the rules one by one:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNo.\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n\nNo.\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\n\nNo.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n\nNo.\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n\nNo.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n\nNo.\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60\n\nNo.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNo.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n\nNo.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n\nNo.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68\n\nNo.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41\n\nNo.\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46\n\nNo.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n\nNo.\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT20 NT28\n\nNo.\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT5 NT19: Hmm, not a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that none of the rules in the provided grammar produce a terminal. All non-terminals are replaced by two other non-terminals, or combinations. So does that mean the grammar can't produce any terminal at all?\n\nIf that's the case, then the string provided, which contains multiple 't's, can't be generated by the given grammar. Because all the non-terminals don't have a production leading to a terminal; each production leads to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's see if any of the NT...s directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the list again, the production NT51 \u2192 't87'. Oh, here it is: NT51 \u2192 t87.\n\nSimilarly, NT53 doesn't exist, but NT19 \u2192 t15? Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking for any line where the right side is a single 't' followed by a number. \n\nYes, here's one: NT51 \u2192 t87. Another is NT19 \u2192 t15?

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to decide if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand what a grammar in CNF looks like. CNF is defined such that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal followed by two non-terminals, like A \u2192 a B C, where 'a' is a terminal. However, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let me see if it follows CNF. The start symbol is S, and it has a production S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So that's two non-terminals, which is fine. Then I see other productions, for example, NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15, which again is two non-terminals. NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72, another two non-terminals. Wait, some of the productions, like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, also two non-terminals. But then I notice that some non-terminals have terminals on the right side, such as NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, etc. Wait, no, actually, looking back, the grammar includes terminal symbols like 't97', 't50', etc. So in CNF, it's allowed to have terminals on the right side as well, but each production must have exactly two symbols. So any production that has a terminal and a non-terminal, like A \u2192 a B, is acceptable as it's a terminal followed by a non-terminal\u2014wait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a terminal followed by nothing? No, I think in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side: either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and then maybe nothing, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the right, but one of them can be a terminal, so A \u2192 a B is allowed because it's a terminal followed by a non-terminal, making two symbols in total. So in our case, looking at the grammar, I need to check if each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, for example, the production NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58: that's two non-terminals, so that's fine. NT59 is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side has two non-terminals.\n\nAnother production: NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47. Again, two non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string to evaluate: `t48 t11 t15 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t15 t60 t97`.\n\nThis is a sequence of terminal symbols, each representing a token like t followed by a number. So I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nTo do this, I can try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, it should be possible to use the CYK algorithm, but since the string is short, perhaps a top-down approach with backtracking would work. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the possible productions for each non-terminal. But that might take a while because the grammar is extensive. Instead, perhaps I can look at the terminal symbols in the string and see how they might correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t11 t15 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t15 t60 t97.\n\nThat's 13 symbols. I need to see if this can be split into a structure that matches the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the beginning. The first symbol is t48. I look through the grammar to see if any production starts with a terminal followed by two non-terminals, but wait, in CNF, productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal? Or is each production supposed to be exactly two symbols on the right-hand side, which can include a terminal and a non-terminal?\n\nWait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. So, for example, a production A \u2192 a B is allowed, where 'a' is a terminal.\n\nBut looking back at the given grammar, the productions all have the form either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. For example, NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 is two non-terminals. NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64 is two non-terminals. But wait, there's a production like NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which is fine. Wait, but I need to check if any production has a terminal on the RHS. Let me look through the grammar.\n\nI see NT29 \u2192 NT48 NT21. Hmm, NT48 and NT21 are non-terminals, so that's fine.\n\nWait, no, NT29 is a non-terminal, and on its production are two non-terminals: NT48 and NT21. So each production is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, in the given grammar, I think all the productions have only non-terminals on the RHS, except perhaps for some that have terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I don't see any production where a terminal is on the RHS except in the last part. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72: both non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production is of the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are terminals or non-terminals. Also, S is the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only terminals I see are labeled with 't' followed by some number. So the string consists of a sequence of these terminal symbols. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll check the structure of the grammar to see how it can produce strings. Since it's in CNF, the length of the derived string for any non-terminal will be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. But that's more about the grammar's structure than the specific string.\n\nI think a good approach here is to try to parse the string using the CFG. I'll see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nStarting with the first two symbols: t48 t93. Let's look at the grammar for NT's that can produce t48 and t93.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT59 -> t93 t? (since NT59 has a production to NT0 and NT58, but NT58 is another non-terminal)\nWait, actually, I need to look at the productions involving NT59. Let's see:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58. So the production for NT59 is two non-terminals. But the string is t48 t93. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps there's a production for NT that directly gives t48 and t93.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for non-terminals that can produce t48 or t93 as their terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I can find NT29 -> t48, NT13 -> t50 (which isn't relevant), NT5 -> t93, and NT34 -> t48, among others.\n\nWait, I see NT29 -> t48. So if I can find a production that leads to NT29, that's a start.\n\nLooking for NT29, the productions are:\n\n- NT29 -> t48\n- NT59 -> ... etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the first t48 comes from NT29. Then the second symbol is t93, which would need to come from another non-terminal connected to NT29.\n\nWait, but the first production for S is S -> NT29 NT21. So the string starts with NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait no, the initial string is t48 t93... which would correspond to S's first production: S -> NT29 NT21. So S splits into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nThen NT29 -> t48, which matches the first symbol t48. Then NT21 needs to derive t93.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: NT21 -> NT55 NT52 and also there's NT21 -> t18. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I have:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\nNT21 -> 't97'? Wait, no, checking back, the last line is NT21 -> 't18'? Or wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT21 having a production with 't97' yet. Let me scan the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT21: I see `NT21 -> NT55 NT52` and elsewhere, perhaps not. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe given grammar has:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\nNT21 -> 't18'? No, I don't think so. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the last production is NT21 -> 't18'. Let me check: yes, I see 't18' as one of the productions, no, looking:\n\nHold on, the grammar lines are:\n\nNT24 -> 't24'\nNT38 -> 't35'\nNT58 -> 't20'\nNT20 -> 't18'\n...\nLooking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't13'\nNT65 -> 't56'\nNT5 -> 't93'\nNT34 -> 't48'\nNT0 -> 't93'\nNT50 -> 't71'\nNT52 -> 't63'\nNT24 -> 't24'  [I think this might be an error, but perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed.\nNT38 -> 't35'\nNT58 -> 't20'\nNT20 -> 't18'\nNT20 -> 't72' [Wait, looking at the provided grammar, is there a production for NT20 that produces 't72'? Yes, second line: NT20 -> 't18', and another? Let me check.\n\nYes, in the given grammar, NT20 appears twice:\n\nNT20 -> 't18'\nNT20 -> 't72'\n\nSo, NT20 can produce either 't18' or 't72'.\n\nWait, but earlier in the string, after t48 comes t93, so NT29 produces t48, and then there's t93. So maybe the NT21 produces t93. But in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT21 that produces a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, is there a production for NT21 that leads to a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I don't see NT21 having a direct terminal production. So maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to decompose the string step by step, considering that each non-terminal can split into two, leading to the terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to write the given string in terms of the non-terminals. The string is t48 t93 t33 t11 t33 t91 t20 t48 t2 t11 t33 t48 t97.\n\nLet's try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me think in reverse, perhaps, trying to find the terminals and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is 13 tokens long. Since in CNF, every split is into two, the maximum length is 2^n. 2^3 is 8, 2^4 is 16. So 13 might be in the middle. But this method is a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to split the string into sections that can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 can directly produce t48, so the first symbol matches. Then NT21 needs to produce t93. But in the grammar, I don't see NT21 producing t93. So maybe this path is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with another production. Let me check the productions for S again: S -> NT29 NT21. So S must split into these two non-terminals.\n\nSo the string must be a concatenation of two parts: NT29's derivation and NT21's derivation.\n\nNT29 must produce a string that starts with t48, which it does directly. Then NT21 must produce a string that starts with t93.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT21 does not have a production to t93 directly. So perhaps NT21 must split into two non-terminals that can eventually produce t93.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: it can produce NT55 NT52 or possibly 't18', but in reality, from the given grammar, I don't see NT21 having a direct terminal.

Let me break this down step by step. First, I'll try to understand the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21, which means the start symbol S generates two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. Each of these non-terminals is defined by other rules, and eventually, they lead to terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of these terminal symbols: `t48 t11 t15 t93 t15 t60 t97 t24 t50 t2 t11 t33 t48 t97`. The length is 14 symbols, meaning the derivation will have multiple steps, possibly a branching factor since it's in CNF.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That means each production step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or terminals. So, starting from S, the first step would produce two non-terminals, and each of those can produce two more, leading to a binary tree structure.\n\nThe string has 14 symbols, which is even, but I need to see if each terminal is correctly generated by the grammar. I'll try to map the string back to the grammar by seeing which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLet me list all the production rules for each non-terminal to see their possible terminals and other non-terminals they can generate.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT21. So the string must be a combination of the strings generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29 is defined by NT29 -> NT59 NT15. So NT29 can generate two non-terminals, NT59 and NT15.\n\nNT59 can produce multiple options, including NT0 NT58, NT33 NT41, etc. Let's look at the string:\n\nThe first symbol is t48.

{"custom_id":"request-198","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is `t48 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t33 t23 t16 t2 t93 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components, which are tokens like `t48`, `t56`, and so on. Each token is a terminal symbol, so I'll need to see if the grammar can produce these in the correct order.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that some of the terminals correspond directly to non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals. For example, `NT5` produces `t93`, which matches the token `t93` in the string.\n\nLet me outline the steps the grammar might take to produce the string:\n\n1. Starting with the start symbol S.\n2. S -> NT29 NT21 (from the first production)\n3. Then, each of NT29 and NT21 would expand into sequences that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nI'll try to match the string step by step. Let's start with `t48 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t33 t23 t16 t2 t93 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t48`. In the grammar, `NT24` produces `t64`, but there's a production for `NT59 -> NT29 NT34`, and `NT34 -> NT64 NT55`, and `NT64` produces `t59`, which then further breaks down. Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the grammar, `NT29` could produce `t48` because there's a rule like `NT29 -> NT59 NT21`, and perhaps NT59 eventually produces `t29`, but wait, `NT29` can produce `t28`, no. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nChecking for `t29`: in the provided grammar, I see `NT33 -> NT29 NT34`. So `NT29` can lead to `t29` indirectly. But in the string, the first token is `t48`, so maybe `NT24` is involved because `NT24` can produce `t48` somewhere?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, `NT24->NT10 NT57`, and `NT57->NT68 NT2`. Hmm, that might not directly produce `t48`. Alternatively, `NT29` is involved in `t33` because `NT33->NT29 NT34`, and `NT29` might eventually produce `t48` if `NT59` produces it. Let me check.\n\nWait, `NT59` has rules like `NT59->NT0 NT58`, `NT59->NT58 NT50`, etc. And looking at `NT0`, it's `t93`. Also, `NT0` might lead to other terminals, but perhaps `NT59` can produce `t48` through some other path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe `NT24` can produce `t48` through other rules, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should draw out the parse tree step by step. Let's try to match the string.\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt48, t56, t2, t73, t50, t2, t33, t23, t16, t2, t93, t33, t48, t63.\n\nSo that's 14 tokens. Each token is a terminal.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the first expansion would be S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, I need to see how these non-terminals can produce the string.\n\nLet's look at NT29: according to the grammar, NT29 can produce what? Let me check the rules. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a direct rule for NT29 leading to t48. Instead, I see that NT59 has a rule NT59->NT29 NT34.\n\nSo perhaps NT29 is part of a larger production. Maybe NT29 is part of a larger tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the tokens in the string and see if they match directly or through longer sequences.\n\nLooking at the first token t48, I need to see if any non-terminals can produce t48 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that `NT59->NT33 NT41` and `NT33->NT29 NT34`, and `NT41->NT2 NT36`, which then can lead to other terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t48, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT34->NT64 NT55,\n\nNT64->NT59 NT37,\n\nNT59->NT0 NT58,\n\nNT0 is t93, so t93 is directly produced by NT0.\n\nBut t48 is in the string, so perhaps NT59 can lead to t48 through some expansion.\n\nWait, if I follow the rule: NT34->NT64 NT55, and then NT64->NT59 NT37, which then NT59->NT0 NT58 (t93), and then NT37->t2.\n\nSo perhaps NT34 can produce something leading to t48? Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see which non-terminals can directly produce certain terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, any NT that has a production where one of the symbols is a terminal? Let's list all the NTs that have a rule where a terminal is involved:\n\n- NT65->NT37 NT72 (and t56 is produced by NT5?)\nWait no, let me look through each rule:\n\n- NT28->NT37 NT72 (but 37 and 72 may not produce t28, or no)\n- NT70->NT51 NT36 (no)\n- NT24->NT10 NT57 (no)\n- NT41->NT2 NT36 (no)\n- NT59->NT0 NT58 (t93 and t58)\n- NT55->NT10 NT34 (no)\n- NT58->NT52 NT28 (no)\n- NT57->NT68 NT2 (t2 is nt2, but if NT2 can produce t2... Wait, no. NT2 is `t70` and `t47`, no. Wait, looking for rules where a terminal is in the right-hand side.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A->BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that if a terminal is present, it's in a single step.\n\nWait no, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a single terminal. But in this grammar, all the productions seem to be two non-terminals on the right, not a terminal. So perhaps each production in this grammar results in two non-terminals, which can further expand, until we reach a terminal.\n\nWait that can't be, because in CNF, the right-hand side must consist of exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So perhaps I'm misreading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is presented in a way where some rules have two non-terminals on the right, except for some that have a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, the given grammar doesn't seem to have any rules that produce a single terminal. For example, NT28->NT37 NT72 (non-terminals only). All the rules have two non-terminals or perhaps a terminal?\n\nWait, looking again, for example, `NT59-> NT0 NT58`\u2014both NTs. Similarly, NT50-> NT64 NT24\u2014non-terminals. \n\nWait, all the productions have two non-terminals on the right side, except perhaps some\u2014no, looking further, perhaps `NT50-> NT71 NT65` is another rule. So it seems that every production in this grammar is of the form NT -> NT NT, with no terminals on the right side. That would mean the only way a terminal can appear is through the process of expansion, but perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the right-hand sides have terminals after expansion. For example, `NT5->t93`, `NT36->t20`, etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-211","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. It's a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. All rules are binary except for the terminals. This form is useful for simplifying the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze and sometimes for parsing.\n\nNow, the given grammar has various productions, mostly between non-terminals, with some terminals appearing on the right-hand side of rules. My task is to determine if the string provided can be generated by this grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t73 t50 t90 t30 t50 t2 t11 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nI notice that most of these symbols end with 't', indicating terminal symbols. Some, like 't48', 't20', 't50', are likely to be directly derived from non-terminals, but I'll need to see how the grammar can produce these.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I'll need to check if the non-terminals in the grammar can produce each of these terminals through their productions.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t48, t11, t15, t87, t20, t73, t50, t90, t30, t50, t2, t11, t33, t48, t63. I'll go through each and see if there's a production rule that directly yields them.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t48: There's a production NT34 \u2192 t64 NT55, but also NT34 \u2192 t48. Wait, no, looking again: The grammar has NT34 -> t46 NT2, NT38 -> t20 NT34, NT34 -> t58 NT64? Wait, no, in the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT34 has several productions. Checking:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 (I think)\n- NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT60\n- Wait, actually, let's go through the production list.\n\nAh, here's NT34: It has productions like NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55, NT34 \u2192 NT58 NT60, and others. But also, does it have a production with terminal t48? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the production NT47 \u2192 t51 NT36, NT21 \u2192 t55 NT52, NT33 \u2192 t29 NT34, etc. Wait, I think I'm looking at NT34. Wait, lines like:\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\nNT34 -> NT58 NT60\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55 (wait, that's a duplicate? Maybe a typo)\nThen later, NT34 -> t46 NT2\nWait, no, looking again, the productions after NT34 are:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nI see ND34: \n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\nNT34 -> NT58 NT60\n...\nWait, looking more carefully, I think the rule for NT34 is:\n\nLooking at the production starting at NT34: \n\nLine starting at NT34 is:\n\nNT34 -> t48 NT60\nWait, no, let me list the relevant productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT34 -> t48. Wait, no, let's check each production for NT34:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\nNT34 -> NT58 NT60\nOther NT34 productions: No, I don't see a direct t34 terminal. So perhaps t48 is derived from NT34: Is there a production where NT34 \u2192 t48? Let me look:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT34 in the productions:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t64 NT55\n- NT34 \u2192 t58 NT60\n\nWait, am I missing another production? Wait, maybe I missed a line.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the lines after NT34:\n\nNo, I don't see any direct t48 in NT34. But wait, the user's grammar includes a NT34 -> t48 NT60? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, let's search the entire grammar for t48. The string includes t48 several times.\n\nLooking at:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT10\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36\n- NT50 -> NT64 NT24\n- NT41 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT33 -> NT29 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT62 -> NT1 NT24\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT59 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- NT1 -> NT20 NT60\n- NT65 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- NT71 -> NT10 NT65\n- NT52 -> 't97'\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't80'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT41 -> 't16'\n- NT26 -> 't13'\n- NT65 -> 't56'\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n- NT34 -> 't48'\nAh, there we go.

Wait, maybe it's derived from a chain.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, looking for terminals:\n\n- NT5: can't see NT5 \u2192 t11. Let's check NT19: Yes, NT19 \u2192 t15. NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34, which is 't48' as above.\n\nWait, another non-terminal, looking for NT10. Let's see NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which is NT5 \u2192 t93, and NT19 \u2192 t15.\n\nWait, perhaps the chain is NT10 \u2192 t93 t15. So if we have t11, maybe it's another non-terminal that directly produces t11.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me try another approach: the string is in a certain order, so each element must appear in the order of the grammar. Maybe the entire string needs to be a parse tree where each node is a production.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string, assuming we start from the top-level rule.\n\nThe initial rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols after a possible initial NT must be NT29 followed by NT21? Wait, the string starts with t48, which comes from NT34. But S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So if NT29 is the first symbol, but in the string, the first symbol is t48, which is derived from NT34. Maybe the initial S is producing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can only produce one tree, so let's see what S produces.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21.

Let's see what S is. Looking at the grammar, S -> NT29 NT21. So S must start with NT29 and then NT21.\n\nLet me check the string. The first part is 't48 t90...'. Let's look at the productions for NT29 and NT21.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT29 appears in two places: NT47 -> NT59 NT15 and NT59 -> NT0 NT58. But that doesn't directly help with NT29. Wait, I need to see if there's a production for NT29.\n\nWait, searching the grammar for NT29, I see that in one place: NT33 -> NT29 NT34. Also, NT25 might not be present, but I don't see NT29 being on the left side except for NT33 and NT24. So NT29 is a non-terminal that can produce NT29 NT34 (I think). Or wait, NT29 is used as a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is 't48', so that's a terminal. So perhaps NT29 can produce 't48'.\n\nWait, checking the grammar productions, I see NT29 -> 't48'. Yes, in the productions, under 'NT29', there's a rule NT29 -> 't48'.\n\nSo starting with S -> NT29 NT21, which would produce 't48' followed by whatever NT21 produces.\n\nNext, let's parse the rest. So after 't48', we should have the output from NT21.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 -> NT55 NT52. So we need to parse that part now.\n\nThe string is: t48 t90 t30 t71 t11 t49 t11 t15 t2 t73 t50 t2 t33 t60 t97.\n\nAfter 't48', the next tokens are t90, t30, etc. Let's take the first part after 't48', which would be t90, t30, t71... Wait, no. Because NT21 is the next part, which is NT21. Let me see how NT21 breaks down.\n\nSo NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nLooking at NT55: in the productions, I see NT55 -> 't10'... wait, no. Let me check. Yes, in the productions, NT55 -> NT10 NT34. Wait, but I see that for NT55, there's also NT55 -> 't10'?\n\nWait, actually, no, looking back, under NT55: NT55 -> NT10 NT34. I don't see any direct terminal 't55'. Hmm, let's check again. Oh, under NT24, there's NT24 -> 't24', but in NT58's production, I see NT58 -> 't52'... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, in the given productions, under NT55, it's NT55 -> NT10 NT34. Also, there might be a production for NT10, which is NT10 -> 't5' or something? Wait, no, looking at the list, I see: NT10 -> 't5' in one place, maybe? Let me check: Wait, under NT68 it's NT68 -> 't22' etc., wait, but looking through, under NT55, the production is NT55 -> NT10 NT34, and NT10 is a non-terminal that might produce a terminal.\n\nWait, NT10 appears here: NT10 -> 't5' under one production. Let me look: the productions include NT10 -> 't5'; yes, under NT10, the rule is NT10 -> 't5'. So NT10 is a terminal that outputs 't5'. So NT55 is NT10 followed by NT34, which is a production. And NT34 can produce 't60'.\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nTake NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, the string after S (which is 't48') is: t90, t30, t71, t11, t49, t11, t15, t2, t73, t50, t2, t33, t60, t97. So after 't48', the first part is 't90', which is likely from NT21.\n\nNT21 produces NT55 and NT52. So let's see how these break down.\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34. Now, NT10 is 't5', and NT34 is 't48'? Wait, no. Wait, under NT34, we have two productions: NT34 -> 't48' and NT34 -> 't60'.\n\nWait, in the string, starting after 't48', the first term is 't90', but wait, that's the next token. Hmm, this seems confusing. Let me take a step back.\n\nLet me outline the entire parsing process step by step.\n\n1. The entire string is: [t48][t90][t30][t71][t11][t49][t11][t15][t2][t73][t50][t2][t33][t60][t97].\n\n2. The grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\n   So, S must produce t48 (from NT29) followed by the production of NT21.\n\n3. NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\n   So, after t48, we have the production of NT21, which is NT55 and NT52.\n\n   Now, in the string, the next token after t48 is t90. Let's see what t90 could correspond to.\n\n   Wait, actually, the tokens are in order, so after t48, the next is t90. Let's think: T21 is followed by NT21 production, which is NT55 and NT52. The first part is NT55.\n\n   NT55 is NT10 NT34.\n\n   Now, in the string, after t48, the following tokens are t90, t30, etc.\n\n   Let's see if t90 follows NT55. Wait, NT10 is 't5', and NT34 can be 't48' or 't60' depending on the production.\n\n   But t90 isn't directly produced by any of these. So perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe I should look for each production and see if they can parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a parsing approach such as recursive descent or another method would be better, but since this is a bit time-consuming, maybe I'll try a different way.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 -> 't48', so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo now, after t48, we need to parse the remaining tokens (from t90 onward) as the production of NT21.\n\nNow, the production of NT21 is NT55 NT52.\n\nLet's parse that into the string. So after t48, the next tokens should be the production of NT55 followed by NT52.\n\nNT55 is NT10 NT34.\n\nSo, the next step is to parse NT55 (which is NT10 NT34) and then NT52.\n\nNT10 is a terminal 't5'.\n\nSo, the first token after t48 is t90, but that can't be 't5'. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So maybe NT55 is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me try a different approach: try to parse the entire string step by step, using a stack or something.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order: t48, t90, t30, t71, t11, t49, t11, t15, t2, t73"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the steps required.\n\nFirst, the grammar seems to consist of several non-terminals (like S, NT29, NT47, etc.) that can be rewritten into other non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals produce terminal symbols (t*) or other non-terminals. My goal is to parse the given string through these non-terminals to see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, I'll need to match this string against the productions of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is `S -> NT29 NT21`. So, the first step is to expand S into NT29 and NT21. Each of these non-terminals must be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\n1. `t48`, `t71`, `t80`, `t93`, `t63`, `t2`, `t56`, `t2`, `t2`, `t48`, `t60`, `t16`, `t2`, `t15`, `t60`, `t63`.\n\nI'll need to see if each of these terminals is produced by the respective non-terminals when expanded. Let me list out the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\n- `NT59 -> NT0 NT58` but also `NT59 -> t93` (Wait, let me check the grammar again. Looking down, I see `NT59 -> NT10 NT26` and `NT59 -> NT1 NT13` and `NT58 -> NT52 NT28` etc. It seems that NT59 isn't directly producing terminals except in specific cases. Hmm, maybe I should look for which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look for non-terminals that have productions ending in terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals go directly to terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> 't93' (so NT5 -> t93)\n- NT29 -> 't48' (NT29 -> t48)\n- NT60 -> 't49' (Wait, looking at the grammar: NT60 -> 't49'?) Hmm, NT60 is a terminal, yes.\n- NT48? Wait, no, looking back, I see NT24 -> 't24', NT26->'t13', and so on. So any non-terminal that has a production to a terminal is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> t93\n- NT29 -> t48\n- NT26 -> t13\n- NT47 -> t51\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26, but also NT59 -> NT1 NT13\nWait, no, let me scan the grammar again. Oh, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have multiple productions, some of which produce terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need to identify which non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26 and others, but also NT59 -> NT1 NT13 (so NT59 has two productions that don't directly produce terminals except in cases where the right-hand side includes a terminal.)\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to find the rightmost non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by building the string from the start symbol, expanding non-terminals step by step, trying to match the string.\n\nLet's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t48 t71 t80 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63`.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the first two symbols should be derived from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t48. Let's check if NT29 can produce t48. From the grammar, yes: NT29 -> 't48'.\n\nSo, NT29 becomes t48, and the remaining string is: t71 t80 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63.\n\nNow, the next step is to expand NT21. Looking at the grammar, NT21 can be rewritten as 't18' or 't72'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT21 has a production: NT21 -> 't72'? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar rules:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT21 -> 't18'? No, let me check the provided grammar. Looking at the list, I don't see NT21 directly producing t18, but instead, NT21 has a production `NT21 -> 't21' NT21`? Wait, no, let me re-read.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT47 NT15.\n\nWait, no. Wait, I need to look carefully.

Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, for example, NT21 -> NT55 NT52?\n\nWait, according to the provided grammar, yes:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo, NT21 can expand into the non-terminals NT55 and NT52.\n\nNow, looking back: the current remaining string after t48 is t71 t80 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63.\n\nWait, hold on, after S expands to NT29 (t48) and NT21, so the first symbol is t48, and the second part is NT21, which is to be expanded into something. The next symbol after t48 should come from the expansion of NT21.\n\nWait, but the total string is sixteen symbols, so the expansion would require that each step leads to the correct sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to parse the given string using the grammar. Let me see if I can find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 -> t48, so the first symbol is t48, which matches.\n\nNow, the next step is to expand NT21 into NT55 and NT52. So NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nLooking at the next symbol in the string: it's t71. So NT55 must produce t71.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t71?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT50 has a production to t71.

Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar consists of a series of these rules, and the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terms like 't48', 't93', etc. My goal is to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's analyze the grammar and see which non-terminals produce which terminals. I notice that many rules end with a terminal. For example, NT24 -> 't24', NT26-> 't13', etc. So, some of the non-terminals immediately produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the structure, S starts with NT29 and NT21. So, S can be broken down into NT29 and NT21, which then each go through their own productions.\n\nLet me write down the string in order:\n1. t48\n2. t93\n3. t20\n4. t2\n5. t24\n6. t80\n7. t48\n8. t60\n9. t16\n10. t2\n11. t73\n12. t50\n13. t2\n14. t15\n15. t48\n16. t63\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the grammar step by step. Let's start with S, which is NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29: From the grammar, NT29 -> NT0 NT58. So, NT29 can produce NT0 and NT58.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, t48 comes before t93. Wait, no, the string starts with t48, but wait, S is NT29 NT21. So S -> NT29 NT21, so the first symbols should be NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of terminals, so it's generated by the leftmost derivation. So, the order of application matters.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nStart with S = NT29 NT21.\n\nLooking at the first part: NT29 must produce t48. Let me check NT29's productions. Looking through the rules, I see NT29 -> NT0 NT58.\n\nSo, for NT29\u2192 t48, we need NT0 to produce t48. From the rules, NT34->t48, and NT47->t51, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t48 as the first symbol. So perhaps NT0 produces t48? Or maybe NT29 produces something else that leads to t48.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol is S. So S can derive NT29 NT21, so the first step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nFrom NT29, we can choose a production. If NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, then the next step would be NT0 NT58 NT21.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT29 can produce t48 directly? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT29 directly producing any terminal. So NT29 must go through some productions that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the given productions, for example, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, to get to t48, perhaps one of these non-terminals needs to produce t48.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT34 \u2192 t48 is one of the productions. So, if we have NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and then NT0 or NT58 produce terminals.\n\nWait, NT0 \u2192 NT0? No, let's see NT0's productions. From the rules, I don't see NT0 producing anything except in other rules, like NT59\u2192NT0 NT58. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to parse the string from the grammar using top-down parsing or look for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated by working from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the first symbols should be the first symbols of NT29 and NT21.\n\nFrom NT29's productions: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, the first part of the string should start with NT0 and NT58, which produce t48 (if NT0 is t48) or some other term.\n\nWait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for 't48' in the rules. From the rules, NT34 \u2192 t48. Also, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, so if NT0 is NT34, then NT34 would produce t48.\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT34 appears in several places, for example, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 is one of the rules, then NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT72, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of all non-terminals and their possible terminal productions.\n\nLet's go through each non-terminal and see if it can directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' (Yes)\n- NT26 \u2192 't13'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48' (Wait, is there a rule for NT29\u2192t48? Looking back: NT29 is only in the production of NT34\u2192NT29 NT59. Hmm, no, I don't see NT29 directly producing a terminal. Then how does it end up as 't48' in the string? That's confusing.\n\nWait a second, maybe I've missed something. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nWait, the rules are given as S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and then many other rules.

{"custom_id":"request-251","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules seem to fit this structure, so moving on.\n\nThe given string is: `t48 t11 t15 t23 t16 t2 t11 t15 t23 t11 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t60 t63`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. One common approach for this is to perform a leftmost derivation, where we start from the start symbol and try to expand non-terminals step by step until we reach the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first step is to replace S with NT29 NT21. Now, we have two parts to consider: NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions, I see that NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So, replacing NT29, the string becomes NT0 NT58 NT21. Next, I need to look at NT21. NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So, replacing NT21, the string becomes NT0 NT58 NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, I need to handle each of these non-terminals:\n\n1. NT0: Looking at the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't93'. So, NT0 becomes 't93'.\n2. NT58: From the productions, NT58 \u2192 't20'. So, NT58 becomes 't20'.\n3. NT55: NT55 \u2192 't93'. So, NT55 becomes 't93'.\n4. NT52: NT52 \u2192 't63'. So, NT52 becomes 't63'.\n\nPutting it all together, the string after replacing S is: t93 t20 t93 t63.\n\nWait, that's four tokens. The input string has 17 tokens. That's way fewer. So, maybe I need to find another path in the derivation.\n\nPerhaps I should backtrack and see if I can expand other non-terminals. Let me consider the initial step again: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Maybe I should expand NT29 differently. Looking at NT29, the productions are:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 and NT29 \u2192 't48'. So, I could choose to replace NT29 with 't48', which would immediately produce 't48' as the first token.\n\nIf I do that, then S becomes 't48' followed by NT21. Let's see what that gives us.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Let's expand NT55 and NT52:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't93'.\nNT52 \u2192 't63'.\n\nSo, expanding NT21 gives us 't93 t63'.\n\nPutting it all together, the string starts with 't48 t93 t63'. Comparing this with the given string, which starts with 't48 t11 t15...', it's different. So this path doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand NT29 with NT0 NT58 and then expand NT58 further.\n\nWait, but NT58 \u2192 't20', which is a terminal. So, I can't expand NT58 further; it just becomes 't20'. So, the string would be 't93 t20' from NT0 and NT58.\n\nBut I need to check if this string can be transformed into the given string. Since the given string begins with 't48', which corresponds to the production NT29 \u2192 't48', maybe I should consider that path again.\n\nSo, starting over, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. If I replace NT29 with 't48', the next step is to replace NT21.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Let's replace NT21 with 't93 t63', so the string so far is 't48 t93 t63'.\n\nThis only produces three tokens, but the input string has 17. That suggests that after replacing S, I need to expand further non-terminals to get more tokens. Since the current expansion only gives three tokens, which is way less than 17, I must have gone wrong somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to expand both NT29 and NT21 further to get more tokens. Let me try to expand NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. NT0 \u2192 't93', NT58 \u2192 't20'. So, this gives 't93 t20'.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. NT55 \u2192 't93', NT52 \u2192 't63'. So, that gives 't93 t63'.\n\nCombined, S \u2192 't93 t20 t93 t63' (four tokens). But the given string is 17 tokens. That suggests that perhaps some non-terminals are used to generate more tokens, possibly through multiple expansions.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe some non-terminals can produce multiple terminals, and thus generate longer strings. So, perhaps I should look for possible chains where a non-terminal can be expanded into a sequence that contributes more tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals produce other non-terminals and terminals, which might allow for deeper expansion.\n\nFor example, looking at NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT15 NT65. Then, NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68, and NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46. Let's see where that takes us.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe it's better to look for a specific path that could generate the given string.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt48 t11 t15 t23 t16 t2 t11 t15 t23 t11 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t60 t63.\n\nLet me parse this string as a sequence of tokens and see if they can correspond to a possible derivation.\n\nThe first token is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, only NT29 \u2192 't48' and maybe others? Let me check the grammar:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT15 NT65: doesn't produce a terminal at the top level.\n- NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34: also doesn't produce a terminal.\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58: doesn't produce a terminal.\n- NT58 \u2192 't20' (a terminal). So, NT58 is the only non-terminal that directly leads to a terminal in this way.\n\nWait, so for the first token 't48', it must come from NT29 \u2192 't48'. So, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which becomes 't48 NT21'.\n\nThen, I need to expand NT21. Let's see what the next token is: 't11'. So, 't11' must come from NT21's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT21, it can be replaced by NT55 NT52. So, 't11' must come from NT55 or NT52.\n\nLooking at NT55 \u2192 't93' (terminal) and NT52 \u2192 't63' (terminal). Wait, so NT55 and NT52 directly produce terminals. But in the string, after 't48' comes 't11', which is a terminal. That suggests that one of the options for NT21's expansion must produce 't11'.\n\nBut from the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Both NT55 and NT52 are terminals, 't93' and 't63', respectively. So, the only possibility is that NT55 or NT52 produces 't11', but looking at their productions:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't93' (only terminal is 't93').\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't63' (only terminal is 't63').\n\nNeither of these produce 't11', which is in the string. So that suggests that the second option is not possible, meaning that if the second token is 't11', it cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the first token is 't48' (from NT29 \u2192 't48'), the second token must come from NT21, which is either 't93' or 't63', but the given string has"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like many of the non-terminals are breaking down into other non-terminals and some are terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and NT21 \u2192 't97', NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 18 tokens, all of which are either two-digit numbers or some like 't' followed by a number. Since the grammar uses 't' terms to represent terminal symbols, I'll treat those as terminal tokens.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string through a series of production rules.\n\n1. Starting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n   - So, S needs to derive into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n   \n2. Let's look at NT29: From the grammar, I see NT29 \u2192 NT48 't11'. Because 't11' is a terminal, and NT48 can further break down as NT48 \u2192 NT34 't2'. Then NT34 \u2192 NT64 't55'. NT64 breaks down into NT59 't56'. Then NT59 can be NT10 't93' or NT1. Let's see which path makes sense.\n\nWait, NT59 here is in the initial step: S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and NT29 is NT48 't11' which is NT34 't2' which is NT64 't55' which is NT59 't56'. So the first part of the string starts with t48, t11, t15, t93. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see each production step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: 't48', 't11', 't15', 't93', 't63', then several 't2's, then 't56', 't2's again, 't11', 't33', 't48', 't63'.\n\nWait, let's try to parse this string into the structure of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the first two symbols must come from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't48'. From the grammar, NT29 can produce 't48' if it's via NT48 \u2192 NT34 't2', and then NT34 \u2192 NT64 't55', and so on. Wait, but NT29 in the grammar is defined as NT48 \u2192 NT29? Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and then other rules. So, NT29 is actually another non-terminal that breaks down into other non-terminals and terminals. Wait, looking back, the rule for NT29 is: NT29 \u2192 NT48 't11'. That's interesting.

{"custom_id":"request-275","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided. I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has two main rules: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit since all the productions either have two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t2 t2 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t2 t72 t49 t50 t2 t15 t48 t63`.\n\nI notice that it's a sequence of terminals, which suggests that the string is a series of terminal symbols. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me write down the grammar rules to have a clear picture. Each rule starts with a non-terminal and produces two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72 (and there's another production for NT26)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n- NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37\n- NT65 \u2192 NT15 NT65 (this seems interesting; it could be a loop)\n- NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\n- NT26 again \u2192 NT24 NT38\n- NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- And so on.\n\nI also see that some non-terminals produce terminals directly, like NT40, NT57, etc. Maybe these are the leaf symbols in the parse tree.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. I need to reconstruct a valid parse tree where each terminal in the string is generated by a production that terminates.\n\nI think the first step is to start from the start symbol S and see how the string can be built. Let's see what S produces. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S generates two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t48`, which is a terminal. So for S to produce `t48`... Hmm, wait, S produces two non-terminals, so the entire string must be the sequence generated by NT29 followed by NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it's t48 ... followed by t2, t2, etc. So perhaps NT29 produces t48 and NT21 produces something else. Let me check the productions for NT29.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55, NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34, etc. Wait, I should look for NT29. Let me scan the rules:\n\nAh, wait, NT24 \u2192 NT91 (I think that's a typo, maybe NT24 \u2192 t91?), but no, looking back, I see NT24 has rules like NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34, etc. Wait, actually, NT29 is not directly mentioned in the given rules. Wait, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking again: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68, etc. I don't see NT29 in the provided rules. Hmm, but wait, maybe I misread.

Specifically, the ones where the production ends with an 't' and a number. These are the leaves of the parse tree. So, the string must consist of a sequence of these terminals, and the parse must follow the productions accordingly.\n\nThe string provided is: t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t72 t49 t50 t11 t15 t56 t30 t50 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 18 tokens. So, each production step reduces the number of non-terminals by one, because each production rule takes two non-terminals and replaces them with something else until terminals are produced.\n\nStarting from S, which is two non-terminals. So for a string of length 2^n, but here the string has 18 tokens. Hmm, 18 is not a power of two, which might complicate things, but perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's possible through left or right derivations.\n\nWait, no, the number of terminals in any derivation must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is determined by the start symbol. Each production step increases the number of non-terminals or decreases them depending on the direction.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t48. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce a terminal starting with t48?\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t48 (grammar says NT29 as the production for NT29 is t48). Wait, no. In the list under NT29, I see NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 t13, NT24 \u2192 t24, etc.\n\nSo looking at the string, the first token is t48, which must come from NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and t48 is produced from NT29, so the first part is derived from NT29 being replaced by t48, and the NT21 part remains.\n\nWait, but NT21 may be part of the production as well. So S is produced as NT29 NT21. But in the string, after t48 comes t11, which is the second token.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't11'. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT51 \u2192 t87, NT58 \u2192 t20, NT55 \u2192 t10, etc. Wait, no 't11' is directly produced. Wait, looking at the list, I see NT5 \u2192 t93, NT34 \u2192 t48, NT24 \u2192 t24, NT26 \u2192 t13, etc. Wait, is there a production for 't11'? Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the list: NT5 is 't93', NT24 is 't24', NT26 is 't13', NT34 is 't48', NT37 is 't2', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't11' as a terminal. Wait, the first token is t48, then t11. So the second token is t11, which would need to be produced by some NT.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the list again.\n\nIn the given grammar rules, I see some lines like NT33 \u2192 't23', NT58 \u2192 't20', NT65 \u2192 't56', NT5 \u2192 't93', etc. But where is 't11'?\n\nWait, after t48 (from NT29), t11 is the next token. So t11 must come from some non-terminal production. Looking through the list, none of the NT produce 't11' directly. Is that a problem?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the productions. Let me scan the list again.\n\nWait, in the list, under NT1, we have NT1 \u2192 't73'. NT20 \u2192 't18', 't72', etc. NT5 \u2192 't93'. NT57 \u2192 't68' and 't2'. NT70 \u2192 't51' and 't36'.

Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) looks like. In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's helpful because it can simplify parsing, but I'm just trying to check if a string is generated, so I might not need a specific parsing algorithm unless it's too big.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Let me try to list them all out mentally or maybe jot down the key ones. It might be easier if I look for terminals in the string and see how they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t2 t2 t71 t80 t11 t15 t13 t2 t2 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t15 t60 t63`.\n\nI notice that the string has multiple tokens, each presumably being a terminal. Let me list them one by one and see which production they come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- I see rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal (like S, NT29, etc.) and the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals or two terminals, but since it's in CNF, only two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, for each 't' token in the string, I need to see which production they come from. But wait, some terminals might correspond to multiple non-terminals. So, for each token, I should check if it's a terminal in the grammar. But looking at the grammar, most of the right-hand sides have two non-terminals. The exceptions are when they produce terminal symbols. Wait, the rule NT52 -> 't63', NT24 -> 't24', etc. So, indeed, the terminals are sometimes used in the productions as the RHS.\n\nSo, each 't' token in the string must be the result of a production step where that non-terminal's production includes a terminal.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the given string and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- t48: Probably from NT29 -> ... since I remember NT29 -> NT59 NT15, and looking at the RHS, NT59 -> ... and NT15 -> ... but wait, in the given string, t48 is a terminal.

NT0 -> 't93', which is a terminal. But then NT58 -> 't52' or another production? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking more carefully, the terminal tokens are:\nt48 is produced by NT59 via NT59 -> NT0 NT58, but NT0 is 't93' and NT58 is 't52', which is another rule, NT58 -> 't52'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each terminal in the string and see if it's a terminal or derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to work backward. For each token in the string, I need to find if it's a terminal or comes from a non-terminal. Let's process each token one by one.\n\nThe string is: t48, t2, t2, t71, t80, t11, t15, t13, t2, t2, t2, t87, t20, t51, t50, t2, t15, t60, t63.\n\nSo, let's map each token to their possible source in the grammar.\n\nStarting with t48: Looking in the grammar for any production where a non-terminal generates 't48'. Let me go through the rules. I see:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and NT0 is 't93' (terminal). Wait, no, that's a production of NT39 -> NT34 NT34, but no, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me look through all the rules again. \n\nLooking for any production that has 't48' as a terminal:\n\nLooking at the rules, some have terminals on the RHS:\n\n- NT57 -> NT68 NT2 --> terminals are 't68' and 't2'? No, wait, NT68 is 't50' and 't24', right? No, wait, let's re-examine the rules given.\n\nWait, the provided rules include:\n\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT26 -> 't13'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\nWait, no, hold on.

No, but I recall another rule where a non-terminal resolves to a terminal. So, NT29 is on the LHS of some production, but looking through the RHS, I don't see NT29 on the RHS of any production. However, another rule is NT29 -> t48? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules again:\n\nI see that:\n\n- NT29 -> NT15 NT21\n\nSo that's two non-terminals. Similarly, other rules might result in terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal. For example, NT52 -> 't63' is a production. Similarly, NT24 -> 't24' is a production. So, each non-terminal might at some point resolve to a terminal.\n\nBut in this string, there are multiple 't's, so I need to find a path from S through the grammar to each token.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could have been generated.\n\nLet me think of the string as a sequence of terminals, which must be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. However, to have a string of length 18, the derivation would involve a parse tree with a certain structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for context-free grammars in CNF to determine membership. However, since I'm doing this manually, maybe it's more efficient to see if the string can be split into a sequence that follows the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t48, t2, t2, t71, t80, t11, t15, t13, t2, t2, t2, t87, t20, t51, t50, t2, t15, t60, t63.\n\nThat's 18 tokens. Let's see if I can group them in a way that each group corresponds to a production rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the string as a sequence of operations that can be built up from the grammar. Let's consider the starting symbol S and see how it can derive some of these tokens.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT29 NT21"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what Chomsky normal form (CNF) is. CNF requires every production rule to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol can produce a terminal directly.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems that all the non-terminals on the left-hand side (LHS) produce exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) except for some which produce a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, each production either combines two non-terminals or ends with a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would involve breaking down each non-terminal into their RHS symbols step by step until only terminals remain. The key here is to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: t48, t2, t2, t56, t2, t2, t2, t93, t15, t11, t15, t30, t93, t49, t35, t2, t15, t48, t63.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every production step should eliminate one non-terminal, replacing it with two non-terminals, until the entire string is made up of terminals. Alternatively, terminals can be produced directly.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a parse tree, ensuring that every split (non-terminal) produces two subtrees, and at the leaves, we get the terminals. So, let's try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nI think a useful method is to simulate the parser using the grammar, perhaps using the CYK algorithm or a top-down approach. Let's attempt a top-down parsing starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has 19 tokens. Starting with the start symbol S, which can produce NT29 NT21. So, the first two symbols should be the result of NT29 and NT21. Let's see what each of these produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 can produce t48 directly (from the rule NT29 -> t48). So the first symbol t48 is matched. Then, the next symbol should be the result of NT21. Let's check NT21's productions. The rules for NT21 are: NT21 -> NT28 NT21 and NT21 -> t97.\n\nWait, that can't be. If NT21 can produce itself and another non-terminal, then it might have a recursive structure. But in our string, the next symbol after t48 is t2. Hmm, that might not match. Let me check.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write out the production rules correctly. From the grammar, for NT21, the rules are:\n\nNT21 -> NT28 NT21\nNT21 -> t97\n\nWait, that seems like it's a possibility. So, NT21 can produce t97 directly or produce NT28 and NT21. If it's the latter, it would have to split into NT28 NT21, each of which might require further expansion.\n\nBut in our string, after t48 (produced by NT29), the next symbol is t2. So we need to see if the next part of the string can be produced by NT21, which is the second symbol after S. But in this case, the second symbol is t2, not t97. That might be a problem, unless there's another way to get t2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the productions. Let me double-check the grammar. Hmm, I see:\n\nLooking back, I see S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the production S is split into NT29 and NT21, each of which needs to produce the corresponding symbols.\n\nIn our string, the first symbol is t48, which matches NT29 -> t48. So the first part is done. Now, the next symbol is t2, which should come from NT21. Let's check the rules for NT21:\n\nNT21 has two rules: NT21 -> NT28 NT21 and NT21 -> t97.\n\nWait, so if NT21 is to produce t2, is there a production that does that? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT21 producing t2.

Wait, I'm mixing up the non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, most non-terminals produce terminals or other non-terminals. For example, NT10 -> NT5 NT19, but that's two non-terminals, so that's a production that doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nLooking for direct terminal productions, I see:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal's productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t70 t47 (Wait, no, NT1 \u2192 ... Let me scan through all the rules for non-terminals that produce a single 't' followed by a digit.\n\nLooking through all rules, I spot:\n\nNT25 production? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\nS: NT29 NT21\n\nNT26: NT24 NT72, NT24 NT38, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe a better approach is to see which terminals appear where and check if the grammar can generate this string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t48, which matches NT29's production. That's good. Then the second token is t2, which is produced by NT21. But looking at NT21's productions, I don't see any where it produces t2. The productions are either NT28 NT21 or t97. So for NT21, if it produces t2, that would require a production rule that's not listed.\n\nWait, does that mean NT21 can't produce t2? Because in the given rules, NT21 can't produce t2. So that would mean the string can't be generated, since after S, we have t48 and t2, but NT21 can't produce t2.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I misread the productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through each production rule:\n\nI see NT65 -> t56\n\nNT12 is not present, so maybe NT65 can produce t56 directly. Wait, but that's for NT65, not NT21. So I think my initial assumption is correct: NT21 can only produce t97 directly, or recursively use NT28. Since t2 isn't an option, the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking about how the parser works. Let me try to see if there's a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is using a different arrangement. Let's try to break it down symbol by symbol.\n\n1. Start with S: NT29 NT21\n\nSo the first two symbols must be t48 (from NT29) and something that produces t2. But NT21 can't produce t2 directly. So that's a problem.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to analyze, especially with the help of parsers like CYK. \n\nFirst, I consider what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means. CNF requires that all production rules be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit this structure since all productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNext, I look at the start symbol S. It starts as S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the entire string should be generated by expanding S until all symbols are terminals, and the sequence matches the given string.\n\nI start by breaking down each non-terminal step by step. I'll make a table to keep track of possible expansions and see if the terminals in the string correspond correctly.\n\nLooking at the first part, the string starts with t48, t11, t15, t11, t15. Let's see which non-terminals expand to these. \n\nt48 is a terminal and appears in NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, among others. Wait, but in the provided rules, t48 is actually produced by NT24 where NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, and looking further, t48 is also produced by NT59 \u2192 NT48 't48'? Wait, I might be confusing because some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, the right-hand side of NT58 is 't52' or 't28'? Wait, let me check. Wait, the grammar has NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28 and some terminals. Wait, no: looking back, NT58's productions include NT58 \u2192 NT37 NT72 and NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nWait, but the terminals listed are 't48', 't11', 't15', etc. So perhaps the non-terminals expand into these terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a CYK-style parsing method. The CYK algorithm parses strings in O(n^3) time, but maybe I can do it manually for this string.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens, so the length is 20. Let's see the structure.\n\nCYK algorithm steps:\n1. Initialize a table where each cell (i, j) represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring from i to j.\n2. The size of the table will be 20 columns and 20 rows (since the string length is 20). But since the string is long, maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for any possible derivations. Let's attempt to track the expansion steps.\n\nThe string is: t48 t11 t15 t11 t15 t24 t35 t2 t11 t15 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t33 t48 t97\n\nLet me write down each token and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFirst token: t48.

Wait, the provided rules have:\n\nLooking through all the rules, do any non-terminals directly produce t48? Or do they produce t48 through a chain?\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT48 't48'??? Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the rules provided, for example, NT59 has two productions:\nNT59 \u2192 NT10 NT58\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nWait, that doesn't seem to produce t48. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking for 't48' anywhere as a production.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT24 -> NT10 NT57\nWait, in the rules, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57. NT10 is NT10 -> NT5 NT19, and NT57 \u2192 NT28 NT24.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each production and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note that all non-terminals are either part of the productions leading to terminals or other non-terminals. So, the idea is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of non terminals that expand to this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of steps.\n\nLet me try to map the string's non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t48. Maybe t48 comes from NT24.\n\nLooking at the NT24 rules: NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57.\n\nWait, so if NT24 can expand into t48, but looking at the rules for NT24, I don't see any direct production for t48. NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57. So it's a non-terminal, not a terminal. So perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, let's check NT24's rule again. According to the provided grammar, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, but looking for NT24 leading to a terminal, perhaps through other steps.\n\nHmm, maybe t48 is generated by NT65, which has a rule NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72. And looking through NT37 and NT72, do they produce any terminals?\n\nWait, looking for NT37 and NT72 as terminals. NT37 has a production NT37 \u2192 't2'. Yes! NT37 \u2192 't2' is a terminal. Similarly, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nWait, so let's see NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72. NT37 is 't2', and NT72 is NT65 NT37. Hmm, this seems recursive.\n\nWait, perhaps if I follow that, NT65 can produce 't2' and then continue recursing, but that would generate multiple 't2's. But in the string, there's a t2 at position 8: t2 in the string is token 8.\n\nWait, let's think about the string structure.\n\nThe string is: t48, t11, t15, t11, t15, t24, t35, t2, t11, t15, t93, t63, t2, t56, t2, t2, t93, t33, t48, t97.\n\nLooking at token 7: t2. That's a small token that might be from NT37's production.\n\nWait, let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe first token is t48. Looking at the start rule S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S is split into NT29 and NT21. So for the string to start with t48, perhaps one of these non-terminals produces t48 and the next part produces t11 t15 t11 t15, etc.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nLooking at node S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the entire string must be the result of NT29 expanding and NT21 expanding.\n\nSo, first, let's see what NT29 can produce.\n\nLooking for the production of NT29.\n\nFrom the provided rules: NT29 \u2192 NT48 't48'. Wait, no. Wait, I'm looking for the productions of NT29.\n\nWait, the given rules do not list a production for NT29 beyond NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT29. No, wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, is there a production for NT29?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n...\nWait, I don't see a direct production for NT29 except for NT29 \u2192 NT47 NT29. So NT29 can produce NT47 NT29. Wait, but I'm looking for the terminal 't48'.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the entire string can be checked for all the terminals and see if they match any expansion rules.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation increases the string length by one.\n\nAlternatively, think about the possible terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so each production is binary (A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a). In CNF, any string in the language can be derived by expanding each symbol into two steps until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

Or is it that one of its productions is to 't18' and another to 't72'? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar shows for NT20: NT20 -> NT2 NT55 and NT20 -> NT72 \u2192 which are non-terminals, so NT20 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. But in the 'terminals' section, there's an entry for NT20, but looking:\n\nIn the grammar, for NT20, I see NT20 -> NT2 NT55 and NT20 is not in the terminals.

Because if that's the case, then NT24 is a terminal since it directly becomes 't24'. Similarly, NT5 -> 't93' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, some NTx are terminals if their production is a terminal. But in my initial analysis, I thought that any NTx with a production RHS that includes a 't' is terminal. However, in the grammar, I see that some NTx may have productions that are combinations, like NT26 -> NT24 NT2: that is, non-terminals. But also, I see NT24 -> 't24'\u2014so NT24 is a terminal because it produces a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, so in the grammar, an NTx becomes a terminal only if it's explicitly defined to produce a literal.

{"custom_id":"request-339","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. It looks like the grammar is a set of productions, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and expanding into other non-terminals or terminals on the right. The symbol 'S' is the start symbol because it's the only non-terminal with no left side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t97 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t23 t16 t2 t93 t33 t60 t97`.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the string, it's a sequence of terms starting with 't's and numbers. Some of them are two digits, like 't97', 't48', etc. Others are single digits like 't2' and 't20'. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21: So, S expands into two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21.\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n- NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- And so on.\n\nBut wait, hold on. There are multiple NT symbols with similar numbers, like NT2, NT4, NT6, etc. I think these are different non-terminals. For example, NT2 is different from NT21, right? Because their expansion rules are different.\n\nThe string in question has various terminal symbols: t48, t2, t56, t97, etc. Each seems to correspond to a specific non-terminal that eventually expands into that terminal.\n\nSo, my approach should be to parse the string by trying to find possible derivations from the grammar, starting from S and breaking down the string into its components.\n\nLet's outline the possible steps:\n\n1. Split the string into tokens. Each token is either 't' followed by a number or a single 't' as a terminal. But in the string given, all are like 't48', 't2', etc. Wait, the string seems to be already tokenized as individual terms. So each element like 't48', 't2', etc., is a separate token.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the grammar uses NT symbols, which are non-terminals that can expand into these terminal strings.\n\n2. The string is: [t48, t2, t56, t2, t2, t93, t97, t2, t2, t56, t2, t2, t2, t15, t23, t16, t2, t93, t33, t60, t97]\n\nSo, that's 20 tokens in total.\n\n3. To generate the string, the derivation should result in this sequence of terminals. So, we can try to build a parse tree starting from S, expanding it step by step to see if the string matches.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the start is S => NT29 NT21.\n\nThen, each of these NT29 and NT21 must expand into sequences that, when combined, form the string.\n\nNow, looking at NT29:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nAnd NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nAnd NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but here it's NT0. So, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which then NT5 \u2192 NT93, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of possible sequences.\n\nEach NT symbol must eventually derive into a terminal string. So, each NT in the grammar must have a production that leads to terminals, sometimes through multiple steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the NT symbols directly produce terminals, like NT59 \u2192 't93', NT15 \u2192 't50', etc. Others, like NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which then produce terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the best way is to see if each token in the string can be derived from some NT symbol, and that the entire sequence can be formed by expanding the grammar correctly.\n\nLet's consider each token in the string and see if they can be derived from any NT symbol present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t48: I need to find an NT that can produce 't48'. In the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nWait, and NT0 is a non-terminal, but let's check if any NT symbol produces 't48'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5 NT60' (Wait, looking at the grammar, there are multiple NT terminals, but let me list all NT productions that result in single terminals:\n\nNT59 \u2192 't0' ? No, looking, each rule is written as two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit complex. Let's try to find all NT symbols that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58: both non-terminals, so not terminal.\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT19: non-terminals.\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58: non-terminals.\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52: non-terminals.\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34: non-terminals.\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55: non-terminals.\n- NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19: non-terminals.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60: non-terminals.\n- NT97: wait, do any NT symbols produce 't97'? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT68 NT2: non-terminals.\n\nWait, does any NT directly produce a terminal? Looking through all rules, I think most are two non-terminals except a few that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let's go through each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21: both non-terminals.\n2. NT47 \u2192 NT51 NT36: non-terminals.\n3. NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72: non-terminals.\n4. NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55: non-terminals.\n5. NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37: non-terminals.\n6. NT65 \u2192 NT15 NT65: non-terminals.\n7. NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59: non-terminals.\n8. NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38: non-terminals.\n9. NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34: non-terminals.\n10. NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55: non-terminals.\n11. NT60 \u2192 NT49: Oh, wait, I didn't notice this. NT60 \u2192 't49'. Wait, does a NT symbol produce 't49'? Or is it a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at rule 11: NT60 \u2192 't49'. That's a terminal, so NT60 is a non-terminal that directly produces 't49'.\n\nSimilarly, looking through other rules:\n\nNT41 \u2192 't16'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nLooking at NT60 \u2192 't49' (rule 11)\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36 (rule 17), not a terminal.\n\nNT19 \u2192 't15' (rule 19)\n\nWait, no, rule 19 is NT19 \u2192 't15'. So NT19 produces 't15'.\n\nSimilarly, let's list all NT symbols and their productions:\n\nNT59: produces NT0 and NT58 (rule 2: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58)\n\nWait, but many are non-terminals. So, let's see:\n\nEach NT in the string must be part of a derivation that ultimately leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\n1. t48: I need to find an NT that can produce t48. Wait, in the grammar, is there any NT that directly expands to t48? Let me check rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I need to see if any NT directly expands to t48.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I only see NT60 \u2192 't49' (rule1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

All the productions are in the form A \u2192 BC, which is a requirement for CNF. Each non-terminal (like S, NT29, etc.) expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Terminals are things like 't48', 't30', and so on, which represent specific symbols that don't expand further.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the production rule S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so S will expand into two non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-359","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t15 t11 t49 t11 t33 t60 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t48 t97`, and I need to check if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CNF grammar has each production rule as A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can have an empty string. The given grammar is in CNF, so each production doesn't have more than two symbols on the right-hand side. That helps because I can think in terms of derivation steps where each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until we reach the terminals, which will be the letters in the string.\n\nThe main idea is to parse the string from the bottom up, trying to find a way to split the string into a sequence of productions that can generate it. This is similar to how a pushdown automaton works, processing the string by breaking it into parts that fit the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list out the productions first to get a clear picture:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n- NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37\n- NT65 \u2192 NT15 NT65\n- NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n- NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n- NT15 \u2192 NT71 NT68\n- NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41\n- NT65 \u2192 NT50 NT46\n- NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n- NT57 \u2192 NT68 NT2\n- NT39 \u2192 NT46 NT62\n- NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47\n- NT70 \u2192 NT51 NT36\n- NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34\n- NT1 \u2192 NT21 NT24\n- NT62 \u2192 NT1 NT24\n- NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- NT59 \u2192 NT1 NT13\n- NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n- NT1 \u2192 NT20 NT60\n- NT65 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n- NT71 \u2192 NT10 NT65\n- NT52 \u2192 't97'\n- NT13 \u2192 't50'\n- NT37 \u2192 't2'\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT51 \u2192 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't80'\n- NT60 \u2192 't49'\n- NT41 \u2192 't16'\n- NT26 \u2192 't13'\n- NT65 \u2192 't56'\n- NT5 \u2192 't93'\n- NT34 \u2192 't48'\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT50 \u2192 't71'\n- NT52 \u2192 't63'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' (Wait, but this might be a conflicting production since there's another NT24)\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT20 \u2192 't72'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't91'\n- NT47 \u2192 't51'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT71 \u2192 't90'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't30'\n- NT33 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't11'\n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals like NT24 have multiple productions, some of which produce terminals. However, in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except for the terminals. So, in the case of S \u2192 NT29 NT21, both are non-terminals. Let me cross-check each production to ensure they are in CNF. Since all productions have two non-terminals, except those explicitly ending with a terminal, which are like NT34 \u2192 't48' or NT52 \u2192 't97', these are acceptable as they are only a single non-terminal on the RHS, which can represent a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, every production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except for one rule which can produce a single terminal. So, looking back, the given productions have varying RHSs. For example, NT24 \u2192 't91' is a single terminal, but also NT24 has other productions where it's the left-hand side producing two non-terminals. That's possible because in the problem statement, it's a context-free grammar, not necessarily strictly in CNF as sometimes defined, where all productions must have exactly two, one being a non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the problem states the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, the productions listed should have each either two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking again: NT24 \u2192 't91' is a terminal, but other productions of NT24 like NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57 are two non-terminals. That seems okay because a single rule can be either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, given that, I can build a parse tree.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t15 t11 t49 t11 t33 t60 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t48 t97`. That's a list of tokens, all terminals.\n\nMy approach is to split the string into a sequence of productions that can generate it. Since the grammar is a context-free CNF, I can model this as a series of splits, ensuring that every time a non-terminal is replaced, it's split into two parts, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite complex with multiple non-terminals, perhaps I can use the recursive approach or the CYK algorithm for parsing. However, doing this by hand for a long string can be error-prone, so maybe I can look for patterns or key terminals that might help me trace back the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since I might be able to infer how certain terminals are generated, maybe I can work backwards by looking at the terminals and seeing which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet me look for the rightmost or any terminals that have only one production rule.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t48 appears twice, t11 appears multiple times, t15 appears several times. For instance, t24 is in the string too, but maybe it's generated by NT24. Wait, looking at the productions, NT24 can produce 't91', but also has other productions which may split into other non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt48, t11, t15, t87, t20, t51, t50, t2, t71? Wait:\n\nWait, the string is: t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t15 t11 t49 t11 t33 t60 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t48 t97\n\nSo:\n\n1. t48\n\n2. t11\n\n3. t15\n\n4. t87\n\n5. t20\n\n6. t51\n\n7. t50\n\n8. t2\n\n9. t11\n\n10. t15\n\n11. t11\n\n12. t49\n\n13. t11\n\n14. t33\n\n15"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-358","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is already in CNF, which means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. That should make things a bit simpler because I can use the simple bottom-up parsing method or track derivations.\n\nThe string given is: t48 t2 t71 t93 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t60 t63.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. To do this, I should probably try to break down the string into parts that match the non-terminals. Since the string is in the form of tokens separated by spaces, I'll list them out as individual tokens to see which parts correspond to which rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. Let's see some examples:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT47 -> 't47' (Wait, no, looking back, I see NT47 -> NT59 NT51, and NT59 -> NT0 NT58, etc.)\n  \nWait, I need to look up each NT's production rules carefully.\n\nWait, let me write down the terminals:\n\nThe string has the following terminal tokens: t48, t2, t71, t93, t49, t11, t15, etc.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's see which NTs produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can note down which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT41 -> t16\n- NT26 -> t13\n- NT55 -> t10\n- NT29 -> t48\n- NT37 -> t2\n- NT58 -> t20\n- NT20 -> 't18' (Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, NT20 -> NT2 NT55. Wait, but in the terminal part, I have NT20 sometimes being used, does it eventually produce t20? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at NT20: NT20 -> NT2 NT55.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 -> NT10 NT34.\n\nAnd looking at NT10: NT10 -> NT5 NT19.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the string can be split into segments that correspond to NT rules.\n\nLet me start by looking for the longest possible segments that match NT productions. Starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t48. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces t48.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT29 -> t48. Also, NT24 (I think) has a rule that produces t24, but in our case, the first token is t48, so it's probably NT29 or another NT that produces t48.\n\nIn the grammar, NT29 is a terminal, or does it have a production? Looking back, yes, in the grammar, NT29 -> t48. So the first token is t48, which is the result of NT29. So that's a direct match.\n\nSo the first part is S -> NT29 NT21. Wait, no, the start symbol S has a production S -> NT29 NT21. But in the string, the first token is t48, which comes from NT29. So after that, we would need to have NT21 producing t2 t71... Let me check.\n\nWait, the string is: t48 t2 t71 t93 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t60 t63.\n\nSo after the first token t48, the next token is t2. So perhaps the NT21 from the grammar would produce t2, but looking at NT21's production, I see NT21 -> NT2NT55. But wait, NT25 \u2192 NT24 NT28, or something else?\n\nWait, let's check NT21: looking through the grammar rules, I see NT21 is not listed. Wait, in the provided grammar, there are rules for NT21. Let me look:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I spot NT21 -> NT2 NT55.\n\nSo NT21 is a non-terminal that goes to NT2 NT55.\n\nNT2 is another non-terminal.

The start symbol is S, which expands to NT29 NT21. Then, each of these NTs can expand into pairs of other NTs or terminal symbols like 't...' or numbers. Some NTs have multiple production rules, so each can be expanded in different ways.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a series of 't's and numbers, which seem to be terminals in the grammar. The non-terminals (NTs) are combinations like NT29, NT21, etc., and some have further expansions, eventually leading to terminal symbols.\n\nI'll start by splitting the string into tokens separated by spaces to make it easier to parse:\n['t48', 't11', 't33', 't93', 't63', 't2', 't71', 't56', 't2', 't11', 't15', 't91', 't35', 't2', 't49', 't11', 't33', 't2', 't2', 't93', 't15', 't48', 't63']\n\nNow, I'll try to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar. Starting from S, it expands to NT29 NT21. So, the string must be a concatenation of expansions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLet me first process NT29. Looking at the grammar, NT29 can expand in a few ways. One of them is NT47 NT59. Alternatively, from the provided rules, NT29 can also expand into NT13 NT62, but wait, looking back, I don't see a rule for NT29 in the initial provided, but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in the given grammar, NT29 appears in the rule for NT24: NT24->NT29 NT34, so not directly, but maybe indirectly. Alternatively, perhaps I need to check all possible expansions.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the NTs in the grammar are defined as follows:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\nNT59 -> NT13 NT41\nNT59 -> NT24 NT62\nNT29 -> NT13 NT62\nWait, but in the initial problem, the grammar includes several rules. I think I need to list all the rules to track how each NT can expand.\n\nBut given the length, I'll focus on the string and see how each 't' or number can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that some tokens repeat, like 't48', 't11', 't33', etc. Let's see if these can correspond to non-terminals that eventually resolve to these tokens.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string into pairs or possible expansions. Since S starts with NT29 NT21, the string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't48'. Let's see if NT29 can expand to 't48' directly. Looking at the grammar rules, I need to check if any rule for NT29 directly leads to a terminal. Scanning through the rules, I don't see a rule for NT29 that directly expands to a single terminal. However, perhaps through a series of steps.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some NTs expand into other NTs, and we have to apply these recursively until we reach terminals.\n\nFor example, NT29 can expand into NT13 NT62 (from NT24->NT29 NT34, but perhaps that's not directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some rules. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided, for NT59, one of the rules is NT59->NT13 NT41. Then, for NT13, the rule is NT13->'t50', which is a terminal. So NT59 can derive 't50' NT41.\n\nWait, but I'm dealing with NT29, which in the rules can be in NT24->NT29 NT34, so NT29->NT24 NT34. Then NT24 can expand to other NTs. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree from bottom up or top down.\n\nLet's try to see the possible expansion steps.\n\nThe string starts with 't48 t11 t33 t93 t63 t2 t71 t56 t2 t11 t15 t91 t35 t2 t49 t11 t33 t2 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63'\n\nSince the start symbol S is NT29 NT21, the string should be equal to the concatenation of the expansions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo, the string can be split into NT29's expansion and NT21's expansion. Let's look at the string and see if it's possible to partition it such that the first part ends with NT21's expansion and the second part with NT29's.\n\nLooking at the first tokens, 't48' could come from NT29 (if NT29 can derive 't48', even after several steps). But checking the rules, I don't see NT29 directly expanding to 't48', but maybe via a chain of expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look for the rules that produce 't48' as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT59 -> NT10 NT26, then NT10-> 't5' NT59 or NT26-> 't13'. Wait, but in the given rules, there's NT26->'t13' when NT26 expands as NT26->'t13'.\n\nLooking further, in the rules, NT26 is present in:\n\nNT26-> NT24 NT38\nNT38-> NT58 NT34\nNT34-> NT64 NT55\nNT64-> NT59 NT37\nNT59-> ... as above.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it clearly. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the 't48' token. The rules that reach 't48' seem to be in NT24: NT24->'t29' NT34, but wait, looking down, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT33->'t23' NT34\n- NT29->'t48' NT47\n- NT58->'t20' NT28\nWait, wait: let me check the rules again:\n\nIn the provided rules, some have terminal symbols as their expansion. For example:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\nNT59 -> NT13 NT41\nNT59 -> NT24 NT62\nNT29 -> NT13 NT62\nWait, maybe I'm not seeing the exact rules correctly. The user provided a long list, so perhaps I can process each token to see which NTs could produce it.\n\nLet me make a list of all the terminal tokens in the string:\n\nt48, t11, t33, t93, t63, t2, t71, t56, t2, t11, t15, t91, t35, t2, t49, t11, t33, t2, t2, t93, t15, t48, t63.\n\nNow, I'll check each token to see which NTs can derive it.\n\nLooking through the given rules for each terminal:\n\n- t48: in NT29's rules, I see NT29 ->... not directly, but from NT29 perhaps via NT24 or other NTs. Looking through the rules, NT59 can have t48 through NT59->NT13 NT41, but wait: NT13 is 't50', so that would produce 't50' followed by NT41. Alternatively, looking for a rule that directly ends with t48.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking for an NT that has a rule that ends with the token. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking for t48:\n\nLooking at each rule's right-hand side ends with a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-377","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way of structuring CFGs where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. That makes parsing easier because each production either directly produces a terminal or replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals.\n\nAlright, the grammar given is a bit lengthy, but let's see if I can understand its structure. First, I'll list out all the non-terminals and terminals. Looking through the grammar, the non-terminals seem to be S, NT29, NT47, up to NT71 and others. The terminals are given as t followed by numbers, like t97, t48, etc.\n\nThe string to check is: `t48 t11 t33 t90 t30 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t30 t56 t2 t11 t33 t48 t97 t91 t50 t2 t33 t60 t97`.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Given the length of the string, it's going to be a long process, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals. This suggests that the final string must have a structure that can be split through these non-terminals, eventually breaking down into terminals. Also, the production rules seem to involve non-terminals combining into other non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals until they hit terminal symbols.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce terminals. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t0 and t58 (from NT59 -> NT0 NT58)\n- NT33 \u2192 t23 (from NT33 -> NT23)\n- NT51 \u2192 t87 (from NT51 -> NT87)\n- NT39 \u2192 t46 (from NT39 -> NT46)\n- NT15 \u2192 ... wait, NT15 has a production NT71 NT68, both non-terminals. So, it doesn't directly produce a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, that complicates things because not all non-terminals directly produce terminals. That means I need to look for a way the entire string can be built by expanding non-terminals step by step, eventually reaching the terminals in the string.\n\nI should probably look for a pathway from S to t48, then t11, etc. Let's consider the string:\n\nt48 t11 t33 t90 t30 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t30 t56 t2 t11 t33 t48 t97 t91 t50 t2 t33 t60 t97.\n\nThat's 22 tokens long. Since S production results in two non-terminals, perhaps the string is built in a way that combines these two, each possibly generating multiple tokens.\n\nLooking at the first token, t48. Let's see where t48 comes from. Checking the terminal productions:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t91 (from NT24 \u2192 t91)\n- NT47 \u2192 t51 (NT47 \u2192 t51)\n- NT1 \u2192 t73 (NT1 \u2192 t73)\n- NT60 \u2192 t49 (Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT5 \u2192 t93, NT34 \u2192 t48 from NT34 \u2192 t48).\nAh, yes, NT34 has t48 as one of its productions: NT34 \u2192 t48 NT55 or other, but wait, in the given grammar, it's either NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 or other rules. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55.\n\nWait, but another rule is NT34 \u2192 NT48 NT55. Wait no, actually looking through the rules, NT34 isn't directly a terminal, but there's NT58 \u2192 t58 and others. Wait, no, here's a better way: some non-terminals have multiple rules, but only NT0, NT5, etc., have rules that directly give terminals. Wait, let me check all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t0, t58\n- NT72 \u2192 t65, t37? No, NT72 has production NT65 NT37, which are non-terminals.\n- NT46 has NT2 NT10 and NT26 NT59, both non-terminals.\n- NT5 has t93\n- NT36 has t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT50 \u2192 t71, t46\n- NT65 \u2192 t56, t72?\nWait, looking at NT65 productions: NT65\u2192 NT37 NT72? Or is there a production that produces a terminal? Looking: NT65 has NT50 NT46, NT37 NT72, etc. None of these have terminals, so NT65 is not a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list the terminal productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t0, t58\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT15 \u2192 t71, t68?\nWait, NT15: looking at the rules, it's NT71 NT68, which are non-terminals. So NT15 doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t0 NT58\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 t37\n- NT46 \u2192 NT2 t10 or NT26 NT59\n- NT65 \u2192 NT37 t72\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\nWait, none of these produce terminals except for the ones where it's directly written as NTx \u2192 a, where a is a terminal token.\n\nWait, wait, looking again:\n\nNT59 has two rules: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nOh, wait, but in the initial list, for NT59, one of the productions is NT59 \u2192 t2 NT58? No, in the given grammar, NT59's productions are:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for NT59: I see NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 and NT59 \u2192 NT33 NT41. So no direct terminal. The only way to get t0 is through NT59 expanding to NT0 and NT58, but NT58 may produce t58. Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me go back to the string.\n\nThe first token is t48. So I need to find which non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nLooking at the rules for t48:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t58 is not t48.\nWait, checking all the rules:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t48 NT55 or NT64 NT55. Wait, looking back at the given rules:\n\nYes, for NT34, there's NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 and NT34 \u2192 NT48 NT55.

The grammar is provided along with the string, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the structure of the grammar to understand how it generates strings. Chomsky Normal Form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar has various productions, all of which are either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t48 t11 t15 t23 t16 t2 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t11 t15 t24 t97 t2 t56 t2 t60 t2 t15 t48 t97`.\n\nLooking at the string, it seems to consist of a series of 't' followed by numbers. I notice that 't97' is a terminal. Let me see which non-terminals in the grammar produce 't97'.

Looking at the grammar, NT34 \u2192 't48', and NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, which is NT52\u2192't97', so that part is okay.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, maybe using a top-down approach with the start symbol S.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm going to try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is `t48 t11 t33 t93 t97 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t11 t33 t60 t97 t91 t50 t2 t15 t48 t63`.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since the terminals are given as letters followed by digits, like t48, I think each rule that ends with a terminal is a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many symbols like NT26, NT47, etc., have production rules that split into other NT symbols or end with a terminal. So the approach is probably to find a way to parse the string top-down using these rules.\n\nI'll start by trying to break down the string into parts and see if I can find the starting symbol S and see how it can produce the string. The string starts with t48 and ends with t63. Let's see which rules produce t48 or t63.\n\nI notice that in the grammar, NT59 is a production that sometimes results in t48, like in NT34 -> NT64 NT55 and NT34 -> t48, etc. Similarly, NT58 can produce t20 or t2, t24, etc.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if there's a leftmost derivation from S. Let's see, the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT21 (from S -> NT29 NT21).\n\nSo the string should start with t48 and maybe end with t63. Wait, the string starts with t48, which could come from NT29 or NT34 or others. Looking back, I see:\n\n- NT29 has a production ending with t48: NT34 -> t48\n- NT26 ends with t13: NT26 -> t13\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me see each non-terminal and what terminals they can produce.\n\nThe grammar has NT symbols that produce terminals in various ways. The string I have is a sequence of terminals like t48, t11, t33, etc.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production that ends with a terminal might correspond to a single token in the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation adds exactly one terminal or splits into two non-terminals. The fact that the string has multiple terminals suggests a way of splitting the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first step in the derivation would be to produce NT29 NT21. The string starts with t48. Now, looking at the NT29 and NT21 symbols:\n\nIs there a way that NT29 can produce t48, or does it produce a non-terminal that can derive t48?\n\nLooking at the NT29 rules:\n\nAh, I see that NT34 has a production ending with t48: NT34 -> t48. So maybe NT29 can produce NT34 and another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking for where NT29 appears as a left-hand side:\n\nI don't see NT29 in the left-hand side of any production except in the start symbol. But let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t64 NT55\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT59 \u2192 t0 NT58\n- NT55 \u2192 t10 NT34\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55 (twice)\n- And so on.\n\nWait, so in the rules, NT34 can be either a concatenation of NT64 and NT55 or a terminal t48. So maybe the way the string is built is by expanding some of these.\n\nBut the string starts with t48, so perhaps the NT29 in S \u2192 NT29 NT21 can produce t48 and something else, but that doesn't make sense because S is producing NT29 NT21, which need to derive into the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire string being a leftmost derivation. Let me try to split the string into chunks that match each step.\n\nBut this might be complicated. Alternatively, since this grammar is in CNF, each step either introduces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal is produced by a rule that leads to that terminal directly or through some splits.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, the set of derivations corresponds to the parse trees with each internal node having exactly two children. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a leaf in the parse tree, and the structure of the parse tree must match the string.\n\nSince the string is a list of terminals, I can try to construct a sequence of non-terminals that, when expanded, will generate this string.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string starts with t48, which must come from NT29 or NT21.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT29. Does NT29 produce any terminal?\n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see NT29 \u2192 a terminal except when combined in a production like NT34 \u2192 t48. Wait, perhaps I need to track how NT29 is produced.\n\nWait, looking for NT29 on the left-hand side, I see that in some rules, like NT39 \u2192 NT26 NT62 or NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, etc. So I don't see any direct terminal production from NT29 except perhaps through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again:\n\nLooking for NT29, I don't see it as a left-hand side except in S and the start. So maybe I'm wrong there. Perhaps the production S \u2192 NT29 NT21 can only produce t48 and t63 when NT29 is used in a certain way.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, I need to see if NT29 can produce a terminal, maybe t48, and NT21 can produce t63, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's see NT21. Looking at the rules, NT21 is in S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and also in NT21 as a left-hand side in other rules, like NT21 \u2192 t18.\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nFor NT21, the left-hand sides I see are in S \u2192 NT21, and in other productions, not many. Looking:\n\nFrom rule NT24 \u2192 t24,\n\nLooking for NT21 as LHS: I see NT21 \u2192 t18. Yes, rule 20: NT21 \u2192 t18.\n\nSo that gives us a way for NT21 to produce t18.\n\nSimilarly, let's check if NT29 can produce t48.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT29, I see that it's not directly a production, because I don't see any rule where LHS is NT29 other than in the start symbol S\u2192NT29 NT21.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So NT29 doesn't have a production to any terminals directly; instead, it must be processed through other rules. So, to produce a terminal t48, NT29 must be derived from other non-terminals that can eventually produce t48.\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT34, we have NT34 \u2192 t48, so if any non-terminal A leads to NT34, then A can produce t48.\n\nLooking back, do any rules produce NT34? Let's see: NT21 is not in a production for NT34. Let me check all the rules to see if any RHS includes NT34.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that:\n\nLooking at:\n\nNT34 is a non-terminal that can be part of other productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT34 \u2192 t48, so any production where a non-terminal leads directly or indirectly to NT34 can produce t48.\n\nLooking for rules where LHS => RHS includes NT34:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal is replaced by something that includes NT34. For example:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT59 NT37\n- NT59 \u2192 t0 NT58\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n\nSo, in that case, if we have some non-terminal that can derive up to NT34, then we can produce a t48.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Maybe I should tackle the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t11 t33 t93 t97 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-412","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the basics. Context-free grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of zero or more non-terminals and terminals. The string we're evaluating is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a string like 't48' or something that seems to represent a non-terminal symbol like 'NTx'.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of production rules. Each line starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT29, etc.), and the RHS is a combination of other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. Some of these productions end up directly producing terminals, like when a non-terminal is rewritten to a single 't' followed by a number. For example, NT68 \u2192 't30', so when we see 't30' in our string, that can come directly from NT68.\n\nOur task is to see if the given string can be derived from the starting symbol S using these production rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t11 t15 t48 t48 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t49 t20 t2 t56 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63 t91 t50 t2 t15 t60 t97`.\n\nLet me list these tokens for clarity:\n\nt48, t11, t15, t48, t48, t56, t2, t23, t16, t2, t49, t20, t2, t56, t2, t11, t15, t48, t63, t91, t50, t2, t15, t60, t97.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a terminal symbol. So, we need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar through some sequence of productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, our string must start with something that can produce NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29: From the grammar, there's a production ND29 \u2192 't48', and also looking at other rules I see that NT29 might be used elsewhere. Wait, actually, looking back, in the provided grammar, NT29's productions are not explicit except that it's part of the S production.\n\nWait, no, looking at the given grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, we need to see what NT29 and NT21 can produce. Let's check the productions for NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT29 appears in the production of NT59: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and perhaps others. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, the NT29 production isn't listed as a terminal. The only terminal involving 't' is when NT is transformed into t followed by a number. Let me check if any NT non-terminals directly produce t48, t11, etc.\n\nLooking for t48: There's an NT47 \u2192 't48'. Also, NT65 \u2192 't56', and NT5 \u2192 't93', etc.\n\nSo, let me create a mapping of the terminals to their non-terminals:\n\n- t48 comes from NT47\n- t11 comes from NT5 (since NT5 \u2192 't93'\u2014wait, no, looking again, wait: NT5's production is NT5 \u2192 't93', no. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\nI see that some NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't93'\n- NT70 \u2192 't51'\n- NT50 \u2192 't71'\n- NT52 \u2192 't63'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT58 \u2192 't20'\n- NT20 \u2192 't18'\n- NT20 \u2192 't72'\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'\n- NT24 \u2192 't91'\n- NT47 \u2192 't51'\n- NT1 \u2192 't73'\n- NT71 \u2192 't90'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15'\n- NT68 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, let me confirm each:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't73'\nNT70 \u2192 't51'\nNT50 \u2192 't71'\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\nNT38 \u2192 't35'\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\nNT20 \u2192 't18' and 't72'\nNT29 \u2192 't48'\nNT24 \u2192 't91' (another production)\nNT47 \u2192 't51'\nNT1 \u2192 't73' (multiple productions)\nNT68 \u2192 't30'\nNT19 \u2192 't15'\n\nSo, for our string, each token must correspond to one of these productions. Let me list the tokens and map them:\n\n1. t48 \u2192 NT29 or NT47 or NT24 (since NT24 has 't24' which is 't24', not 't48').\n\nLooking at the list, only NT29 and NT47 produce 't48' via NT29\u2192 't48' and NT47\u2192 't48'.\n\nThe first token is t48. So, the first part of the string starts with t48, which can be produced by NT29 or NT47.\n\nLooking at the context of the string, since S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the first production for S is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nSo, our string must start with the terminal string derived from the RHS of S's production. The RHS is NT29 followed by NT21. So, the first token must come from NT29, and the second from NT21? Wait, no, because each non-terminal can produce multiple terminals. So S expands to NT29 NT21, which each can produce a string of terminals. The overall string is the concatenation of these two.\n\nSo, for S to generate our string, the entire string must be the concatenation of the production of NT29 and the production of NT21.\n\nTherefore, the first part generated by NT29 must match the beginning of the string, and the second part generated by NT21 must match the remaining portion.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt48 t11 t15 t48 t48 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t49 t20 t2 t56 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63 t91 t50 t2 t15 t60 t97.\n\nSo, the first token is t48. That can come from NT29 or NT47. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: t48 comes from NT29.\n\nThen, NT29 \u2192 't48' (since in the grammar, NT29's production is NT29 \u2192 't48'). Wait, no, looking back at the grammar, do we have NT29 producing 't48'? No, from the list given, it's NT65 \u2192 't56', NT29 isn't listed as producing a terminal. Wait, am I mixing up?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT29's production: There's a line NT29 \u2192 NT48. Hmm, no, wait, wait. No, the only production for NT29 is in the first line: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, NT29 is a non-terminal, and unless there's a production rule for NT29, it's considered a non-terminal that cannot derive further. But wait, no, in the provided grammar, each line is a production for a non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, for example:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nSo, S is defined by NT29 and NT21. So, unless there are any other rules for NT29, it's a non-terminal that can't go further. Wait, no, that's not correct. In Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal must have a production rule where it expands into two non-terminals or a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-438","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, Chomsky Normal Form is a specific way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing easier, maybe even with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just doing this manually, I'll have to figure it out another way.\n\nFirst, let me get a clear understanding of the grammar and the string. The grammar's start symbol is S. From the given productions, I see S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, any string generated by this grammar must start with the combinations of NT29 and NT21. Let me check the string: it starts with t48 t56 t2 ... Hmm, so t48 and t56 are terminals, not non-terminals. So, looking for where t48 and t56 come from.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that some NT symbols produce other NT symbols, and others produce terminal strings. So let's see what t48 and t56 derive from.\n\nt48 is a terminal, and I look through the productions to find which NT symbols produce t48. Scanning through, I find NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT57 is a production, but that's not helpful. Wait, more importantly, some of the NT symbols directly produce t48 and t56.\n\nWait, in the given productions, NT24 \u2192 t24 is a production. So t24 is generated by NT24. Similarly, t56 is generated by NT65 \u2192 t56. So t48 is also a terminal. Checking the productions for t48's NT symbol: looking at the list, NT24 produces t24, but I don't see NT24 producing t48. Wait, no, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the productions again.\n\nWait, the last production is NT24 \u2192 t24. So t24 is generated by NT24. So, no NT produces t48 directly. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t48. Hmm, that's problematic because none of the NT symbols directly produce t48. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the productions, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT20 \u2192 t72\n- NT29 \u2192 t48\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t33\n- etc.\n\nWait, I just noticed that NT29 \u2192 t48 is a production. Yes, so NT29 produces t48. So the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols should come from NT29 and NT21. But the string starts with t48, which is only possible if NT29 \u2192 t48, so the first part is t48, and then comes whatever NT21 produces.\n\nWait, let me see: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. NT29 \u2192 t48, so the first part is t48. Now, the next symbol is t56. So, looking at how NT21 is produced. Let's find what NT21 produces. Scanning through the productions, I don't see NT21 being in any production, unless I missed it. Wait, let me check again:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT21 \u2192 t18, for example, or is that correct? Wait, I can't find NT21 being a terminal. Looking at all the NTs, I don't see NT21. Let's see: The productions list includes NT21 \u2192 't18'? Let me check. Wait, the production list shows:\n\nLooking at the list, some of the productions are:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT13 \u2192 t50\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n- NT34 \u2192 t60\n- NT51 \u2192 t87\n- NT39 \u2192 t80\n- NT60 \u2192 t49\n- NT41 \u2192 t16\n- NT26 \u2192 t13\n- NT65 \u2192 t56\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT0 \u2192 t93\n- NT50 \u2192 t71\n- NT52 \u2192 t63\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18\n- NT20 \u2192 t72\n- NT29 \u2192 t48\n- NT47 \u2192 t51\n- NT1 \u2192 t73\n- NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n- NT68 \u2192 t30\n- NT33 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t11\n- NT36 \u2192 t20\n- NT19 \u2192 t33\n\nWait, no, looking through all these, I don't see NT21 being a terminal. Wait, perhaps NT21 is produced by another NT symbol? Let me look for any production for NT21.\n\nLooking for NT21 in the productions, I only see lines like:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT21\n\nWait, that's important. The production NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT21. So NT47 produces NT1 and NT21. Now, where else is NT47 used? Looking back, I don't see NT47 used elsewhere except this. Wait, in the given string, after t48 comes t56, which is generated by NT65 \u2192 t56. Let's try to build the parse tree.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNT29 \u2192 t48\n\nSo the first part is t48, then we have NT21. Now, what can NT21 produce? Well, from the productions, I don't see any rule where NT21 is on the left side. The rule is NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT21. So that means that to derive NT21, you have to go through NT47. So perhaps NT21 is derived from NT47, like NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT21, and then eventually NT1 and NT21.\n\nWait, but to get NT21, maybe we need to go deeper. Let's try to parse the string.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t48, which comes from NT29. So after that, the next thing is t56, which comes from NT65. So after t48, we have t56. So the production tree would be S \u2192 NT29 NT21, with NT29 producing t48 and NT21 producing... Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t56 t2 t11 t15 t13 t2 t15 t87 t20 t93 t33 t93 t33 t30 t11 t49 t35 t90 t30 t50 t2 t11 t15 t48 t97\n\nSo the first symbol is t48, which comes from NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNow, NT29 \u2192 t48, so we have consumed t48. Next, we need to parse the next part, which is t56, t2, etc. Wait, no, the entire string is one string, so after t48 comes t56. So after t48, we have t56, which is produced by NT65 \u2192 t56.\n\nSo the S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and after NT29, we have NT21. But how does NT21 produce t56? That can't be, because NT21 doesn't directly produce t56. So perhaps NT21 is derived from another NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT21. So to get NT21, we might have to have NT47. So perhaps NT21 is produced via NT47. Let's see, if NT21 is part of NT47's productions, then maybe the next step is to have NT21 derived from NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-439","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t48 t11 t15 t56 t30 t93 t97 t2 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t24 t80 t93 t33 t13 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t33 t48 t63`. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form grammar has productions where each non-terminal (on the left) produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production in the grammar is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals, and C is a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT29 NT21. This means S produces two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. Each of these will probably break down further according to the rules.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, all of which are t followed by numbers. My task is to trace how the string could be derived from the grammar by retracing the top-down process, checking each terminal to see if it can be produced by any non-terminal.\n\nI'll start by splitting the string into individual tokens to make it easier. The string is:\n\nt48 t11 t15 t56 t30 t93 t97 t2 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t24 t80 t93 t33 t13 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t33 t48 t63\n\nSo 26 tokens in total. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. So during derivation, each non-terminal will eventually produce a pair of symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that S starts, the initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT29 will produce the first part of the string, and NT21 will produce the second part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48. So I need to see if t48 can be produced by NT29. Checking the productions for NT29, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT15\n\nSo NT29 can only produce NT59 and NT15. Therefore, t48 must come from either NT59 or NT15.

{"custom_id":"request-451","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem to work through. Let me try to understand what's needed here. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and a string. I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21. So every string generated by the grammar must start with NT29 and end with NT21, I think. Wait, no, in CNF, each rule is a single non-terminal producing two non-terminals. So starting with S, the first step is to produce two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. Each of these can then be expanded further until we get terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t48 t56 t2 etc. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, I assume. The non-terminals are represented by other strings, like NT29, NT21, NT47, etc. So the plan is to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to split the non-terminals into two parts, and some of these non-terminals directly expand to terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the derivation step by step. The string starts with t48, so I need to see which non-terminal produces t48. Looking through the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> NT57 NT10\nWait, no, let me check the NT24 rule: Wait, looking back, the grammar has N Ts with numbers. Let me parse the grammar:\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\n- NT29 -> NT48 t2, maybe? Wait no, in the grammar, each production is followed by ->. Let me see each NT rule:\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT29 -> NT48 t2 (Wait no, let me look carefully. Wait, the user provided the grammar with NT29 -> NT48 t2? Or was it something else. Wait, looking back:\n\nOh, the user's provided grammar has lines like:\n\nNT29 -> NT48 t2 ??? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar provided is as follows:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\n\nNT46 -> NT2 NT10\n\nNT15 -> NT71 NT68\n\nNT59 -> NT33 NT41\n\nNT65 -> NT50 NT46\n\nNT5 -> NT72 NT64\n\nNT57 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT46 NT62\n\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT70 NT47\n\nNT70 -> NT51 NT36\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\n\nNT41 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT33 -> NT29 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT21 NT24\n\nNT62 -> NT1 NT24\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19\n\nNT59 -> NT1 NT13\n\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\n\nNT1 -> NT20 NT60\n\nNT65 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT24 -> NT10 NT57\n\nNT71 -> NT10 NT65\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nWait, hold on. N Ts like NT28 have a production with 't' and numbers, for example, NT28 -> 't37' NT72, perhaps?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me note each NT's production:\n\nLooking through each line, for example:\n\nNT28 -> NT52 NT28? Wait, no, looking at the user's grammar:\n\nWait, no, looking through the entire grammar:\n\nLooking at line:\n\nNT28 -> 't37' NT72.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo? Because in the provided grammar, some non-terminals are written with 't' followed by numbers, which would be terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let's parse each production line:\n\nLine: NT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nSo NT47 is the non-terminal, and it splits into NT59 (A) and NT15 (B). \n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> NT24 NT72, etc.\n\nLooking for any production that ends in a terminal symbol. For example, looking through the rules, some N Ts have t followed by numbers. For example:\n\nIn the provided grammar, the line:\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nSo NT52 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal symbol 't97' and nothing else. Wait, is that correct? Because in CNF, each production must be two non-terminals. So NT52 can't produce a terminal directly. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the productions where there's a 't' followed by a number are actually terminal symbols that are part of the rule? For example, the line:\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nThat would mean NT52 -> t97, but since in CNF each production is two non-terminals, that can't be right. So perhaps the 't' followed by number is part of the rule. Maybe it's a formatting issue. Wait, perhaps the user wrote it with a mix of rules and terminals. Alternatively, perhaps it was intended that those lines where NT is followed by 't' and a number, like NT52 -> 't97', are terminal symbols. Wait, perhaps NT52 can produce a terminal symbol 't97' and nothing else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some productions have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, so the production is split into two parts. For example, NT52 -> 't97', which would mean it consumes 't97' as a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So a production where a non-terminal produces a single terminal is not allowed in CNF. Unless the grammar was modified, perhaps in this case, perhaps the 't's are actually part of the rules or perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps NT52 can produce 't97' and perhaps another non-terminal, but looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT52: NT52 -> 't97'\n\nWait, so NT52 produces 't97' and nothing else? That's three characters if we consider 't97' as a token, but perhaps it's actually the last two symbols as a single terminal? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't' is not a part of the terminal symbols but just a prefix, making the actual terminal symbol 't' followed by the number. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a list of production rules, where some rules have single terminal symbols, which would violate CNF. That's strange because CNF requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe all the lines that have a 't' and then a number after the non-terminal are the actual terminal symbols. For example, in the line: NT52 -> 't97', the non-terminal NT52 is followed by 't97', which is a terminal. So that would be NT52 -> t97, not a two-symbol production, which is against CNF. Therefore, this might not be a correct CNF grammar. Hmm, but the user says it's in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps the 't's are actually part of the non-terminals as symbols. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't' is part of the non-terminal's abbreviation, like NT52 is 't52', but that doesn't make sense because NT stands for non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. The given string includes t48, t56, t2, t93, etc. So the grammar must somehow derive this string by expanding NT start.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string must begin with NT29 and end with NT21. Let's see if that's the case in the string.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which suggests NT29 produces t48, but as we saw, NT29"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-454","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to decide whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t48 t93 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t15 t56 t30 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t33 t93 t33 t60 t63 t24 t50 t2 t11 t33 t60 t97`. \n\nFirst, I should remind myself what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. CNF is a set of production rules where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. Importantly, there are no epsilon productions, but in this case, every production seems to have at least one non-terminal on the RHS, except for the terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, CNF allows for the RHS to have two symbols, which can be both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but each production must have exactly two symbols. So looking at the grammar, every production here, like S -> NT29 NT21, has two non-terminals. So this grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar. The strategy I usually use for such problems is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each node is a production rule, and each leaf is a terminal symbol. \n\nBut the string here contains a lot of terminals like t48, t93, etc. So I need to figure out how these terminals correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are all the NT... followed by numbers. For example, NT0, NT1, NT2, etc. Each of these non-terminals on the RHS of a production can be expanded into either another non-terminal or a terminal. However, in this grammar, do any of the non-terminals directly correspond to a terminal? \n\nLooking more closely, I notice that some of the productions produce a terminal. For example, NT52 -> 't97' and others like NT13 -> 't50'. So, the non-terminals can be expanded into terminals. Therefore, the grammar is actually a context-free grammar that can produce strings with these terminal symbols.\n\nSo, to determine if the string is generated, I need to see if it can be broken down into a series of productions starting from S and expanding until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in the given string.\n\nGiven the size of the string, it's going to be a bit tedious, but perhaps I can spot some patterns or look for any terminals that are generated by specific non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to simulate the top-down parsing. In a top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S, I'll try to apply production rules that produce the beginning of the string. Each time, I break down the non-terminals into the appropriate terms, checking step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to try to match the string against the grammar using memoization or recursive descent parsing. But since the string is given, maybe it's manageable to see if the terminals can be matched via the given productions.\n\nLet me look at the string:\n\n`t48 t93 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t15 t56 t30 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t33 t93 t33 t60 t63 t24 t50 t2 t11 t33 t60 t97`.\n\nLet me note the order:\n\n1. t48\n2. t93\n3. t15\n4. t93\n5. t20\n6. t2\n7. t93\n8. t15\n9. t56\n10. t30\n11. t56\n12. t2\n13. t23\n14. t16\n15. t2\n16. t33\n17. t93\n18. t33\n19. t60\n20. t63\n21. t24\n22. t50\n23. t2\n24. t11\n25. t33\n26. t60\n27. t97\n\nNow, I need to see if this sequence can result from applying the productions.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS can expand to NT29 NT21. So, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT29 and NT21. Wait, actually, since each production's RHS is two symbols, S produces two things. So, in the parse tree, the root is S, and each child is a non-terminal, which then expands into the string.\n\nWait, actually, in a derivation, S produces NT29 and NT21. So, in the string, after S, the next part is two symbols: one from NT29 and one from NT21. Alternatively, perhaps it's the first symbol from NT29 and the second from NT21. So, looking at the string, the first two symbols after the initial S are t48 and t93. Let's check:\n\nNT29 -> options:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT29 has several productions. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> NT27 NT57, NT0 NT58, NT33 NT41, NT47 NT51, etc. Wait, in the provided grammar, I need to check all rules where NT29 is on the LHS.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nI see at the end:\n\nNT29 -> NT51 NT27.\n\nNo, looking more carefully. Wait, let me list out all NT29 productions:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through each line, I only see NT29 -> NT51 NT27. So, that's one production. Let me verify:\n\nLooking back through the provided grammar:\n\nYes, here it is:\n\nNT29 -> NT51 NT27\n\nSo, NT29 -> NT51 NT27.\n\nWait, so from NT29, we get NT51 and NT27. Then, each of those can expand further.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the given grammar, NT29's production is NT51 NT27. So, after S, which is NT29 and NT21, we get:\n\nFirst symbol comes from NT29's expansion, which is NT51 and NT27, so the first symbol is either from NT51 or NT27? Or do we get two symbols?\n\nWait no, each non-terminal expands into two symbols. So, for example, S -> NT29 NT21 means that NT29 is replaced by its RHS, and NT21 is replaced by its RHS. So, the first part of the expansion is NT29's replacement, then NT21's replacement.\n\nSo, for S, the first symbol in the string comes from the first non-terminal in S's expansion, which is NT29, and the second symbol comes from the second non-terminal in S's expansion, which is NT21.\n\nWait, that can't be, because in S -> NT29 NT21, the entire production is two non-terminals. So, in the parse tree, each node's children are the two symbols, but when you have NT29, it itself can produce two symbols, and similarly for NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see what each non-terminal expands into.\n\nAnother approach is to see which NT rules can produce the terminals observed in the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first symbol is t48. So, that must come from some NT production that includes t48 as one of its possible symbols.\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice some NTs produce t48. For example, looking at the provided grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> 't24' \n- NT34 -> 't60' (and others)\nWait, looking more carefully at the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I notice several where the RHS includes a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT24 -> NT38 NT72: No terminal.\nWait, no. Wait, in the user's grammar, several rules end with a terminal.

So, the first part is NT29, which produces t48, and the second part is NT21, which is NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Wait, no, let's check NT21's productions: Looking back at the productions, I see NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So NT21 can't directly produce a terminal; it splits into two non-terminals. So the first step would be S \u2192 t48 (from NT29) and NT21. Then, NT21 needs to be expanded. So the string starts with t48, then we have to see how NT21 is expanded.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t48, then t71, which suggests that after S, which is NT29 NT21, we have NT29 producing t48 and NT21 producing... something, but the next symbol is t71. Hmm, that's confusing because NT21's expansion might produce more non-terminals. So maybe I need to see if the next expansion leads to t71.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, building the string by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21. NT29 is t48. NT21 can be expanded into NT55 NT52. So now the current string so far is t48 NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT55 and NT52.\n\nLooking at NT55's production: NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes it a bit easier to handle because each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have just one. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S produces NT29 and NT21. So, any derivation starting with S must have two parts: one derived from NT29 and another from NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48, t93, etc. I need to see how these tokens could be generated from the grammar.\n\nI notice that several production rules lead to terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT2 -> t5 and NT24 -> t24. These are the leaf nodes of the grammar. \n\nLet me list out all the non-terminal symbols and their production rules for clarity.\n\nNon-terminals:\nS, NT29, NT47, NT26, NT20, NT64, NT65, NT46, NT26 (again), NT38, NT34, NT2, NT59, NT72, NT34 (again), NT46 (again), NT5, NT57, NT39, NT59, NT65, NT5, NT1, NT70, NT50, NT41, NT33, NT1, NT62, NT10, NT59, NT1, NT28, NT21, NT1, NT65, NT24, NT71, NT52, NT1, NT62, NT10, NT59, NT1, NT28, NT21, NT1, NT65, NT24, NT71, NT52, NT1, and so on. It seems many are duplicated, so I'll note unique ones.\n\nTerminal symbols:\nt48, t93, t33, t93, t49, t11, t33, t93, t63, t2, t90, t30, t93, t33, t56, t30, t56, t2, t2, t11, t33, t48, t49, t50, t2, t93, t33, t60, t97.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of these terminals. My task is to see if this can be derived from S.\n\nSince S -> NT29 NT21, each string generated by the grammar will have parts derived from NT29 and NT21 separated by a space perhaps? Or it's just a single string with all the generated tokens. Assuming that the string is a concatenation of all the generated terminals from the leftmost to the rightmost.\n\nGiven that, I can approach this problem by breaking down the string into components and seeing if they can be generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nLet me split the string by spaces to get each token:\n\ntokens = [\n't48', 't93', 't33', 't93', 't49',\n't11', 't33', 't93', 't63', 't2',\n't90', 't30', 't93', 't33', 't56',\n't30', 't56', 't2', 't2', 't11',\n't33', 't48', 't49', 't50',\n't2', 't93', 't33', 't60', 't97'\n]\n\nWait, let's check the count. The string has 27 tokens? Or maybe 26? Wait, the string given is:\n\n`t48 t93 t33 t93 t49 t11 t33 t93 t63 t2 t90 t30 t93 t33 t56 t30 t56 t2 t2 t11 t33 t48 t49 t50 t2 t93 t33 t60 t97`\n\nCounting the tokens: Let's see, I'll separate them:\n\n1. t48\n2. t93\n3. t33\n4. t93\n5. t49\n6. t11\n7. t33\n8. t93\n9. t63\n10. t2\n11. t90\n12. t30\n13. t93\n14. t33\n15. t56\n16. t30\n17. t56\n18. t2\n19. t2\n20. t11\n21. t33\n22. t48\n23. t49\n24. t50\n25. t2\n26. t93\n27. t33\n28. t60\n29. t97\n\nOh, so 29 tokens. Hmm, that complicates things because each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols, but the total number may not directly correspond. Hmm, maybe not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the root S -> NT29 NT21, so the string must be derived as NT29... and NT21..., with each part corresponding to the two sentinels.\n\nMaybe I can split the string into two parts: the left part generated by NT29 and the right part by NT21. Or perhaps the entire string is a single unit of S, but S splits into two non-terminals which then must generate the string.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because S produces NT29 followed by NT21, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the left part from NT29 and the right part from NT21.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's 29 tokens, which is an odd number. Hmm, maybe I need to see if the entire sequence can be generated by the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a parsing approach, starting from S and trying to derive the string step by step. But given the length, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me look at the productions for NT29, NT21, etc., and see what terminals are produced.\n\nNT29: I don't see an explicit rule for NT29. Looking through the rules, I see NT29 -> t48. So in the string, 't48' appears, which could come directly from NT29.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 has a rule: NT21 -> t18 and another production: NT21 -> t55. Looking at the string, there's 't18' which matches NT21's production.\n\nSo, the initial split could be S -> NT29 (which is 't48') and NT21 (which is 't18').\n\nThen, after 't48', the rest of the string should be the production from NT21 leading to 't18'.\n\nBut wait, after 't48', the next tokens are t93, t33, t93, t49, etc. So perhaps NT29 is 't48' followed by something that leads to t93, t33, etc.\n\nBut looking at NT29's possible productions, I don't see other rules except NT29 -> t48. So if NT29 is supposed to produce more symbols, that would be a problem because the next token is t93, which is not a terminal but a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar has rules that lead to terminals. For example, NT59 -> t93, which is a terminal. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT59 can produce t93, so t93 is a terminal. So if S starts with NT29, which leads to t48, and then NT21 must produce the rest, but the next token is t93. So maybe I need to consider that NT21's production may include t93 as part of the derivation.\n\nWait, let me check NT21's rules. I see NT21 -> t55 and another NT21 -> NT55. So NT21 can produce t55 or another non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, after 't48', the next token is t93, which is a terminal. But looking at the production rules, t93 is not a terminal in the grammar. Let me check: do any non-terminals produce t93?\n\nLooking through, I see NT59 -> t93. So t93 is produced by NT59. So the next tokens might be derived from NT59.\n\nSo perhaps 't93' is part of a production"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to determine whether the given string \"t48 t93 t33 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t33 t56 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t15 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t20 t60 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The rules are all binary productions, which fits the CNF definition (each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols). The start symbol is S, which goes to NT29 NT59. Each subsequent production breaks down into other non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly correspond to a single terminal symbol. For example, NT24 -> 't24', NT51 -> 't87', and so on. So, the string must be constructed by following the production rules starting from S.\n\nNow, let's consider the string. It's a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Since the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT59, the string should begin with the results of these non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT29 and NT59. Let's see what each of these produces. Looking at the rules, NT29 can be broken down further. Wait, actually, I need to see which rules produce the terminals listed. For instance, NT29 is used in the first step, so I need to find its production.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT29 -> 't48' as per the rules. So, the first symbol in the string is 't48', which matches NT29. \n\nFrom S, we get NT29 and NT59. So, the string starts with t48. Then, the next step would involve NT59. Looking at the rules, NT59 can produce a few possibilities. Wait, let's check the rules again:\n\nLooking for NT59 in the grammar, I see several productions:\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\nNT59 -> NT50 NT34\nNT59 -> ... and others.\n\nIn the string, the next symbols are t93 t33 t87... So, after t48, t93 is next. But wait, in the string, after t48 is t93. So, the first symbol is t48 (from NT29), and the second symbol is t93. So, that suggests that NT59 must produce t93. But looking at the rules, none of the direct productions from NT59 produce a single terminal except perhaps through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for how NT59 can expand into the next symbols. Since NT59 can produce NT0 NT58, or other combinations, perhaps these are combining to produce t93 and t33, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach this systematically. Maybe I should try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules to see if it can be derived.\n\nLet me list out the string:\n\nt48 t93 t33 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t33 t56 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t15 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t20 t60 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63.\n\nSo, the string is 28 symbols long, but the grammar is in CNF, so each step in a derivation produces exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals, which then each produce their next parts, or eventually a terminal).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production in the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT59. So the first two symbols must come from NT29 and NT59. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t48. So, can NT29 produce t48? Yes, per the rules, NT29 -> 't48'.\n\nSo, the first part is OK. Then, what does NT59 produce? The second symbol is t93, so if NT59 can produce t93, that would fit. Looking at the rules for NT59: I see multiple options, but none directly produce a terminal except perhaps through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58. So, t93 would have to come from NT0 or NT58?\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT0 -> 't93'. So NT0 produces t93. Similarly, NT58 -> 't20'.\n\nSo, let's try building this. Starting from S: NT29 (t48) and NT59. Now, NT59 can be NT0 NT58, which are 't93' and 't20'. So the next two symbols would be t93 t20. But in the string, after t48 comes t93 t33... that's a problem because t33 isn't t20. So perhaps NT59 is expanding into other non-terminals that produce t33 and something else.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The second symbol is t93, so if NT59 produces t93, but looking at NT59's rules, none directly produce t93. So perhaps it's through NT59 -> NT50 NT46. Let me check NT50 and NT46.\n\nLooking at NT50: it can produce 't71' and NT50 can also produce NT50 NT46, but that's more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to map out a portion of the string step by step.\n\nAfter t48 (from NT29), the next symbol is t93, which would have to come from NT59. Now, looking at NT59's possible expansions, perhaps it can produce a sequence that starts with t93. Wait, in the rules, NT59 -> NT50 NT46. So, to get t93 from NT59, perhaps one branch produces t93.\n\nLooking at NT50's production: NT50 can produce 't71' or NT41 NT34. Wait, but in the rules, NT50->'t71' and NT50->NT50 NT46, and NT50->'t18'?\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking for NT50: the rules are:\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\nNT50 -> NT71 NT65\nNT50 -> NT51 NT46\nNT50 -> NT10 NT26\nNT50 -> 't71'\nWait, no, according to the provided rules, I think I got that wrong. Looking back, the rules for NT50 are:\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\nNT50 -> NT71 NT65\nNT50 -> NT51 NT46\nNT50 -> NT10 NT26\nNT50 -> 't71'\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules again, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't93' etc., but looking for NT50:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT50 directly. Let me find all rules with NT50.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT50: 't71' is produced by NT50, as per the rule NT50->'t71'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT50 -> 't71' is there? Wait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see NT10 -> 't5 NT19' etc. But for NT50:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT50 directly. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the list again.\n\nWait, I think I may have made a mistake in transcribing the rules. Let me list all the NTs and their productions properly to avoid confusion.\n\nHere's a summary:\n\nS -> NT29 NT59\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT33\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t48 t93 t15 t93 t97 t2 t11 t33 t56 t30 t93 t33 t56 t30 t71 t93 t49 t93 t33 t2 t2 t11 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t15 t60 t97`.\n\nI remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal (A) is rewritten as BC, or A \u2192 S, where S is the start symbol. So each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the entire string must be derived from S. Each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others until all are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it seems to be a sequence of terminals. I'll need to see if this sequence can be built by the grammar.\n\nI notice that many of the non-terminals eventually produce terminals. For example, NT52 \u2192 't63', NT38 \u2192 't35', etc. Some have multiple productions leading to the same terminal. So the grammar allows for sequences that end with specific terminals.\n\nBut it's a bit complex. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from left to right, using the productions to see if I can match it.\n\nAlternatively, I could check the derivation using a parser or a tree, but that might be time-consuming. Let's see if I can find the structure.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of splits. Since each production in CNF splits into two symbols, the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of splits. The given string has 30 tokens, which is 2^5=32, but it's 30 which isn't a power of two. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The number of symbols after each derivation step could lead to a binary tree where each level doubles the number of nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check the structure. Let's count the symbols: 30 tokens. That's not a power of two, so maybe it's not a straightforward structure, but we need to see if it can still be parsed.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for a way to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nLet's start with the first few symbols. The first token is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT34 \u2192 't48', and also NT24 \u2192 't24', but t48 is under NT34. So maybe the first step is part of a production that leads to 't48'.\n\nLooking at NT34, it's defined as NT64 NT55. NT64 might produce something, and NT55 as well.\n\nWait, NT34 \u2192 't64' when looking at the productions. Wait, wait, let me list all the productions and their results.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\nSo NT59 \u2192 't93' 't20' \u2192 't93t20'\n\nSimilarly, NT59 can also become 't11' 't33' and so on.\n\nWait, but each NT can be expanded until it reaches a terminal.\n\nPerhaps building a parse tree is the way to go, but it's quite time-consuming manually.\n\nAnother approach: the terminals in the string are all single characters, each corresponding to a specific production. So the problem reduces to whether the sequence of these terminals can be derived from S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which is the result of a specific NT production.\n\nTherefore, the string can be generated by the grammar if each step in the derivation follows the production rules correctly.\n\nBut this requires that each consecutive pair of steps can be matched by some production.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a series of production steps. Let's try to break the string down into parts that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach would work, but I need to see if the string can be split according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\n1. t48\n2. t93\n3. t15\n4. t93\n5. t97\n6. t2\n7. t11\n8. t33\n9. t56\n10. t30\n11. t93\n12. t33\n13. t56\n14. t30\n15. t71\n16. t93\n17. t49\n18. t93\n19. t33\n20. t2\n21. t2\n22. t11\n23. t15\n24. t93\n25. t20\n26. t2\n27. t93\n28. t15\n29. t60\n30. t97\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern. The string starts with t48, which is from NT34 \u2192 t48. So maybe the first two tokens are part of the expansion of NT34.\n\nNT34 \u2192 't48' 'something'. So NT34 would expand to 't48' followed by another NT that produces the rest.\n\nWait, but NT34's productions are:\n\nNT34 can produce 't48', but looking at the rules, NT34 has one production: NT34 \u2192 't48'. So it can't expand further. Therefore, in the string, 't48' must be the first symbol, and the next symbol must come from another NT.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT34 can only produce 't48', not as a combination. So if the first token is 't48', then the second token must be 'something else' from another NT production.\n\nBut looking at NT29: NT29 \u2192 't48' (also, from the rules). Because NT29 can be 't48' directly.\n\nWait, let's check: NT29 productions.\n\nLooking back: NT34 \u2192 't48' and NT29 \u2192 't48' (from the list, NT29: S->NT29 NT21). Wait, no, NT29 is a non-terminal, but looking at the specific productions:\n\nLooking for NT29: It seems NT29 is not directly defined. Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nWait, is there a production for NT29? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking through the rules:\n\nNT29: Looking at the list, I don't see NT29 being defined as a combination of other NTs. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nThe user listed all the productions. Scanning through, I don't see any NT29 on the left-hand side. Wait, so NT29 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that can produce something else?\n\nWait, looking again: the user wrote all the productions as the lines starting with NT followed by numbers, then the rules, and then for each rule, the right-hand side is either other NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, the user wrote all lines as either NT followed by number \u2192 something, or the NTs are on the left, and the right side can be a mix.\n\nWait, for example, the first line is S->NT29 NT21. Then next line is NT47 -> NT59 NT15, and so on.\n\nWait, then I notice that not every NT has an entry in the rules, unless they're on the left-hand side.\n\nWait, no. Looking carefully, each line starts with a specific NT on the left, and the right side is either a mixture of NT or terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT47 is defined as NT59 NT15, which are both NTs.\n\nBut in the given list, I don't see any production for NT29 in the left-hand side. Therefore, NT29 must be a terminal, as it's being used as a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t48, which matches NT34 \u2192 t48.\n\nBut in the start production, S is NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, the initial step is to replace S with NT29 NT21. So, NT29 and NT21 are both on the left in the first production.\n\nBut if NT29 is a terminal, then S \u2192 t48 (from NT29) followed by NT21.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t48, second is t93, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted NT29 as a non-terminal. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

First, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I have to evaluate is a series of terminals: \"t48 t2 t2 t93 t33 t2 t71 t80 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t30 t56 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63.\" \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will be a full binary tree where each node has exactly two children until the leaves are terminals. Each step in the derivation corresponds to replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols. The string should be derived by a series of such replacements.\n\nFirst, I should note that the entire string must be derived by expanding S step by step until only terminals remain. The given grammar has a start symbol S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first step is to replace S with NT29 NT21. \n\nNow, looking at NT29 and NT21 in the grammar rules. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT29 or NT21 directly, but I do see NT29 \u2192 NT48 NT24, and NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. Hmm, maybe I got that right.\n\nWait, the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, each of those non-terminals needs to be expanded. Let me check the production rules:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 NT48 NT24\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n\nSo, that means S's expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21 \u2192 (NT48 NT24) (NT55 NT52)\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, NT48: Looking through the rules, NT48 doesn't seem to be any of the non-terminals on the left-hand side. Wait, hold on, I need to check all the NT rules provided. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm missing some.

That's one of its productions.\n\nNow, the string starts with t48 t2. Looking at where these appear in the grammar. Let's see the rules for terminals:\n\nLooking through all the terminal symbols, I can list all the terminal replacements:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t93\n- NT34 \u2192 t48\n- NT2 \u2192 t18\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT38 \u2192 t35\n- NT58 \u2192 t20\n- NT20 \u2192 t18? Wait, NT20 is a non-terminal, but according to one of its productions: NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. But in the string, t20 appears multiple times. Wait, wait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, NT20 is a non-terminal, but the production for NT20 is NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. Then, NT2 and NT55 need to be expanded.\n\nBut in the string, I have t20, which is not a terminal. Wait, wait, actually, looking at the string: one of the terms is t20.\n\nWait, but in the grammar rules, I only see NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, but where does t20 come from? Wait, maybe I got confused because in the grammar rules, some non-terminals expand to other non-terminals, but only specific ones expand to terminals. Let me check the rules to see which non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT0 \u2192 't93'\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT52 \u2192 't63'\n- etc.\n\nSo, each rule with a terminal indicates that that non-terminal can be replaced by that terminal. For example, NT5\u2192t93, NT34\u2192t48, NT2\u2192t18, and so on.\n\nSo, any time we see a non-terminal that eventually can be expanded into a terminal, we can replace it with that terminal.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t48 t2 t2 t93 t33 t2 t71 t80 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t30 t56 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t15 t93 t20 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63.\n\nI'll try to match this string by expanding the grammar.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 expands to NT48 NT24.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT48 NT24 NT21.\n\nThen, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nSo now, S \u2192 NT48 NT24 NT55 NT52.\n\nNow, we have four non-terminals. Next step is to expand each of them, checking if any can be terminal.\n\nLooking at NT48: Does NT48 have a production that results in a terminal? I think NT48 doesn't directly, but perhaps NT48 expands further. Wait, in the productions, NT24 is NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, but NT48 is not shown as having a terminal production. Wait, looking back, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, let me check all the NC rules:\n\nLooking at the rules again, the only NT with a terminal is NT5, NT34, NT2, NT58, etc. So NT48 might not have a terminal production. That could be a problem because when expanding, if a non-terminal doesn't have an epsilon production or a terminal, then it can't be a terminal itself. Wait, but in CNF, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and at most one terminal on the right. But in this case, some rules may result in only non-terminals.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the grammar must be such that strings are generated. So every non-terminal must have at least one production that ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, checking again:\n\nLet me see which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 NT0 \u2192 t93\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37 \u2192 both NT65 and NT37 can be further expanded, but no terminals there.\n- NT46"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a set of rules where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that all the non-terminals (nt) are either terminals or produce two non-terminals. Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT29 NT21. The terminals are the 't' followed by some numbers, like 't97', and some are single letters, but most are 't' followed by two digits.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of these 't' terms: t48 t11 t15 t56 t2 t11 t15 t13 t2 t33 t48 t48 t16 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63 t24 t50 t2 t11 t33 t93 t33 t13 t2 t11 t15 t48 t97.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

The first symbol is t48, which should come from NT29, according to the grammar. So let's check where NT29 is defined. Looking through the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 NT34 NT34 (from line NT29: S \u2192 NT29 NT21 is the top rule, but looking for NT29's production). Wait, checking each line, I see NT29 is only in the S production. Wait, no, let me look again. Scanning all the lines, I see NT29 appears in S\u2192NT29 NT21 (the first line).

Let me check again. I see NT24 has two rules: one is NT24->NT10 NT57 and another NT24->'t24'. So it can either produce another pair of non-terminals or the terminal 't24'.\n\nNow, back to the string. The string starts with t48, which comes from NT29. So let's see where NT29 can be defined. From the productions, the only place NT29 is used is in S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S must first produce NT29 NT21. So the string must start with t48 from NT29 and t11 from NT21.\n\nWait, but looking at the production for NT29, I don't see it defined elsewhere. Only S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT29 is not further expanded, which would mean that the terminal 't48' is produced directly. But looking at the terminals, I see NT29 \u2192 't48' is a line: NT29: S \u2192 NT29 NT21, but in the rules, I also see NT29 is a rule?\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, each line is a production. So the first line is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. The line for NT29 is not present except in the S production. Wait, that can't be. Because in CNF, each non-terminal must have productions on the left side. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait, looking more carefully, the first line is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then, the second line is NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15. Third line is NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72, and so on. Then, looking for NT29, I don't see it on the left side of any production except in S's production. So that suggests that NT29 is directly producing 't48' because from S's rule, when you expand S, you get NT29 NT21, and if NT29 is a terminal, that's it. But wait, from the rules, is NT29 a terminal? Because in the given list, only NT24 has a terminal 't24' and NT52 has 't97', etc. I need to check if any non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the lines, NT47 produces NT59 NT15, etc. Now, looking for the terminals: for example, NT20 \u2192 't18' and 't72'\u2014wait, no, the line is NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55 and also in line NT20 \u2192 't72'\u2014Wait, no.

So every step in the derivation will produce exactly two tokens, and the entire string should have a length that is 2^k, where k is the number of steps from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 35 tokens. Let's calculate 2^k. 2^5 = 32, 2^6=64. So 35 is not a power of two. Wait, that's a problem. Because in a context-free grammar in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, so the number of symbols should double each time.\n\nStarting from S (1 symbol), after one expansion: 2 symbols.\nAfter two expansions: 4 symbols.\nAfter k expansions: 2^k symbols.\n\nSo 2^k must equal the number of symbols in the string. Here, 35 is not a power of two. Hence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar, right? Because the number of symbols doesn't match.\n\nWait, wait. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the derivation can consist of a mixture of leftmost and other expansions. No, even then, the total number of symbols at each step always doubles. Because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals. Terminals don't split, so the expansion is recursive. Let's think: Starting with S, which is two NTs.\n\nEach step takes any non-terminal and replaces it with two symbols. So the total number of symbols increases as per the sum of the replacements.\n\nWait, the number of symbols should be a sum of replacements, but some replacements are non-terminals that may also split into two. So maybe it's a binary tree structure, so the number can be 2^k, but perhaps also a variation depending on the depth and rules.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, which means all productions are of the form A->BC or A-> a, but in this case, the grammar has some productions that are both non-terminals, others are a terminal followed by a non-terminal? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see NT29 -> NT48, which is a single terminal. NT49 would be something else, but I see NT29 is actually NT29 -> NT26 NT72. Wait, all the rules except for some are of the form NTxyz -> 't' another number. So some NTs produce a terminal and a non-terminal, others produce two non-terminals.\n\nNo, wait, the CNF grammar should only have productions of the form A->BC or A-> a. So in the given grammar, some rules have two non-terminals on the right. That's okay because NT29 -> NT48 is just a terminal, but I have to see all rules to correct myself.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right.

Some of these are familiar as terminals in the grammar. For example, t48, t97, etc. So I should check which of these terminals are present in the grammar, but wait, looking at the grammar rules, all non-terminals on the right-hand side must derive down to terminals eventually. So the parse has to reduce all these symbols down to terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t48 t90 t30 t71 t11 t49 t93 t33 t2 t48 t11 t15 t24 t2 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t11 t33 t60 t16 t2 t15 t48 t97`\n\nHmm, that's 35 tokens.

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. First, I need to understand the grammar structure and how it builds up strings. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are either to two non-terminals or a terminal. That should help in breaking down the string step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t56 t2 t23 t11 t33 t56 t30 t2 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t30 t93 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t97`\n\nFirst, I should note that the initial symbol is S, which expands into NT29 NT21. So the first two non-terminals should be NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first thing is t48.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT29, I find NT29 -> NT59 NT58. Wait, but in the string, we're starting with t48, which matches NT48 (since NT48 is a terminal). Let me check the productions for NT48. Looking through the rules, I see NT34->NT46 NT55 and NT48? Hmm, wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list, I see that NT29 is a non-terminal. The production for NT29 is NT59 NT47. But in the string, the first token is t48, so maybe the first step is NT29 -> something else. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nOh, wait, the first rule is S -> NT29 NT21. So the first production is S deriving NT29 followed by NT21. The string starts with t48, which could be the result of some production for NT29 or NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29-> NT59 NT47. NT59 and NT47 are non-terminals. Let me see what NT59 and NT47 produce.\n\nNT59: looking through the rules, there are multiple productions, like NT59->NT0 NT58, and others. NT0 is a non-terminal, but in the string, we have t93. Let me check if NT0 can produce t93. Looking at NT0, the only production is NT0->'t93', which is a terminal. So NT0 produces t93.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 has a production NT58->t20 and also NT58->'t20'. So perhaps NT58 can produce t20. But in the string, after t48 (which is NT29), the next is NT56? Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar, step by step, to see if it can be derived.\n\nThe string is: t48 t56 t2 t23 t11 t33 t56 t30 t2 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t30 t93 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t97\n\nLet me break it down into tokens:\n\n1. t48\n2. t56\n3. t2\n4. t23\n5. t11\n6. t33\n7. t56\n8. t30\n9. t2\n10. t93\n11. t20\n12. t2\n13. t93\n14. t33\n15. t30\n16. t93\n17. t49\n18. t80\n19. t93\n20. t20\n21. t2\n22. t23\n23. t93\n24. t49\n25. t20\n26. t2\n27. t49\n28. t20\n29. t2\n30. t33\n31. t60\n32. t97\n\nNow, the start symbol is S, which is NT29 NT21. So the entire string should be the result of NT29 deriving a sequence of terminals and NT21 deriving another sequence, combined.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48, which must come from some production of NT29. From the rules, NT29 is only defined as NT59 NT47. So NT29-> NT59 NT47. So the first two tokens (t48 and t56) must be produced by NT59 and NT47 respectively, but wait, in the string, the first token is t48, then t56.\n\nWait, perhaps NT59 produces t48 and NT47 produces t56? Let me check the rules for NT59 and NT47.\n\nLooking at NT59, one of its productions is NT59->t93. Another is NT59->'t58' NT38, but t58 isn't in the string. There's also NT59->t71 t68 and others, but I don't see a production that directly gives t48 or t56.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting with S: NT29 NT21\n\nThen NT29 -> NT59 NT47\n\nSo now the string is NT59 NT47 NT21\n\nNext, let's process NT21. Looking at NT21's productions: NT21->NT55 NT52 and NT21->'t52'. Since 't52' is a terminal, maybe NT21 can produce 't52'. But in the string, after t93 (assuming NT47 produces 't93'), the next token is t20, then t2, etc. So 't52' might not directly fit.\n\nAlternatively, let's see NT47's productions: NT47->NT15 NT60 and NT47->'t51' and others. Wait, 't60' is a terminal. Looking at the rules, NT40 might be involved. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nStart: S -> NT29 NT21\n\nSo the string starts with NT29 and NT21.\n\nFirst, process NT29:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT47\n\nNow, the string is NT59, NT47, NT21.\n\nNext, process NT21.\n\nNT21 has productions: ->NT55 NT52 (non-terminals) and ->'t52' (terminal). But in the first step, the string starts with t48, which would be a terminal. So perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe the initial step is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string using a top-down approach, trying to match the string with the grammar.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to try to see which parts of the string correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t48, which could be part of a derivation from NT29. From the grammar rules, NT29 is defined as NT59 NT47.\n\nSo maybe t48 comes from NT59 and t56 comes from NT47, but looking at the tokens after that, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT29 must derive a sequence that starts with t48 followed by something else.\n\nBut since I'm stuck, maybe I can look for specific patterns. For example, 't93' appears multiple times. Looking at the rules, NT0->t93, NT19->t93, NT20->t93, NT26->t93, etc. So t93 can come from several non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last token is t97, which comes from NT97 (since T97 is a terminal and the only rule is NT52->'t97'). So the last part must be NT52->t97.\n\nLooking back, let's try to break down the string:\n\nt48 t56 t2 t23 t11 t33 t56 t30 t2 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t30 t93 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t97\n\nPerhaps the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and each terminal symbol is a number followed by a 't' and another number. The grammar seems pretty complex with multiple non-terminals, each expanding into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a set of production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes sense for CNF. My task is to derive the given string and see if it can be produced by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string provided is: \n\nt48 t90 t30 t2 t71 t93 t49 t93 t33 t2 t2 t23 t93 t20 t2 t91 t93 t49 t93 t15 t2 t93 t15 t24 t20 t48 t2 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t97.\n\nI need to parse this string and check if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be consumed. Alternatively, I can try to break down the string step by step, matching the productions.\n\nLet me list out all the productions to see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals:\n\nNT1 -> NT70 NT47\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\nNT46 -> NT2 NT10\nNT15 -> NT71 NT68\nNT59 -> NT33 NT41\nNT65 -> NT50 NT46\nNT5 -> NT72 NT64\nNT57 -> NT68 NT2\nNT39 -> NT46 NT62\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\nNT1 -> NT70 NT47\nNT70 -> NT51 NT36\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\nNT41 -> NT2 NT36\nNT33 -> NT29 NT34\nNT1 -> NT21 NT24\nNT62 -> NT1 NT24\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19\nNT59 -> NT1 NT13\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\nNT1 -> NT20 NT60\nNT65 -> NT37 NT72\nNT24 -> NT10 NT57\nNT71 -> NT10 NT65\nNT52 -> 't97'\nNT13 -> 't50'\nNT37 -> 't2'\nNT34 -> 't60'\nNT51 -> 't87'\nNT39 -> 't80'\nNT60 -> 't49'\nNT41 -> 't16'\nNT26 -> 't13'\nNT65 -> 't56'\nNT5 -> 't93'\nNT34 -> 't48'\nNT0 -> 't93'\nNT50 -> 't71'\nNT52 -> 't63'\nNT24 -> 't24'\nNT38 -> 't35'\nNT58 -> 't20'\nNT20 -> 't18'\nNT20 -> 't72'\nNT29 -> 't48'\nNT24 -> 't91'\nNT47 -> 't51'\nNT1 -> 't73'\nNT71 -> 't90'\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT68 -> 't30'\nNT33 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't11'\nNT36 -> 't20'\nNT19 -> 't33'\n\nWow, that's a lot. So many terminals and non-terminals. Each production for the non-terminals either leads to terminals or other non-terminals. \n\nMy first thought is to write down the string and see if each part can be matched by the grammar. The string is a series of 35 tokens. Each token is a number followed by 't' and another number. So each token is like t48, t90, etc.\n\nI think I should try to see if each token can be derived from the grammar and build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to start from the beginning of the string and see if the first few tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t48 and t90. So, the first production is NT29 \u2192 something. Let's check what NT29 leads to.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT29 \u2192 something? Wait, let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production for NT29 except in the middle part: NT29 \u2192 ... Wait, I don't see any NT29 being split into terminals. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me go through the productions again.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT71 -> NT10 NT65\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT29 isn't listed as a non-terminal with a production. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, in the list, I don't see any rule for NT29 except in the production NT33->NT29 NT34. So NT29 is a non-terminal that's part of another production. But in the grammar, NT29 isn't a left-hand side of any production. That seems like a problem. So, if NT29 is used as the first symbol in the string, but there's no production for NT29, that would mean that the string can't be derived from the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first part is NT29. But if NT29 isn't a non-terminal that can be expanded further, then S can't generate the string. But looking back, the productions show:\n\nNT29 appears only on the right-hand side of NT33's production. It doesn't appear on the left-hand side of any production. So, S \u2192 NT29 NT21 would require that NT29 can be expanded into something else, but since it's not on the left side of any production, it can't be expanded further. That means that in the parse tree, the first symbols after S would be NT29 and NT21, which are both terminals? But wait, NT29 might be a terminal.\n\nWait, checking the NT29 production: it's not in the left side of any production. So, in the grammar, is NT29 a terminal or a non-terminal? Since it's only on the right side of another production, it must be a non-terminal.\n\nBut to be able to derive the string, we need to have NT29 expand into something. Since it's not on the left of any production, it can't. So the only way to have it produce t48 is if NT29 is a terminal symbol and directly corresponds to t48. But in the grammar, does NT29 have a production that's an epsilon? No, the grammar doesn't show that. So in that case, NT29 can't be a terminal, because it's not defined as such. Therefore, the first symbol t48 can't come from NT29.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because the first part is T48, but NT29 can't produce t48 and can't be further expanded.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-599","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. The grammar consists of a series of production rules where each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right. This is characteristic of CNF because it's structured as A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or when B is a terminal. So, that's good, the structure fits the CNF definition.\n\nThe start symbol here is S. The production for S is S -> NT29 NT21, which is two non-terminals. So, the string we're evaluating starts with S, which should derive our input string through a series of production steps.\n\nNow, the input string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t48 t93 t33 t2 t93 t33 t56 t30 t90 t30 t56 t2 t30 t90 t30 t90 t30 t71 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t49 t93 t15 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63`. So, it's a list of terminals, all starting with 't' followed by numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to start with the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step using the productions until I get to the terminals matching the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me list out all the production rules. Each line is a production. So, S is the starting point. From S, it produces NT29 and NT21. Next, I need to see what each of these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT29, according to the grammar, it produces t48. So, when NT29 is derived, it can become 't48'. Similarly, looking at NT21, the productions are:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nSo, NT21 can be derived as follows: NT21 becomes NT55 and NT52, which is 't97'. But wait, NT55 also has productions. Let me check NT55's rules:\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\nNT34 -> 't60'\n\nWait, NT10 has a production: NT10 -> 't19'? Or looking at the grammar, let me check NT10's rules:\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19 -> NT51 NT36? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n...\nWait, let me make sure I parse this correctly.\n\nWait, each line is a production rule for a non-terminal, right? So, for example, NT29 -> NT0 NT58? No, wait, looking again:\n\nLooking back, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nThen:\n\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\n\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\n\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n\nNT2 -> NT5 NT60\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\nNT72 -> NT65 NT37\n\nNT46 -> NT2 NT10\n\nNT15 -> NT71 NT68\n\nNT59 -> NT33 NT41\n\nNT65 -> NT50 NT46\n\nNT5 -> NT72 NT64\n\nNT57 -> NT68 NT2\n\nNT39 -> NT46 NT62\n\nNT59 -> NT10 NT26\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT70 NT47\n\nNT70 -> NT51 NT36\n\nNT50 -> NT64 NT24\n\nNT41 -> NT2 NT36\n\nNT33 -> NT29 NT34\n\nNT1 -> NT21 NT24\n\nNT62 -> NT1 NT24\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19\n\nNT59 -> NT1 NT13\n\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\n\nNT1 -> NT20 NT60\n\nNT65 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT24 -> NT10 NT57\n\nNT71 -> NT10 NT65\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nWait, hold on. I think I made a mistake earlier because some non-terminals have productions that are terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, some entries in the grammar are terminals. For example, looking at NT52:\n\nNT52 -> 't97'\n\nSimilarly, NT56 -> 't56', etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar list, the lines like `NT59 -> NT0 NT58` are productions of NT59 into NT0 and NT58. Then, NT50 -> 't71', etc.\n\nSo each line is a production of the form Non-terminal -> right-hand side.\n\nNow, the input string is a sequence of terminals, which are all of the form 'tX', where X is a number.\n\nSo, to derive the input string, we need to see if starting from S, through a series of productions, we can replace non-terminals with other symbols until we get to all terminals matching the string.\n\nGiven that the input is quite long (37 tokens), it's going to be a long derivation, but that might be manageable if there's a pattern or a sequence that repeats.\n\nLooking at the input string:\n\nt48 t93 t33 t2 t93 t33 t56 t30 t90 t30 t56 t2 t30 t90 t30 t90 t30 t71 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t49 t93 t15 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63\n\nLet me break this down into the sequence of terminals:\n\n1. t48\n2. t93\n3. t33\n4. t2\n5. t93\n6. t33\n7. t56\n8. t30\n9. t90\n10. t30\n11. t56\n12. t2\n13. t30\n14. t90\n15. t30\n16. t90\n17. t90\n18. t71\n19. t56\n20. t2\n21. t73\n22. t50\n23. t2\n24. t49\n25. t93\n26. t15\n27. t2\n28. t48\n29. t60\n30. t16\n31. t2\n32. t15\n33. t60\n34. t63\n\nLooking at this, I notice a pattern. After the initial parts, t48 and t93, it repeats t33, t2, t93, t33, etc., which suggests that there's a cycle or a repeated sub-structure.\n\nLet me see where t48 appears. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT29 produces t48.\n\nSo, looking at S: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo, S can be replaced by NT29 (which is t48) and NT21.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t48, which matches the first symbol.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t93. So, after NT29 becomes t48, what does NT21 become? Let me look at NT21's productions.\n\nNT21: -> NT55 NT52.\n\nLooking at NT52, in the grammar, it becomes 't97'.\n\nSo, NT21 becomes NT55, then 't97'. So, after t48, we have t97. Wait, but the second symbol is t93, not t97. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look further. Because NT55 has a production.

{"custom_id":"request-598","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems like the top symbol is S, which branches into NT29 and NT21. So, the start is S -> NT29 NT21. Each of these NTs (non-terminals) then have their own productions, eventually leading down to terminals, which are words like 't48', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminals: `t48 t2 t11 t15 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t56 t30 t56 t2 t30 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t2 t48 t48 t16 t2 t33 t60 t97`.\n\nMy approach is to try to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two non-terminals or terminals. So, each step in the parse would involve two symbols.\n\nI'll start by noting that the first symbol is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT34 -> NT64 NT55, and NT59 -> NT0 NT58, etc. Wait, maybe I should look for which NT productions lead to 't48'.\n\nLooking through the rules, there's NT29 -> 't48'. So if I have NT29, that can directly produce 't48'. Similarly, NT58 -> 't20', but 't20' isn't in our string as the first symbol. Let's see which symbols correspond to terminals.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t48, t2, t11, etc. Let me go symbol by symbol.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT29 NT21.\n   - So the first step is: S \u2192 | | (Wait, no, it's S splits into NT29 and NT21. So the first two symbols are t48, t2, etc., so the first two symbols are 't48' and 't2'. But NT29 produces 't48', so let's see how to connect.\n\nWait, the string starts with t48 t2. Since S splits into NT29 and NT21, the first symbol is 't48', so NT29 must be producing that. Then NT21 splits into something else.\n\nWait, the first two symbols are 't48' and 't2'. So, after S, the next is NT29 (t48) and then NT21. So the next symbol should be part of NT21's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT21 -> NT55 NT52. So after 't48', we need two symbols from NT21. But the next symbol is 't2', so perhaps that's part of NT52.\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 -> 't63'. So if NT52 is 't63', but the next symbols are t2, t11, etc., that might not fit. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial string is S producing NT29 and NT21, so the string starts with t48 followed by something. The second symbol is 't2'. So we need to see if that 't2' is part of NT21's production.\n\nLooking at NT21, NT21 -> NT55 NT52. Let's see if those can produce 't2' and something. Looking at NT55: NT55 -> 't10' (since NT55 -> NT10 NT34, and then NT10 -> NT5 NT19, NT59 -> ... Wait, this might be getting complicated. Let me try to parse the string again.\n\nAnother approach is to list the tokens and try to match them step by step.\n\nTokens: t48, t2, t11, t15, t90, t30, t2, t56, t2, t73, t50, t2, t15, t56, t30, t56, t2, t30, t2, t2, t2, t56, t2, t2, t2, t2, t48, t48, t16, t2, t33, t60, t97.\n\nSo the initial part is t48. So that must be from NT29, as per S's production. So S: NT29, NT21.\n\nNext, t2 must be part of NT21's production. Let's check NT21's production:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nSo after NT21, we need to parse two symbols: NT55 and NT52.\n\nBut wait, the current string is t48 t2. So after t48 comes t2, which should be the first symbol of NT21's production. So that one symbol can't be split into two, so that suggests a problem. Wait, perhaps the first t48 is the entire NT29, which is one symbol, and the next t2 is part of NT21, but NT21 is two symbols. So maybe t2 is the first part of NT21's production, and the next symbol is part of the second NT in NT21's production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Since the grammar produces two symbols each time, the next symbol after 't48' (which is from NT29) should be the next in the NT21 production. So the second symbol is 't2'\u2014does that match the first part of NT21's production?\n\nLooking at NT21's possible productions: looking for NT21 -> X Y, where X could produce 't2'. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52; so X is NT55, Y is NT52.\n\nDo any production steps for NT55 have 't2' as a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 -> NT10 NT34, etc. Do any of these produce 't2'? Yes: NT62 -> 't2' (since NT62 -> 't2', which is a terminal). But does NT55 produce 't2'? I don't see any direct or indirect production for 't2' from NT55.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I don't see an explicit NT55 -> 't2' production. So perhaps this path is not leading to 't2'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT55 can produce a combination that includes 't2'. Let me check NT55's productions:\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34 (since one of its rules is that). So NT10 is \u2192 NT5 NT19. NT5 is \u2192 't93', and NT19 is 't15'. So that would produce 't93' and 't15', but we need something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps let's backtrack.\n\nThe initial step is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. NT29 is 't48', so the first symbol is matched. The second symbol must be part of NT21's production. So the production for NT21 is, let's see:\n\nNT21 can be NT55 NT52, or another option? Let me check the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the productions for NT21 are:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52\n\nAnd I don't think NT21 has any other productions. So after NT29 which produces 't48', the next symbol must be the start of NT21's production. So the second symbol should be the start of NT55, and the third symbol the start of NT52.\n\nWait, but in our case, the first symbol is 't48' (NT29), then the second is 't2'\u2014so 't2' must be the first symbol of NT55's production. If NT55 can produce 't2' somewhere, that could work.\n\nBut looking through the rules, do any NTs have 't2' as their terminal?\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n\nYes, NT62 -> 't2'. Also, NT47 -> 't51' which is a terminal, but I don't see 't2' in other NTs except NT55's child? Wait, NT55's production is NT10 NT34, and NT34 is NT64 NT55, which eventually leads to NT55's children. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at NT58: NT58 -> 't20', which is a terminal. But none produce 't2'.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is quite long, and it's a sequence of tokens like 't48', 't2', etc., all ending up at some point.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are a lot of NT productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols. For example, NT10 is defined as 't5 NT19', and NT19 is 't15'. Wait, no, looking again, some of the NT productions directly produce terminals. For instance, NT24 -> 't24'. But then others, like NT26 -> 't13', and NT34 -> 't60', and so on. So it looks like the grammar is generating strings where each part corresponds to a terminal symbol, sometimes followed by others.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is composed of a series of these terminal tokens. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the overall structure of the grammar seems to start with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the initial string must start with the symbols derived from NT29 and NT21. Let me see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT29 isn't one of the non-terminals listed. Oh wait, maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's defined by combining smaller non-terminals? Wait, no, the grammar only defines certain NTx productions. Looking back, I see that NT26 has several productions, including NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, which then NT24 and NT38 may further break down.\n\nBut regardless, the string is composed of a sequence of terminals. Each token in the string must correspond to a production in the grammar. Let me see if each token is present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many of the 't' tokens are present as terminals directly produced by some NT productions. For example, 't48' is not listed as a direct production, but wait, in the grammar, I see NT33 \u2192 't23', which is another 't' token. Hmm, but I don't see 't48' as a direct terminal. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT29 is written as 't48'? Or is it an NT that leads to 't48'? Let me go back. Oh, looking at NT24 -> 't24', so 't24' is a terminal. NT47 \u2192 't51', which is another terminal. NT1 \u2192 't73', etc.\n\nBut wait, the given string is:\n\n`t48 t2 t90 t30 t2 t2 t71 t71 t11 t49 t93 t33 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t2 t2 t93 t15 t91 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t33 t48 t97`\n\nI see that the first token is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT that produces 't48'? Let me scan through the rules. \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 't24', so 't24' is a terminal. There's a rule NT33 \u2192 't23', NT38 \u2192 't35', NT20 \u2192 't18', NT47 \u2192 't51', etc. Hmm, 't48' isn't listed as a direct terminal. Did I miss it? Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 't60', which is a terminal. But 't48' doesn't seem to be a terminal directly. Wait, did I make a mistake? Maybe I need to see if 't48' is derived through some chain of productions, not as a direct terminal.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, a production can't be a long string; each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So if 't48' is a terminal, then in the grammar, it must appear as a production on the left-hand side (LHS) of some NT symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the terminals are single letters like 't48', 't2', etc. So perhaps 't48' is a direct production. Wait, in the production NT33, I see NT33 \u2192 't23', but I don't see 't48' directly. Hmm, maybe it's not there.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't48', but according to the grammar, is there any production that leads directly to 't48'? If not, then this string can't be generated.\n\nLet me double-check the grammar rules. Scanning through the list, the 't48' token appears as a terminal in the production NT24 \u2192 't24', but nowhere else. So NT24 is 't24', NT34 is 't60', etc. So 't48' isn't a direct terminal, meaning the grammar doesn't have a production that directly outputs 't48'. Therefore, the first token 't48' can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe some longer chain leads to 't48', but in CNF, each production is only two non-terminals, so each step in the derivation produces exactly two symbols. But a 't' token would have to be a terminal, meaning it must be the result of a production that leads to that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar rules. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't24', which is a terminal. So the string must have 't24' somewhere if NT24 is used. But in the given string, I don't see 't24', I see 't48'. So maybe 't48' is not present, meaning the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in the grammar, some NT produces 't48' through two steps. For example, maybe NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, and NT24 is 't24', NT38 is 't35', but then combining them doesn't give 't48'. Alternatively, maybe some other NT combines to give 't48'.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that the initial string starts with 't48', but the grammar can't produce that because there's no NT that directly produces 't48'.

For example, NT29 -> 't48', which is the first symbol in the given string. So the string starts with 't48', which comes from NT29. Then the next symbol is 't93'. Looking for NTs that produce 't93'. I see NT0 and NT5 produce 't93'. The string after 't48' is 't93', so the next NT should be NT0 or NT5.\n\nWait, the structure after S is NT29 NT21. So S produces NT29 and NT21, which should both be terminals or further non-terminals. If 't48' is NT29, then NT21 should produce 't93'. Let me check if NT21 can produce 't93'. Looking at the rules, NT21 -> NT55 NT52. So NT21 can produce 't93' via NT52. Wait, can I confirm that?\n\nLet me check the rule for NT52: NT52 -> 't63'. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT52 -> 't63' isn't present. Wait, let me check the given rules again. Oh, in the list, NT52 -> 't63' is present. Wait no, looking at the rules, the given grammar includes:\n\n- NT52 -> 't63'\nYes, that's correct. So starting from S, S -> NT29 NT21, with NT29 -> 't48' and NT21 -> NT55 NT52. Now, NT55 is a non-terminal. So let's see NT55: it appears in several rules, like NT55 -> NT10 NT34 and NT55 -> NT10 NT34. Also, NT55 -> NT10 NT34, but more importantly, let's see if NT55 can produce a terminal. Wait, looking at the given productions, I don't see NT55 directly producing a terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, NT55 is defined as NT55 -> NT10 NT34, and NT10 is another non-terminal: NT10 -> NT5 NT19. NT5 is 't93', and NT19 is another non-terminal. Let me check NT19: NT19 -> NT15 NT65, and both of those are non-terminals. Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Maybe I need to track the entire string and see if it can be broken down into the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of starting from S, I should look at the string structure. The first symbol is 't48' which must come from NT29. Then the next symbol is 't93', which could come from NT0 or NT5. Let's see the string: t48 t93 t15 t48 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t15 t48 t48 t93 t49 t20 t2 t93 t33 t60 t16 t2 t11 t33 t60 t63.\n\nWait, let's parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t48 (from NT29). Then t93: possible NT0 or NT5. Let's assume it's NT0. Then the next symbol after t93 is t15. Let's see what NT0 can produce. NT0 -> 't93', so it only produces that terminal, but in the string, it's followed by t15, which suggests that T0 is followed by another NT that produces t15. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT15 is somewhere.\n\nWait, looking at the symbols after 't93' is 't15', so we have t93 t15. So after t93, which is NT0, the next symbol is t15, which would require the next NT to produce t15. But in the nt productions, I don't see a direct production for a non-terminal to produce 't15'. Wait, let's check NT19: NT19-> 't15'.\n\nSo if after NT0 (t93) we have NT19 -> 't15'. That would make sense: t93 followed by t15 would require NT0 -> 't93' and then NT19 -> 't15'. So so far, the first four tokens are:\n\nt48 (NT29) -> t48\n\nt93 (NT0) -> t93\n\nt15 (NT19) -> t15\n\nt48 (NT29 again?)\n\nWait, but in the string, after t15 we have t48 again. So the structure would be S -> NT29 NT21, and then NT21 would produce t93 (from NT50?), but I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is incorrect. Let me think differently. Since S -> NT29 NT21, and the first symbol is t48, which is NT29. So the next symbol after that must come from NT21. Let's look at NT21: NT21 -> NT55 NT52. So the next symbol after t48 is from NT21, which consists of NT55 and NT52. So looking at the string, it's t48 t93 t15. So after t48, the next symbol is t93, which is the first part of NT21, which is NT55. But wait, in the production, NT21 is NT55 and NT52, so both must be processed.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I need to reconstruct the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to list all the symbols:\n\nString: [t48, t93, t15, t48, t93, t63, t2, t56, t2, t2, t2, t56, t2, t2, t23, t93, t49, t20, t2, t15, t48, t48, t93, t49, t20, t2, t93, t33, t60, t16, t2, t11, t33, t60, t63]\n\nLength: Let's count. 32 symbols. Hmm, which might not be very long, but parsing it without an algorithm is tough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's production rules for terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt48, t9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-632","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of non-terminals. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let me look through the production rules. It seems that most of the non-terminals on the left side (like S, NT47, NT26, etc.) produce two non-terminals on the right side. The terminal characters are mostly letters like 't' followed by numbers, except for a few like 't97', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t71 t2 t11 t33 t48 t97 t91 t50 t2 t24 t11 t49 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t15 t2 t2 t93 t33 t24 t35 t2 t49 t11 t15 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t60 t63`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from left to right, trying to apply the productions to see if the string can be entirely consumed.\n\nStarting with the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the production for S: S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first two symbols in the string should match the first part of the productions of NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't48'. Let's find which non-terminals produce 't48'. From the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 t48 and also looking more carefully, NT24 \u2192 t48. Wait, but in the productions, NT24 has multiple entries: one is NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, another is NT24 \u2192 t24. So NT24 can produce 't24', but also NT24 itself can produce further non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I need to check each production for each non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nI see NT24 has a production: NT24 \u2192 t24. So, if NT24 \u2192 t24, then the first symbol 't48' doesn't match that. So where does 't48' come from? Let me check the grammar. Yes, looking at the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 t24, and NT60 \u2192 t48, and NT63 \u2192 t60 (wait, no, looking through, I see NT41 \u2192 t16, NT24 \u2192 t24, NT47 \u2192 t51, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing NT34 producing 't48' and maybe something else. Wait, looking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT34 can produce 't48' (twice, I think). Let me check: yes, two entries where NT34 \u2192 t48. Hmm. Also, I think NT96 might have a production but maybe not here.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the productions for NT34 are: NT34 \u2192 t48 and also NT34 \u2192 t48 again. So NT34 can directly produce 't48'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Let's see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nLooking at NT29: What's its production? I see NT29 is part of the string, and in the productions, I don't see NT29 \u2192 any specific terminal directly. Let's check: looking through the productions, I see NT29 is only on the left side of a production, like S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So NT29 must produce something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the list wrong. Let me list the productions where NT is on the left:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n- NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38\n- NT29 is in S's production, and other productions like NT29 \u2192 t48? Wait, checking the list again, I don't see NT29 having a production other than appearing in S. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT26 as a left side, NT29 as a left side, etc. But I don't see an explicit production for NT29 except being part of S. So perhaps NT29 has other productions that I missed, but looking through the list again, I don't see it. That could mean that NT29 only produces S, which isn't helpful because S is the start symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me read the list again:\n\nLooking through, I see each line is a production, the left side followed by the right side.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15.\n\nSo, NT29: Is there any production for NT29? Let me search each line for NT29 as the left side:\n\n- S \u2192 NT29 NT21: that's the only line where the left side is NT29. So NT29 only has that production, which is two non-terminals.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which would mean that the first part of S's production is NT29 producing a non-terminal, and NT21 producing another. So now, looking at the string, the first symbol is 't48', so perhaps S's production requires that the first symbol comes from NT29's production, but since NT29 only leads to NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT21, we have to parse that.\n\nWait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this step by step, trying to break down the string.\n\nThe first symbol is 't48', which we established can come from NT34 \u2192 t48, but how does S produce that?\n\nWait, perhaps starting with S, which is S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string starts with t48, which must come from NT29's first production. But NT29 only produces NT29 and NT21, so NT29 can only produce a string of non-terminals. But then, how does that connect to the first symbol being 't48'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again: the grammar is in CNF, so every production on the left is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So S can only directly generate a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nIn this case, S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so it produces two non-terminals. The string starts with t48, which suggests that the first element in this pair is t48. But NT29 can't produce a terminal; it only produces non-terminals. So perhaps we need to see if NT29 can produce something that starts with t48.\n\nWait, that's not possible because NT29 only has the production NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT21, which are both non-terminals. So maybe the string starts with t48 and the next symbol is something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check NT29's productions again. Actually, looking through the entire list, I don't see any production for NT29 other than being in S's production. So perhaps the only way to get t48 is through another production that leads into NT29.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's list all the NTs and see where they can produce terminals:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't70' (from NT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47)\n- NT21 \u2192 't18' and 't15 t55' (looking through, I see NT21's production lines)\n- NT47 \u2192 't51'\n- NT59 \u2192 't50'\n- NT65 \u2192 't56'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' (from NT24 \u2192 t24)\n- Also, wait, looking again, I see NT59 \u2192 t50 is one line, and another line says NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26, and another line says NT59 \u2192 NT59 NT26 etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused because earlier I thought NT24 can produce 't24' directly, but in reality, in the list, the production is NT24 \u2192 t24, so that's correct.\n\nSo, going back, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first part of S is NT29, which only produces NT29 and NT21, but none of these directly produce t48.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me try a different approach.

{"custom_id":"request-635","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a standard form for CFGs, I can use that structure to analyze it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a list of productions where each non-terminal on the left expands into exactly two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S, and the non-terminals seem to be prefixed with NT followed by numbers except for the terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers, some of which are also connected to others.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these 't' terms. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions.\n\nGiven the depth of the grammar (each production splits into two, and non-terminals may further split), it's impractical to perform a full derivation manually. However, I can use a few strategies:\n\n1. **Check the structure**: The string should be made up of any combination of the terminals as allowed by the grammar. Since the non-terminals include 't'-prefixed terms, I can map each 't' part to see if it's in the production rules.\n\n2. **Look for possible substitutions**: The string seems long, but some parts might correspond to single symbols. For example, 't71' appears twice. Looking at the grammar, 't71' is the result of certain productions. I can check which non-terminals produce 't71'. From the grammar, NT71 is defined as NT10 and NT65. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT51 -> 't87', NT19 -> 't15'? Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me clarify the grammar. Each production is in the form NTxx -> NTyy NTzz, except the direct terminals. So for example, NT59 -> NT0 NT58, and so on. Terminals are only when a production directly results in a 't' term, like NT51 -> 't87'.\n\nWait, but in the string provided, the user lists the terminals as:\nt48, t93, t15, t56, etc.\n\nSo, each token in the string is a terminal. Now, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For instance, NT59 can produce 't51' (I think I saw NT57 -> 't68' and others, but maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, let's see: the grammar has lines like NT51 -> 't87', NT19 -> 't15', NT68 -> 't30', etc.\n\nSo, in the string, we have 't48' appearing. Looking at the grammar, if a production exists where a non-terminal generates 't48', then 't48' can be part of the string. Similarly for other terms.\n\nSo, let me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt48, t93, t15, t56, t30, t2, t71, t80, t2, t56, t2, t2, t93, t15, t60, t63, t91, t50, t2, t15, t24, t56, t2, t2, t2, t93, t63, t2, t90, t30, t56, t2, t2, t15, t60, t97.\n\nThis is quite a long string. But considering that each non-terminal step can split into two, the number of symbols can double at each step. So, starting from S, the first step would produce two non-terminals: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, I can try to see if each step in the string can be generated by looking at the possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the non-terminals' splits. But considering the string is 45 tokens long, this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if all the terminals in the string can be generated by the grammar. For example, 't97' is only produced by NT21, and 't2' is produced by NT28, which in the grammar is defined as NT52 NT28. Wait, looking back: the grammar has NT28 -> 't37' and 't72', right? Wait no, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are many lines. For example, NT28 -> NT52 NT28? No, wait: looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I can list which non-terminals generate which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't30'\n- NT71 -> 't90'\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n- NT72 -> 't65' (looking at NT72: NT72 is defined as NT65 NT37, but wait, in the grammar, I see NT29 -> NT48 NT51, etc.)\n\nWait, this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of 't97' suggests that NT21 must produce it. Let me check the grammar: looking for NT21.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nAnd NT55 is defined as NT10 NT34, and NT34 is NT64 NT55, which itself is recursive. Wait no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, looking for NT21, I see:\n\nIn the given grammar under \"Production Rules\":\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72\n\nNT37 -> NT46 NT59\n\nWait, this might get too tangled. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct the parse tree for the string. Starting with S, S produces NT29 NT21.\n\nThen, each NT29 and NT21 must be expanded further. Let's look at NT29:\n\nFrom the grammar: NT29 -> NT48 NT51. So NT29 must produce those two non-terminals, which themselves can be expanded.\n\nNT48: Looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT48? Hmm. Wait, the grammar lines only go up to NT64 or other, but I need to check all lines. Let me scan the production rules for NT48.\n\nLooking through all the production lines, I don't see NT48 defined. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- NT47 -> NT59 NT10\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34\n\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n\n- NT37 -> NT46 NT59\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\n- Wait, I don't see NT48 being defined as a production of any non-terminal. So if NT29 -> NT48 NT51, but NT48 isn't defined anywhere, that would be invalid. Hence, the production of NT29 would require NT48, which isn't a valid non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking again, the production for NT29 is in the grammar: NT29 is defined as NT48 NT51, but I don't see NT48 being a left-hand side of any production. So, this suggests that the grammar cannot generate the string because NT29 can't produce NT48, which is required for the string's 't48' and 't93' terms.\n\nWait, but wait: looking further, perhaps NT48 is another non-terminal. Hmm, no. In the given grammar, I'm seeing non-terminals as NT followed by numbers, but in each production, the left-hand non-terminal is on the left, and right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals.\n\nWait, the given grammar seems extensive. Let me make sure I look for NT48.\n\nLooking through all the production lines:\n\nLooking for any line starting with NT48.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That simplifies things because each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several NT (non-terminal) productions. Some of them have the form NTXY \u2192 NTXZ NTYU, which break down each NT into two other NTs, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nThe target string is: `t48 t11 t15 t73 t50 t2 t93 t15 t23 t2 t56 t2 t2 t11 t15 t13 t2 t49 t20 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t91 t80 t93 t15 t91 t35 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t48 t97`.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens, but each word corresponds to a terminal symbol. My goal is to see if this can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So after the first step, we have NT29 and NT21.\n\nNow, each of these NTs will need to be expanded. Looking at the productions for NT29 and NT21, I see they can be broken down into other NTs or terminals. Let me track each part.\n\nNT29: I check the productions and see it can go to NT0 NT58. NT0 can go to NT5 NT93, and NT59 is one of the options. Wait, NT93 can be expanded further? Let me look up NT93. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT93. Oh, but some of the NTs might be terminals. Looking at the list, I see some NTs correspond directly to terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some NTs map to terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't93', NT50 -> 't71', NT52 -> 't63', etc. So when I see an NT that has a direct terminal production, I can replace it.\n\nSo, starting again, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Let's expand NT29 first.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT93.\n\nNT5 is a terminal 't93', and NT93? Wait, looking through the productions, I see that NT59 can go to 't93', but no NT93. So maybe NT93 is actually a terminal? Or perhaps it's another NT that produces a terminal. Wait, in the list, I don't see NT93 appearing as a production, but looking at the terminal mappings, I see NT93: Wait, no, the last line I see is NT33 -> 't23', so maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the NTs. Let me list the NTs and their productions.\n\nLooking through the productions, many are of the form NTXY \u2192 NTXZ NTYU.\n\nFor example, NT5 \u2192 't93', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT15 -> 't71', NT21 -> 't18' etc. So whenever I encounter an NT that's mapped to a terminal, I can replace it with that terminal.\n\nSo, let me start processing the initial S.\n\nS expands to NT29 NT21. Now, I need to expand NT29 and NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT93.\n\nWait, but NT93 is another NT. Let's see, in the grammar, is there a production for NT93? Checking through, I don't see NT93 in the list as a starting NT; instead, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar list, I notice that some NTs like NT5, NT15, etc., produce tuples, but NT93 is not listed. So maybe NT93 can be further expanded. Wait, actually, in the list, some NTs are listed as producing tuples, like NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34, etc. But NT93 is not present. So perhaps I made an error earlier.\n\nWait, let me try to map each NT to see if it's a terminal or can be expanded.\n\nLooking back, the productions include NT59 \u2192 't93' and NT93 doesn't appear as a starting symbol. Hmm, perhaps NT65 \u2192 't56', NT24 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all NTs and their possible expansions to terminals and other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to create a parse tree for the string and see if it conforms to the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t48. Let's see, where does t48 come from?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT48 is a terminal, and it's present in several productions as a terminal. For example, NT42 isn't a terminal, but NT48 is.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT48 as a terminal, but I do see NT58 \u2192 't20', NT20 \u2192 't18', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-652","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to represent context-free grammars where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that because all the rules are two non-terminals on the left and either two non-terminals or strings of terminals on the right.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. It's a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume correspond to specific terminals. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the rules have two non-terminals on the left, except for some that directly correspond to terminals when expanded. For example, NT59 can sometimes produce a terminal like 't48' or 't59', etc. The string provided has a mix of these terminals, so I'll need to see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by identifying the sequence of steps that could lead to the given string. Maybe it's easier to parse the string in reverse, starting from the end and seeing if it can be derived back to the start symbol. Since the grammar is CNF, each rule application reduces the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nThe string is: t48 t11 t15 t2 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t15 t48 t63 t91 t50 t2 t11 t15 t73 t50 t2 t11 t15 t11 t49 t93 t15 t60 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t60 t97.\n\nLooking at the last token, it's 't97'. I remember that in the grammar, NT52 \u2192 't97'. So the last symbol is 't97', which suggests that the last production must be NT52 \u2192 t97. So perhaps the last non-terminal before the string ends is NT52, which produces 't97'.\n\nBefore that, the string has 't50' before 't97'. So the part before 't97' would be something that leads to 't50 t97'. Looking at the grammar, NT52 \u2192 t97, but I'm not sure where 't50' comes from. Alternatively, let's look for a production that can lead to 't50' and somehow connect back to the rest.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT19 \u2192 't15'. But that's different. Let me check other possible endpoints. The string ends with t97, which comes from NT52. Before that is t50, which could come from NT50 \u2192 t71. Hmm, but how does t71 connect to t50? Or perhaps t50 is part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string before the last few symbols: ...t50 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t60 t49 t50...\n\nWait, let's check where 't49' comes from. NT60 \u2192 t49. So the string contains t49 t93, which I know comes from NT50 \u2192 t93. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string from the start. Let's see: the first symbol is t48. Looking at the grammar, t48 is from NT24 \u2192 t48. Wait, no, let me check: looking at the grammar, the rule NT24 \u2192 t24 is correct, but t48 comes from NT47 \u2192 t51, or wait, no. Let me cross-reference.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let's check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at NT47: NT47 \u2192 NT59 NT15. Then NT59 can produce t48 when applied to NT47. So NT47 \u2192 t51, then NT59 \u2192 t48. Or wait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to their terminal symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar has several production rules that produce terminals. For example, NT59 \u2192 t48, t59, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I should look for each production rule and see which rules produce a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT59 has two productions: one that produces 't0' and another that produces 't59'. Wait, looking back, I see NT59 has two options: NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (both non-terminals) and NT59 \u2192 NT20 NT26.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar provided, the first line is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. Then each subsequent line is NTxxx \u2192 something, sometimes with non-terminals and sometimes with terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the production rules and categorize them into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree from the top down, but with such a long string, that might be impractical. Alternatively, I can check the string for any obvious inconsistencies.\n\nWait, the string starts with t48. So I need to see if the grammar can generate t48 as the first symbol. Looking for a production where NTx \u2192 t48.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT24 \u2192 t24, so that would produce 't24', but we have 't48' first. So perhaps that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe NT47 can produce t51, which is 't51' isn't in the string. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't48' is produced by NT24 in the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT24 has several rules.

{"custom_id":"request-672","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. Each production rule looks like A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers, like t50. The start symbol is S, which immediately expands into NT29 NT21. So the process of generating the string starts from S and applies the production rules until only terminals are left.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t2 t71 t80 t87 t20 t73 t50 t90 t30 t50 t87 t20 t93 t20 t93 t15 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t30 t24 t48 t48 t16 t2 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t15 t60 t63`. It's a series of 't' followed numbers, which are terminals. \n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and apply the productions recursively, checking if we can derive this string. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string top-down, symbol by symbol, seeing if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet me try parsing the string. The start symbol must be S, which produces NT29 NT21. So the first step is to split the string into parts that match NT29 and NT21, then recursively check those parts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t48 and t2. So does NT29 produce t48? Looking at the productions of NT29, from the grammar, I see that NT29 produces NT59 NT48, because in the grammar, under NT29, I think there's a production like NT29 -> NT59 NT48. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided grammar rules, I don't immediately see a rule for NT29. Let's scan the rules: I see NT59 -> NT0 NT58, NT72 -> NT65 NT37, etc. No, NT29 doesn't directly produce t48. Hmm, wait, maybe NT29 can only produce non-terminals. So to get t48, we have to look for rules where a non-terminal produces t48 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT29: the only production is NT29->... Wait, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT29 -> NT59 NT48. So NT29 can produce NT59 followed by NT48. But NT48 is a terminal? Let me check the rules. Wait, looking back, some rules are terminal symbols. For example, NT10 -> NT5 NT19, but others are directly mapping to 't' symbols.\n\nWait, looking carefully, under NT24, one of the productions is NT24->NT24 NT57? No, maybe I'm mixing up. Wait, actually, let me recheck all rules carefully.\n\nWait, the rules provided are a bit dense.

{"custom_id":"request-676","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most productions are two non-terminals on the right side, except some have terminals, which I suppose are the leaves.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t48 t18 t49 t50 t2 t24 t90 t30 t71 t11 t49 t11 t15 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t49 t11 t33 t2 t93 t63 t2 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t48 t63`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived by the grammar. That is, can the start symbol S generate this string through a series of productions.\n\nIn CNF, the way to check if a string is generated is to ensure that it can be parsed using the grammar's rules without any leftover symbols, and that the derivation is valid.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or two terminals. Therefore, the string must have a length that is a sum that can be broken down according to the grammar's structure.\n\nHowever, given the complexity of the grammar, it's not feasible to manually build a parse tree for the entire string. Instead, I can look for patterns or maybe use a different approach.\n\nAnother idea is to see if each symbol in the string can be derived by some production. Alternatively, I can try to find a way to split the string into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me look at some of the productions and see if the terminals appear in the right places.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT21\n- NT47 -> NT59 NT15\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT72\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55\n- NT64 -> NT59 NT37\n- NT65 -> NT15 NT65\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34\n- NT34 -> NT64 NT55\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT60\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37\n- NT46 -> NT2 NT10\n- NT15 -> NT71 NT68\n- NT59 -> NT33 NT41\n- NT65 -> NT50 NT46\n- NT5 -> NT72 NT64\n- NT57 -> NT68 NT2\n- NT39 -> NT46 NT62\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n- NT55 -> NT10 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT70 NT47\n- NT70 -> NT51 NT36\n- NT50 -> NT64 NT24\n- NT41 -> NT2 NT36\n- NT33 -> NT29 NT34\n- NT1 -> NT21 NT24\n- NT62 -> NT1 NT24\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT59 -> NT1 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- NT1 -> NT20 NT60\n- NT65 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- NT71 -> NT10 NT65\n- NT52 -> 't97'\n- NT13 -> 't50'\n- NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT34 -> 't60'\n- NT51 -> 't87'\n- NT39 -> 't80'\n- NT60 -> 't49'\n- NT41 -> 't16'\n- NT26 -> 't13'\n- NT65 -> 't56'\n- NT5 -> 't93'\n- NT34 -> 't48'\n- NT0 -> 't93'\n- NT50 -> 't71'\n- NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT38 -> 't35'\n- NT58 -> 't20'\n- NT20 -> 't18'\n- NT20 -> 't72'\n- NT29 -> 't48'\n- NT24 -> 't91'\n- NT47 -> 't51'\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT71 -> 't90'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT68 -> 't30'\n- NT33 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't11'\n\nNow, looking at these productions, many of them directly produce terminal symbols, which I can match against the string.\n\nFor example, NT24 -> 't24' directly matches the symbol 't24' in the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT59 -> 't13' would match 't13' if present.\n\nLooking at the string, I can see that it's filled with various 't' symbols. Some of these have corresponding productions in the grammar.\n\nFor instance, 't48' appears, and looking back, I see that NT29 -> 't48' is a production. Similarly, NT34 -> 't60' is another.\n\nSo, the string is composed mostly of terminals, each of which might be matched by a production. But the challenge is to see if the whole string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S, applying the rules step by step.\n\nGiven the size of the string, there's no way manually to check each step, so perhaps a better approach is to consider whether the grammar allows the necessary terminals in the correct order.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a parsing problem, where we can either use recursive descent or another parsing algorithm tailored for CNF grammars. However, without implementing that, I can look for a pattern or see if each terminal in the string can be produced by appropriate productions, possibly in the right combination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in CNF, each production expands a non-terminal into two symbols, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals. So, for a string of length n, the parse tree must have (n-1) internal nodes, each corresponding to a production, and each non-terminal must split into two parts.\n\nGiven that the grammar is large and the string is long, it's more practical to look for a pattern that uses the given productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look at some of the longer sequences to see if they can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, after the initial 't48', the next is 't18'. I see that NT20 -> 't18', so that could be matched by NT20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe through a chain of expansions.\n\nSimilarly, 't49' could be matched by NT60, as NT60 -> 't49'.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the most efficient way.\n\nAnother approach: Since this is a context-free grammar in CNF, we can use the fact that in CNF, the language can be recognized by a bottom-up parser or top-down with memoization. But given the problem, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed level by level, combining symbols as per the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the grammar defines certain sequences of terminals, perhaps I can find a way to split the string into such sequences.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are 't48 t18 t49 t50 t2 t24 t90 t30 t71 t11 t49 t11 t15 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t49 t11 t33 t2 t93 t63 t2 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t48 t63'.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\n1. Start with t48: according to the grammar, looking at the productions, I see NT29 -> 't48', so somewhere in the derivation, the start S must expand into NT29 NT21, which would then have to produce t48 and something else.\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-694","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF entails. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals (or A could be a terminal, but in that case, it's a terminal production). However, in some definitions, all productions must have two non-terminals on the right side if A is a non-terminal, so terminals can't appear except as single productions. Wait, no, in standard CNF, terminals can appear as single symbols, but the production rules for non-terminals must consist of exactly two non-terminals. So, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. Terms like S \u2192 NT1 can't exist because they have a single non-terminal on the right, unless the non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions except for the start symbol must be A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can have a mix if needed, but in our case, the grammar starts with S, and all the productions from non-terminals on the left side seem to be two non-terminals each, except maybe the ones where a terminal is explicitly defined.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I see some rules where the right-hand side is a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT59 -> NT0 NT58. Not exactly\u2014it's an NT followed by a terminal and another NT? Wait, no, in the grammar, each production seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except when they are terminals. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, checking the grammar provided, I see entries like:\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT23\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\nWait, but some of these have, for example, NT39 -> NT46 NT59. All seem to be two non-terminals on the right side except NT65 -> NT15 NT65, which is correct because both are non-terminals. Similarly, NT1 -> NT21 NT24: two non-terminals. So I think all the non-terminals have productions with two non-terminals on the right, meaning that any terminal symbol in the string must be directly generated by a production with one terminal on the right. But wait, I also see some rules where a terminal is part of the right-hand side, like NT59 -> NT0 NT58. Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT59 -> NT0 NT58, but NT0 is a terminal because in the rule NT0 -> 't93', right? So, NT59 can produce a terminal and a non-terminal, which would mean that the overall grammar allows mixtures, but in Chomsky Normal Form, it's supposed to have two non-terminals on the right unless it's the start symbol.\n\nHmm, maybe the given grammar isn't strictly in CNF because some rules have a terminal on one side and a non-terminal on the other. Wait, but wait, looking again: the rules seem to have either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. For example, NT59->NT0 NT58, where both NT0 and NT58 are non-terminals, but NT0 is actually a terminal because there's a production NT0->'t93'. So in effect, NT59's production can generate a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which would mean that the overall grammar may not be in proper CNF. Or perhaps the grammar can have a mix where some productions lead to terminals and others lead to non-terminals, but each production for a non-terminal must be a combination of two non-terminals. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, but maybe in this problem, the key is that the given grammar can still generate any language up to a point, even if it's not strictly in CNF, as long as the production conditions hold.\n\nOkay, moving on. The problem gives a string that is a sequence of terminals, and we need to check if it's possible for this string to be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t48 t93 t97 t2 t93 t20 t2 t91 t80 t48 t60 t93 t49 t20 t2 t2 t24 t80 t11 t15 t91 t90 t30 t90 t30 t71 t80 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t15 t48 t63`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the string is long, but perhaps I can parse it by considering possible parse trees or using some method like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe a better approach is to see how the string can be broken down into the terminal sequences generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can track the possible non-terminals that can generate each part of the string step by step.\n\nLet me see: The first symbol is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a non-terminal that can directly produce 't48', but from the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions where a terminal appears:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58, where NT0 is 't93', and NT58 is checked: NT58 -> NT52 NT28, which leads to NT52 being 't63' (since NT52 -> 't63'), and NT28 -> NT37 NT72, which are both non-terminals, but some of their productions end up as terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find all non-terminals that can generate each terminal in the string, and see if the sequence can be built step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to list all the rules for each non-terminal and see if each symbol in the string can be generated, possibly building a parse tree.\n\nFirst, let me list all the production rules and see where the terminals like t48, t93, etc., appear.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n  NT0 -> 't93'\n  NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n  NT37 -> 't2'\n  NT72 -> NT65 NT37 \u2192 wait, NT72 -> NT65 NT37, but NT37 is 't2', and NT65 -> 't56' (Wait, checking NT65's rules: NT65->NT56 NT46, and NT56 ->'t56', NT46-> something else. Wait, no: NT56 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal? Wait, checking the list:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nI think I need to map each NT to whether it's a terminal or not.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT0 -> 't93'\nNT28 -> NT37 NT72 \u2192 if NT37 is a terminal, then NT28 is a production of a terminal and another symbol. But since NT37 is 't2', a terminal, and NT72 is another non-terminal. So NT28 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT58-> NT52 NT28, both are non-terminals except when they produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's identify which non-terminals are terminals.\n\nA non-terminal is a terminal if in any of its rules it is on the right-hand side with a terminal symbol. Looking through the given rules:\n\n- NT0 is a terminal: NT0 \u2192 t93\n- NT21 is a terminal: NT21 \u2192 t18\n- NT71 is a terminal: NT71 \u2192 t90\n- NT91 and others?

{"custom_id":"request-695","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar provided is in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t56 t2 t23 t2 t93 t97 t2 t2 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t2 t11 t33 t30 t93 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t93 t63 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t49 t20 t2 t33 t48 t97`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some of these tokens are non-terminals, but wait, in CNF, the right-hand sides can only have terminals or two non-terminals. So maybe some of these tokens are non-terminals and others are terminals?\n\nWait, the grammar symbols are like NT47, NT29, etc. So the terminals seem to be the 't' tokens, but their numbers might correspond to some non-terminals. Let me list all the non-terminals and terminals to understand better.\n\nNon-terminals are all the NT numbers, like NT2, NT4, NT5, NT6, etc., up to NT97? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are the NT... symbols, such as NT2, NT4, NT5, etc., and the terminals are the 't...'. So the terminals are t2, t56, t23, t93, t97, t20, etc.\n\nSo each 'tX' is a terminal, and the NT... are non-terminals. So when the string is being generated, we have to replace the non-terminals with either terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t48, which is a terminal. So I can check if any production directly starts with that, or it might be derived through other rules.\n\nLet me look at the grammar more carefully. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the start symbol S derives to two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. Then each of those can produce more.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar can be expanded into either two non-terminals or a terminal, based on the rules.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, it must either be a direct production of a non-terminal or result from deriving through multiple steps.\n\nI think the best way is to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar to see if it can be derived step by step.\n\nLet me consider the structure. The string starts with t48, which is a terminal. So I need to find a production that starts with NT48 \u2192 t48. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces t48 from NT48. Wait, no, actually, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, there's NT58 \u2192 t20, and NT56 comes from NT50 and NT46.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a non-terminal that can produce t48. Looking through the rules, the only place t48 comes is from NT58 and perhaps NT51? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 t48. So the production is NT29 \u2192 t48. Oh, so NT29 can be replaced by t48 directly. Similarly, NT39 \u2192 t80, etc.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t48, which corresponds to NT29 \u2192 t48. So the first step would be that the first part of the string is derived from NT29.\n\nThen, the next token is t56. So in the grammar, is there a production that starts with NT56? Let's look.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 t13, NT56 seems not to be a terminal. Wait, let me find if there's a rule for NT56. Hmm, I see NT56 is involved in rules like NT26 \u2192 t26? Wait no.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all the non-terminals and see which ones produce the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a sequence of terminals, and try to see if each terminal can be the result of non-terminals expanding according to the grammar.\n\nSo let's take the first few tokens: t48, t56, t2, t23, t2,...\n\nLooking at t48, as I found, that's from NT29 \u2192 t48.\n\nSo the first symbol is NT29. Now, what can NT29 produce? Let's check the rules.\n\nIn the grammar, NT29 doesn't appear as a left-hand side in any production. Or wait, looking at the list, I see NT29 is on the right-hand side of the production NT29. Wait, actually, each production is a non-terminal on the left.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one. I see that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and each rule on the left starts with NT. Some of these have more NTs, like NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, so I think they eventually have to break down into 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: t48 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t11 t33 t13 t2 t33 t73 t50 t2 t11 t33 t72 t49 t50 t2 t56 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t48 t60 t93 t49 t20 t2 t11 t33 t48 t63.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this from the beginning.

Wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any NT68. So perhaps the string token \"t68\" can only come from a production where the NT on the left becomes t68, but it's not present. Hmm, but the string given doesn't have t68, so maybe I don't need to worry about that.\n\nWait, in the string provided, the last part is ... t50 t2 t56 t2 t48 t60 t16.

But perhaps the parser doesn't have to derive all the way to a terminal at each step\u2014wait, but in this problem, the string is in the form of a series of terminals, so it must be that the entire string can be recognized by the grammar. So, I think the tokens are like S \u2192 something generating the string.\n\nSo, to determine whether the string is generated by the grammar, I can try to parse it step by step, substituting each NT with their possible productions until I reach the start symbol.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse tree starting from the string and working backwards to the root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to see if each token in the string can be derived from some NT.\n\nBut perhaps breaking down the string into parts and seeing if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me start:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language this grammar defines. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. This form is useful because it simplifies the parsing process and makes certain properties easier to analyze.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the production rules on the left side (like S, NT47, etc.) produce either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21 means the start symbol S directly produces two non-terminals. NT29 produces another pair, and so on, until the lowest level where some non-terminals produce terminal symbols, like NT59 \u2192 t48.\n\nThe string provided is: `t48 t71 t80 t56 t2 t93 t33 t13 t2 t33 t91 t35 t2 t87 t20 t11 t33 t13 t90 t30 t50 t2 t15 t2 t56 t2 t30 t71 t11 t49 t11 t33 t2 t48 t48 t16 t2 t15 t60 t63`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. That means every symbol in the string (which are all terminals) should be matched by the productions in the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and following the production rules until all terminals are consumed.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll try to parse the string using the grammar, step by step. Since it's a context-free grammar, I'll use a top-down approach, starting from S and expanding non-terminals until I reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the grammar and see if I can match the beginning of the string with the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar is defined as S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S starts by producing NT29 and NT21. \n\nSo the first part of the string should match the concatenation of the strings generated by NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t48. Let's see what non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT29 \u2192 t48. So NT29 directly produces t48, which matches the first token.\n\nNext, after t48 comes t71, which should be generated by NT21. Let's check the production for NT21: from the given rules, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72. Wait, but the second part after t48 in the production of S is NT21. So after NT29 \u2192 t48, we need NT21 to produce t71.\n\nBut wait, according to the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72. So for NT21 to produce t71, we need to expand further.\n\nLooking at the string after t48 comes t71. So the second symbol is t71, which should come from NT21.\n\nLet me parse NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72. So NT21 expands into NT20 and NT72. Now, let's see what NT20 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. So NT20 expands to NT2 and NT55. \n\nLooking at the string, after t48 (NT29) and t71 (which is the first part of NT21's expansion), the next tokens are t80, t56, t2, t93, etc. But wait, this might not align correctly. Let me try to break it down more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build the parse tree starting from S and see if it can match the string step by step.\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nSo the string starts with NT29 producing t48, and then NT21 needs to produce the rest, which starts with t71.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72. So NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, and NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after t48 (NT29's t48) comes t71, which is supposed to come from NT72? Or perhaps NT72 is part of NT21's expansion.\n\nWait, let me correct this. Since NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72, the string after t71 (from NT21) needs to consume the next part of NT20 and NT72.\n\nBut NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, so after t71, we have t80, which should come from NT20. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55. NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60, and NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, and so on.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for possible matches in the grammar for each terminal in the string, moving from left to right, checking if the grammar can generate that sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each step of the grammar can produce the subsequent part of the string.\n\nLet me try to step through the string carefully.\n\nString: [t48, t71, t80, t56, t2, t93, t33, t13, t2, t33, t91, t35, t2, t87, t20, t11, t33, t13, t90, t30, t50, t2, t15, t2, t56, p2, t30, t71, t11, t49, t11, t33, t2, t48, t48, t16, t2, t15, t60, t63].\n\nFirst token: t48.\n\nLooking at NT29 \u2192 t48, so the first non-terminal is NT29, which produces t48.\n\nSo the first part of the string is matched by NT29, leaving the string starting from t71 onwards.\n\nNow, the next non-terminal after NT29 is NT21. So NT21 needs to generate the remaining part of the string starting at t71.\n\nSo, let's look at NS21 \u2192 NT20 NT72.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55.\n\nSo NT21 expands to NT20 and NT72.\n\nNow, the string after t48 is t71, which should come from NT72. But wait, is that correct? Wait, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72, so the production is a concatenation of NT20 and NT72. So the next part of the string should be generated by NT20 followed by NT72.\n\nWait, but after NT21 comes NT20 and NT72. So the string after t48 is t71, then t80, etc. But perhaps t71 is part of NT72's production.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach it more systematically.\n\nThe entire string must be generated by a series of productions, starting from S. Each step replaces a non-terminal with its productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, the initial step:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNow, NT29 \u2192 t48, so that's the first symbol of the string.\n\nThen, NT21 \u2192 NT20 NT72.\n\nSo now, the string becomes: t48, (NT20 NT72), which is then expanded.\n\nSo, the next symbols will be generated by NT20 and NT72.\n\nBut the string after t48 is t71, which suggests that the first symbol produced by NT20 and NT72 is t71. But looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, which are non-terminals, and NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nWait, that's not reaching t71 directly. So perhaps I'm making a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe after NT21 expands to NT20 NT72, the NT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55, and then NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something about how the parsing works.

{"custom_id":"request-739","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits that structure, with all productions being either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t23 t11 t49 t20 t2 t56 t2 t93 t15 t91 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t93 t33 t56 t30 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t30 t11 t49 t80 t11 t15 t13 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t63`.\n\nWow, that's quite a long string. I need to see if it can be generated by the given grammar. Maybe I should start by listing out all the non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals seem to be all the NT followed by numbers, like NT2, NT4, etc. The terminals here are things like 't48', 't23', etc., which are all the 't' followed by numbers, except in the grammar's productions, I see some terminals like 't97', 't50', etc.\n\nNow, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. To check if the string is generated, I might need to follow the parse tree from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the first production, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S is replaced by NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29: in the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for NT29. Wait, let's check the given grammar again. Oh, actually, looking through the productions, NT29 is present in two places: once as NT29 -> NT0 NT58, and another as NT24 \u2192 NT38 NT72, which might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, does the grammar have a production for NT29? Let me double-check: looking through all the productions, I see NT59 -> NT0 NT58, but nothing for NT29. So maybe NT29 is not a non-terminal? Or perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let's go through the grammar step by step:\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21. So NT29 and NT21 are part of the initial split.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT29 is mentioned here: NT59 -> NT0 NT58. So maybe NT29 is part of another production, or perhaps it was a typo. Wait, no, the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the string must derive from this.\n\nBut looking through the rest, I don't see any production for NT29 except in the case of NT59. So maybe NT29 is a terminal? But in the grammar, NT29 is on the right-hand side, so it must be a non-terminal. But I don't see a production that defines NT29, so that's confusing. Perhaps NT29 is supposed to be a terminal? Or maybe I missed it in the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the only place NT29 appears is in NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, no, that's NT59. So perhaps NT29 is not present, so maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, but NT29 isn't a non-terminal. That can't be, because in CNF, all left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and right-hand sides are two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again. The first line is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So S is replaced by NT29 and NT21. Now, looking for NT29 in the rest of the grammar. I see NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which is NT59, not NT29. So maybe the grammar is a bit off, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT29 is actually NT59? Or maybe there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe NT29 is derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assume that the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and both NT29 and NT21 can be derived into terminals. So let's see if the string starts with t48, t23, etc.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since this string is very long, and the grammar might have a certain structure, perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nLet me try to break the string into parts that might correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is: t48 t23 t11 t49 t20 t2 t56 t2 t93 t15 t91 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t93 t33 t56 t30 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t30 t11 t49 t80 t11 t15 t13 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t63.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t48. Looking in the grammar, I see that NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72, and looking for terminals that are t followed by a number. Wait, in the grammar, some of the endpoints are terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58 (non-terminals)\n- NT23 -> NT11 NT49 (non-terminals)\n- NT11 -> NT49 NT58 (non-terminals)\n- NT49 is a terminal: NT49 -> 't93'\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28 (non-terminals)\n- NT52 is a terminal: NT52 -> 't63'\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72 (non-terminals)\n- NT37 is a terminal: NT37 -> 't2'\n- NT72 is a terminal: NT72 -> 't56'\n\nSo the production NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72 can expand to t2 t56.\n\nLooking at the start: the string has t48 t23. Looking for productions that start with terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string and see if it can be divided into the productions.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe string starts with t48 t23 t11 t49 t20 t2 t56 t2 t93 t15 t91 t90 t30 t90 t30 t2 t93 t33 t56 t30 t56 t2 t2 t2 t15 t30 t11 t49 t80 t11 t15 t13 t2 t23 t93 t49 t20 t2 t33 t60 t63.\n\nFirst, t48 appears in NT24, where NT24 is a terminal? Wait, let me check all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals are: 't48', 't23', 't11', 't49', 't20', 't2', 't56', 't93', 't15', 't91', 't90', 't30', 't56', 't2', 't71', 't19', 't90', 't30', 't41', 't19', 't13', etc.\n\nSo the terminals are all the 't' followed by a number. So they can be directly matched.\n\nNow, let's try to parse the string from left to right, using the grammar.\n\nThe first terminal is t48.\n\nLooking through the productions, which terminal matches t48? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT19 -> 't15'\n\nNT59 -> 't93'\n\nNT46 -> 't51'\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the terminals:\n\n- t48: does any non-terminal expand to 't48'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't60', so no. Wait, I think I need to list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT59 -> 't93' \u2192 produces 't93'\n\nNT24 \u2192 '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I know that in CNF, each production is either a terminal or exactly two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, yes, all the rules on the left side are like that. For example, S -> NT29 NT21, which means S is broken down into two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. Each of those non-terminals also eventually lead to more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string `t48 t56 t2 t93 t63 t2 t11 t15 t71 t93 t49 t93 t15 t30 t56 t2 t2 t15 t11 t33 t24 t20 t60 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t93 t20 t2 t11 t33 t48 t63` can be generated by expanding the start symbol S to the entire string using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the grammar and the string step by step. Maybe I'll try to parse the string from left to right, assigning the non-terminals based on the grammar rules. But since this might get complicated, I can look at the grammar rules and see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me list the productions for each non-terminal to see if they can generate certain terminals:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT21\n- NT26: Maybe generates 't2', 't18', etc.\n- NT29: Could generate 't48'\n- NT56: Leads to 't56' (if NT56 is a terminal). Wait, looking at the productions, NT15 -> NT71 NT68, and NT68 might produce 't30'. Hmm, maybe NT56 is a non-terminal that can generate a terminal, but looking at the rules, NT56 isn't directly on the left side. Wait, actually, the rules provided include some non-terminals mapping to terminals, like NT52 -> 't63', NT19 -> 't15', etc. So each non-terminal either eventually leads to a terminal or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar is in CNF, so every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So some of these non-terminals on the left side become terminals, others become two non-terminals. So I can probably map each non-terminal to its possible terminals and then see how the string can be constructed.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT1 -> 't73'\n- NT70 -> 't51' and 't36'\n- NT50 -> 't71' and 't24'\n- NT5 -> 't93' and 't64'\n- NT59 -> varies, some to 't0', 't58', 't34', etc.\n- NT34 -> 't48' and 't60'\n- NT20 -> 't18' and 't72'\n- NT24 -> 't24' (terminal) and perhaps other rules, like NT26 -> 't13' via NT24?\n\nWait, no. NT24 -> 't24' and another non-terminal, but looking at the rules, NT24 is on the left side of another production: NT24 -> NT10 NT57. So NT24 itself is a non-terminal that can produce two non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps some non-terminals have rules that can produce a terminal and another non-terminal, even though in CNF each is either terminal or two non-terminals. So, for example, NT24 can produce 't24' directly, or it can produce 't10' and 't13' because NT10 might produce 't10' or something else.\n\nWait, actually, no. In CNF, each production is either terminal or two non-terminals. So if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, that's one production, and then other productions that break it down into two non-terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals have rules that include a terminal and another non-terminal. For example, NT19 -> 't15' as a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-751","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but it's a bit intimidating because the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and rules. Let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to one non-terminal or a terminal. Wait, no, actually CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, it seems most rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTzw NTab, which fit the A \u2192 BC pattern. So, we don't have any rules with more than two non-terminals, which is good.\n\nMy task is to see if the provided string can be derived from the start symbol S using these productions. The string is a sequence of terminals (letters like t48, t71, etc.), so I don't have to worry about the structure beyond matching these terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the beginning, applying the rules in reverse (since parsing top-down with the given rules might be complex). But wait, since the grammar is in CNF, I can try using a recursive descent parser approach or maybe even parse each symbol step by step, ensuring that each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and terminals first. Terminals are the ones that appear in the right-hand sides as single symbols like t48, t71, etc. Non-terminals are all the others starting with NT. So, symbols like NT29, NT21, etc., are non-terminals, and others like t48 and t71 are terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, produces NT29 NT21. So, the first two symbols of the string must be generated from NT29 and NT21. Let me look at the string:\n\nThe string starts with t48 t71 t93 t49 t93 t15 t2 t93 t33 t13 ...\n\nSo, maybe S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which would produce a string starting with t48 (if NT29 \u2192 t48) and then t71 (if NT21 \u2192 t71). Looking at the string, that could be possible because the first terminal is t48.\n\nBut wait, the given string starts with t48, but according to the grammar, NT29 \u2192 t48. So, NT29 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait no, that's not correct. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT29 has some rules, like NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, but also a rule where NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT13 is transformed into NT26 -> 't13'. Wait, no. Wait, the rule is NT26 -> 't13'. So, in that case, NT26 is a non-terminal, but one of its productions is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the initial rules, some non-terminals have productions that are single terminals. For example, NT26 \u2192 't13', which means that when NT26 is expanded, it can derive the terminal t13.\n\nBut in the given string, I see terms like t48, t71, etc. So I need to check if each terminal in the string is allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree bottom-up, starting from the string and trying to match the productions.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if there's a sequence of productions that can generate it.\n\nLet me list some key rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\nNT29 \u2192 t48 or other rules (like NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58)\n\nWait, the top-level rule is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first step is to replace S with NT29 NT21, which corresponds to the first two parts of the string.\n\nSo the string starts with t48 and then t71. Let's see if that's consistent with N29 and N21.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT29 has a production rule: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58 (I think that's one of its rules). Also, NT29 can go to 't48'. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I have to scan through all rules.\n\nHmm, I see a rule: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which is a production of two non-terminals. But another rule where NT29 ... I don't see a direct t48 production, because looking through the rules, the lines like NT26 -> 't13' are productions where the non-terminal goes to a terminal. So maybe NT29 doesn't have a direct production to t48, but NT26 does. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT26 has a rule NT26 -> 't13', and another rule NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT72. So NT26 can be a terminal or split into two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t48. So, which non-terminal can derive t48? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't93' (from NT0 -> 't93')\n\nNT55 -> NT10 NT34, etc. Wait, let me find t48.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT59 -> 't48' is one of the rules, because I see \"NT59 -> NT0 NT58\" and \"NT59 -> NT10 NT26\", but further down I see \"NT34 -> 't48'\". Also, looking for each production's right-hand side, there's \"NT47 -> 't51'\", \"NT33 -> 't23'\", etc. Wait, no, wait: the rules are listed, and some are like NT59 -> 't48'? Let me scan.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT70 NT47\n\nWait, looking through all the production rules, I see:\n\nLet me go through all the rules line by line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to see how many tokens it has. Counting them, there are 52 tokens. Since each production either produces one terminal or two non-terminals, the number of non-terminals at each step either stays the same or increases by one. So, the total number of production steps needed should be related to the length of the string.\n\nBut counting tokens isn't enough. I need to build the derivation tree step by step. The given grammar is quite extensive, so I'll start by looking for the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the production rules for S, it's S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the left-hand side (LHS) is S, and the right-hand side (RHS) is two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21. That means the string must start with the symbols derived from NT29 followed by those from NT21.\n\nLet me check the start of the string: \"t48 t56 t2...\" Hmm, NT29 and NT21 are likely to produce these. Looking up NT29 in the production rules, I see NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34. And NT59 has multiple productions, including NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58, which can be further broken down, eventually leading to terminals. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, I think the string might start with NT29 producing t48 and t56? Looking at NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34. NT59 can become NT0 NT58, and NT0 is 't93', a terminal. NT58 is NT24 NT20. Wait, no, let me check: NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28, which are non-terminals. So NT24 and NT20 are involved. Oh, looking back, NT24 has a production \u2192 NT72 NT45? Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nLet me try to find a way to break down the string. Maybe I can use the fact that each production adds either no symbols or two. The string length is 52, so the number of symbols in the derivation would be 2*number of productions +1. Wait, that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each production step as each non-terminal can be replaced, so the total number of nodes in the parse tree should be 52, but I'm not sure about the exact count.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each production can either produce a terminal or two non-terminals. So, starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, each step could consume either one or two tokens. So, for a string of 52 tokens, the number of production steps would be such that 2^k \u2248 52. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think in terms of the grammar's expansion depth. Each non-terminal can produce terminals or non-terminals, so the number of tokens increases when non-terminals are expanded into more non-terminals. So, the string is built by replacing non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nBut manually expanding the entire string might take too long. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if certain parts of the string correspond to known production paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t48, t56, t2, t2, etc. Let's see: t48 is a terminal symbol. Looking through the production rules, t48 appears in multiple places, like NT58 \u2192 't48', NT24 \u2192 't24', but I'm looking for a terminal called 't48'. Hmm, actually, 't48' is a terminal symbol, so it's directly produced by some production.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT58 \u2192 NT24 NT20, but 20 is an NT. But elsewhere, I see NT24 has productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT58's productions: NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nWait, that's not helping. Maybe I should look for terminals in the non-terminals. So, 't48' is a terminal, so it's derived somewhere directly.\n\nLooking at NT58, I see NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. But 52 is an NT, and 28 is another NT. So, maybe NT52 and NT28 are both expanded into terminals?\n\nLooking at NT52, its productions are:\n- NT52 \u2192 't63'\n- NT52 \u2192 NT1 NT26.\n\nAh! So NT52 can directly produce 't63' or NT1 followed by NT26.\n\nIf the string starts with 't48', maybe the first expansion is NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't48', so maybe 't48' is derived from a non-terminal. So, perhaps 't48' is produced by NT58, which is part of NT29's expansion.\n\nWait, NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34. And NT59 has several productions, like NT59 \u2192 NT58 NT51, and NT58 \u2192 NT24 NT20, and NT24 \u2192 NT72 NT45? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, but I don't see it producing 't24' directly. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the rules.\n\nLet me go back. The string starts with 't48 t56 t2 t2...'.\n\nLet's consider S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT59 NT34. NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58.\n\nSo, NT0 is 't93', a terminal, and NT58 \u2192 NT24 NT20.\n\nNow, NT24 can produce 't24' (if it has that terminal directly). Looking through the rules, I see NT24 has several productions, but I don't see 't24' as a terminal, instead, it's a non-terminal that eventually leads to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe NT34 is a non-terminal. Let's track NT34.\n\nNT34 has:\n- NT34 \u2192 't60'\n- NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55\n- NT34 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n\nSo 't60' is directly a terminal.\n\nWait, so starting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which becomes NT59 NT34.\n\nNT59 branches into NT0 (t93) and NT58 (which branches into NT24 and NT20). Then, NT24 \u2192 ... I'm getting lost here. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the entire parse tree is too cumbersome, so maybe I can check if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking for the substring 't48 t56' ... 't48' and 't56'\u2014do these appear anywhere as parts of productions?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that NT46 \u2192 NT39 NT59 and others, but I don't see 't48' directly. Wait, 't48' is a terminal, so probably derived from NT58 \u2192 't48'.\n\nWait, looking for where 't48' is. I see NT58 \u2192 't48' and NT20 \u2192 't18', but I don't see 't48' until I check the NT58 production.\n\nWait, actually, 't48' seems to appear in the production rules as NT58 \u2192 't48' and NT51 \u2192 't87' is in another place. Hmm.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step. The string starts with t48, t56, t2, t2, t90, t30, etc.\n\nWait, 't56' is a token that appears in NT21, which is part of S's production.\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I should count the number of symbols and see if it aligns with the number of productions.\n\nWait, the number of non-terminals is high, but each production either adds a terminal or keeps it the same. So, the maximum number of terminals is the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nGiven that the string is 52 tokens, perhaps the number of production steps can account for this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for sequences of terminals that can only be derived from specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example, 't2' occurs multiple times. Looking through the production rules, 't2' is produced by NT71?

{"custom_id":"request-773","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the rules, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with NT29 and NT21. Wait, but looking at the string, it starts with 't48 t93 ...', so I need to see which NT29 and NT21 correspond to these tokens.\n\nLet me look at the NT29 production: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. The terminal for NT0 is 't93' and for NT58, according to the rules, NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT2. Wait, no, looking at the NT58 production: NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT2, but in the rules, it's actually NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28, right? Let me check: Oh no, I see in the rules, NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. Then NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at the terminals for each NT. Let me list them out from the given rules:\n\nNT0: 't93'\nNT1: 't73'\nNT2: 't5'\nNT3: not listed, but wait, looking at the rules, NT3 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, in the rules, NT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34, but I don't see NT3 itself being defined. So perhaps NT3 isn't present, or maybe it's a typo. Let me cross-check: Oh, the rule for NT38 is correct, and the terminal for NT38 is 't35' because NT38 \u2192 't35'. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm seeing that some NTs have multiple productions. My plan is to build a parse tree step by step, starting from S, and see if I can derive the given string by expanding each non-terminal and checking if the terminals match the string tokens in order.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two non-terminals are NT29 and NT21. Let's find their productions.\n\nNT29 has the production: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. The terminal for NT0 is 't93' and for NT58, it's NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. Then, each of these needs to be broken down.\n\nWait, this seems too nested. Maybe it's better to approach it differently. Let me list all NTs and their terminal tokens:\n\n- NT0: t93\n- NT1: t73\n- NT2: t5\n- NT5: t93 (same as NT0, but I think each NT is unique)\n- NT5: t11 (from NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, and NT72 \u2192 t56, NT64 \u2192 t34 and so on. Wait, but looking at the rule for NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, and each of these has their own productions.)\n\nActually, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should use a top-down approach, applying the productions step by step and seeing if I can match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the possible strings each NT can produce and see if any of them can match the given string.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I should look for the start symbols and see if the string can be matched.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT29 NT21, and the string starts with t48, which is NT29? Wait, let me confirm the NT29 production: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. The terminal for NT0 is t93, so the string starts with t93, but the given string starts with t48. That would mean that the first part of the string cannot be derived from S. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NTs. Maybe S is the start symbol, and the productions produce sequences of terminals. So S \u2192 NT29 NT21 must produce a string that starts with t48 followed by something else.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. NT0 is 't93' and NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28. So the initial part would be t93 followed by whatever NT58 produces.\n\nBut the string starts with t48, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the start symbol's first production starts with t93, which doesn't match t48.\n\nWait, but let me check if I misread the NT29 terminal. Looking back, NT0 is t93, so NT29's first production is NT0 \u2192 t93, followed by NT58. That would mean the initial part starts with t93, not t48. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made an error in the NT29 production. Looking back at the rules:\n\nLine by line:\n\nS \u2192 NT29 NT21\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nNT37 \u2192 't2'\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37 \u2192 NT56 (if NT72's rule is NT56, but looking back, the rule for NT72 is NT65 NT37, and NT65's rules include t56, etc. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each NT might generate a specific terminal string. Let's try to see possible outputs for each NT.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nNT37 \u2192 't2'\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT65 \u2192 't56' (from NT65 \u2192 NT56, and NT56 is a terminal 't56'?)\nWait, looking at the rules, NT65 \u2192 NT56. But there's a rule NT65 \u2192 t56, because I see in the rules that NT65 is replaced by 't56'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see lines like NT65 \u2192 t56? Let me check:\n\nNo, looking through, I don't see an explicit terminal for NT65. Let's see:\n\nWait, the rules are numerous. Let me search for NT65. Yes, I see:\n\nNT65 \u2192 NT56\nNT56 \u2192 t71\nSo NT65 produces 't71'.\n\nSimilarly, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, which would be t71 followed by t2.\n\nSo, following NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37 \u2192 t71 t2.\n\nSo, going back, NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72 \u2192 t2 t71 t2.\n\nWait, but the NT28 production is actually NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72. Wait, but in the rules, it's actually NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72. So that would expand to t2 t71 t2.\n\nBut NT28 \u2192 t2, so no\u2014wait, no, NT28 is a terminal if it's on the left-hand side. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT28 is on the left, but the production for NT28 is as follows: I think I need to list each NT and their production rules correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of each NT and its possible productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60\n- NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT65 \u2192 t56\n- NT37 \u2192 t2\n\nSo NT72 \u2192 t56 NT37, but wait, the production for NT72 is NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37. But NT65 \u2192 t56, so in total, NT72 \u2192 t56 t2.\n\nWait, no, because NT37 is a terminal: t2.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, and NT65 \u2192 t56, and NT37 \u2192 t2. So NT72 becomes t56 t2.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72 \u2192 t2 t56 t2.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused again.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which might produce a terminal directly. That should make parsing easier, I think, because I can handle each production as non-terminal expanding into two others, possibly terminals.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of non-terminals like S, NT29, NT47, etc. Each of these rules produces two other non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, actually, every production is in the form NTx -> NTy NTz, right? Because even the terminals in the grammar's productions seem to be 't' followed by numbers, like 't97', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT5 -> NT72 NT64, and NT24 -> 't24', which is a terminal. So some production rules may directly produce a terminal. Hmm, but in CNF, typically, each production has two non-terminals, but I guess in this case, some productions have terminals. Maybe the grammar is slightly different, perhaps mixed with some productions that introduce terminals.\n\nBut in any case, the string I'm given is a sequence of these terminals, each like 't48', 't73', etc. My task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo first, I should look at the string and see its length. Let's count How many tokens are there.\n\nLooking at the string: `t48 t73 t50 t2 t24 t80 t93 t97 t2 t90 t30 t56 t2 t93 t33 t48 t63 t24 t93 t33 t30 t11 t49 t93 t33 t48 t63 t91 t50 t2 t48 t60 t16 t2 t15 t72 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t60 t97`.\n\nLet me split it into individual tokens: \n\n1. t48\n2. t73\n3. t50\n4. t2\n5. t24\n6. t80\n7. t93\n8. t97\n9. t2\n10. t90\n11. t30\n12. t56\n13. t2\n14. t93\n15. t33\n16. t48\n17. t63\n18. t24\n19. t93\n20. t33\n21. t30\n22. t11\n23. t49\n24. t93\n25. t33\n26. t48\n27. t63\n28. t91\n29. t50\n30. t2\n31. t48\n32. t60\n33. t16\n34. t2\n35. t15\n36. t72\n37. t49\n38. t50\n39. t2\n40. t11\n41. t15\n42. t60\n43. t97\n\nSo there are 43 tokens in the string. \n\nNow, how does the parsing process work here? Since the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces a non-terminal into two others (which may be terminals or non-terminals). So the parse tree would be a binary tree, and the string would be the sequence of terminal symbols generated at the leaves.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S -> NT29 NT21, so the root of the parse tree is S, which expands into two non-terminals: NT29 and NT21.\n\nEach of these NTs will then expand further until all leaves are terminals.\n\nI think a possible approach is to simulate the parsing process, keeping track of which non-terminals can produce which terminals. Or perhaps to use a recursive descent approach, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a context-free grammar and try to see if the string can be generated by deriving from S.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to look at the start symbol S and see what rules apply, then see if we can match the string step by step.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, that might be too time-consuming manually. Maybe looking for patterns or terminals that directly appear in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's look at the given grammar again. For example, NT5 is 't93'. Similarly, NT13 is 't50', NT24 is 't24', NT37 is 't2', etc. So each of these NTs either produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach here is to model this as a parser and see if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct an abstract context-free grammar, considering the terminal symbols and the non-terminals, and see if the string can be built using the production rules.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can represent the string and see if each production rule corresponds to breaking it down into smaller parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S: S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the first two symbols must come from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29 in the grammar: NT29 -> NT48 NT97? Wait, no, looking back, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that the grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\nNT47 -> NT59 NT15\nNT26 -> NT24 NT72\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\nNT64 -> NT59 NT37\nNT65 -> NT15 NT65\nNT46 -> NT39 NT59\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\nNT34 -> NT64 NT55\n... and so on.\n\nWait, let's check the rule for NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at the rules provided, I don't see an explicit rule for NT29 or NT21. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if we start with S -> NT29 NT21, but in the grammar, NT29 and NT21 don't have production rules defined, it means they can only produce a single terminal. Wait, but in the given rules, only a few NTs have production rules, others are missing. Wait no, the given rules are all the production rules, I think. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, NT29 is defined because in the rules, I see: NT29 -> NT24 NT48. Oh wait, no, looking again, are there any rules for NT29 or NT21?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I have to look for NT29. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT29: I don't see a production rule for NT29. Hmm, looking closely, the rules: let me scan the list.\n\nEach production is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> 't...'. So for example, NT26 -> NT24 NT72. Similarly, other NTs have production definitions.\n\nWait, looking through the rules: \n\nI see:\n\nNT29 -> something? Wait, let me scan through:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT21\n\nWait, that's the first rule. But NT29 isn't defined further. So does that mean that the production for NT29 is undefined? Or perhaps in the grammar, NT29 is replaced by something else? Hmm, but the initial rule is S -> NT29 NT21, meaning that NT29 and NT21 must be replaced according to their own production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each NT29 and NT21. If they aren't defined, it's possible that they only produce a single terminal, but in Chomsky normal form, each production has two symbols on the right. Wait, no, in CNF, each production must be either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, the productions must be:\n\nA \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, all the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTw. So all the non-terminals are left-hand side of productions that expand into two non-terminals.\n\nThat's a key point. So none of the non-terminals in the grammar produce a terminal directly. They all have two non-terminals as their production.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or there are no other forms. Looking at the grammar, most of the productions seem to be of the form NT followed by two other NTs, like S \u2192 NT29 NT21. That fits the CNF where each production has two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of tokens that start with 't48' and end with 't73'. I think each token corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I should list out the productions and terminals for clarity:\n\nTerminals are any token that doesn't have a \u2192 in any production. From the grammar, I see that many of the NTs produce terminals like 't50', 't97', etc. So the string consists of these t tokens.\n\nI recall that for CNF grammars, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but maybe I can do a simpler approach since the string is given. Another method is to check if the string can be split into a series of derivations that match the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build the parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each step of the derivation will involve replacing a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to look at the structure of the string and see if it can be generated by the derivation rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string:\n\nt48 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t15 t91 t48 t60 t16 t2 t93 t15 t30 t11 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t91 t11 t49 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t2 t2 t23 t16 t2 t33 t60 t63.\n\nI think each of these t tokens is a terminal derived from one of the NTs. So I should find the corresponding NT for each token. For example, 't48' is produced by NT24 according to the grammar (looking up in the productions), which is: NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57; NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19; and so on. But wait, maybe it's more efficient to see if the sequence can be built by applying the productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the structure of the string can be broken into parts that fit the grammar's rules. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two others, so the string should have a binary tree structure where each non-terminal is expanded into two parts.\n\nAlternatively, the string's length is 45 tokens. Each production adds one token, so starting from the start symbol S, which is NT29 NT21, each expansion doubles the number of symbols, but since the string is given as a linear sequence, perhaps we can check if the string can be parsed by recursively splitting it into parts derived from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the start symbol's productions and see if any of them can generate parts of the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string should start with something that produces NT29 and then something that produces NT21. Looking at the string, it starts with t48 (which is NT24), but wait, S starts with NT29. Hmm, that might be a problem because the first part of the string is t48, which is from NT24, not NT29. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is NT29 and NT21. So the first two symbols in the string should be generated by NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first token is t48 which is NT24? Because in the productions, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, and then NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19, etc. Wait, but the start is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first symbol should be the expansion of NT29, which from the grammar is: NT29 \u2192 NT24 NT56 (from the production NT24 \u2192 NT91 NT56? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT29 is produced by NT24 NT55 (from NT24 \u2192 NT91 NT55). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for NT29 in the productions. Oh, I see NT29 in this production: NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38 and NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT55. Hmm, I don't see NT29 directly. Wait, actually, in the productions provided, NT29 is used in the expansion of NT26: once as NT24 NT55, which becomes t48 (NT24 is t48, NT55 is 't11'). Wait, maybe I should make a mapping of each NT to its terminals.\n\nLet me list each NT and the terminals they produce:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 t58 (from NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 t93 t58? Wait, no. Wait, some NTs produce terminals:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 but NT0 is t93, and NT58 is some NT. Wait, no, wait. Some productions are of the form NTx \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think the terminals are any that appear on the right side without being split into NTs. So NT51 \u2192 't87', NT33 \u2192 't23', NT19 \u2192 't15', etc.\n\nLet me list all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nNT51 \u2192 t87\n\nNT33 \u2192 t23\n\nNT19 \u2192 t15\n\nNT68 \u2192 t30\n\nNT47 \u2192 t51\n\nNT1 \u2192 t73\n\nNT73 \u2192 t56 (Wait, no. Let me check each production line.\n\nEach line starts with NTx and then has either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t18: So NT20 \u2192 t18.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 t91.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t24.\n\nWait, for all NTs that have a production ending with a terminal, I can map each NT to the terminals it directly produces.\n\nAlternatively, for the given string, each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t48 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t15 t91 t48 t60 t16 t2 t93 t15 t30 t11 t49 t80 t93 t20 t2 t2 t91 t11 t49 t56 t2 t73 t50 t2 t15 t2 t2 t23 t16 t2 t33 t60 t63.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So the first token is t48, which must be the result of expanding some NT.\n\nLooking for which NTs produce t48. Scanning the productions:\n\nLooking through the NTs' productions:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n\nIs there a production for NT24 that leads to t48? Wait, in the productions, NT29 and NT24 may produce t48? Let me check each NT:\n\nWait, NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT21 (from NT29 \u2192 NT26 NT21). Then NT26 has several productions, one of which is NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT55. So NT29 expands to NT26 (which is t48) and NT21.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t48, which would correspond to NT24 \u2192 t48, but looking at NT24's productions, I don't see a direct terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs and their direct productions (terminals):\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58 \u2192 No, because NT0 is 't93' and NT58 is something else? Wait, maybe I'm looking wrong. Let me check each production line.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify which productions produce terminals. Let's look through each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT29 NT21\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-812","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token might be a terminal or a non-terminal. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is useful because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side or terminals on the right. Wait, no, actually in CNF, it's either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar and the string to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is quite long, so it's going to be a bit time-consuming, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT29 NT21. So the first step would be that S generates two non-terminals, NT29 and NT21. Then each of those can be replaced according to their respective production rules. The string we're given starts with 't48 t93 t15 t60 t63 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t50 t2 t93 t33 t30 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t49 t80 t48 t48 t16 t2 t93 t33 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t60 t97 t24 t50 t2 t15 t48 t63'.\n\nI notice that some tokens in the string are repeated, such as 't48', 't93', etc. Also, some of these are terminals, so they must be part of the expansion path.\n\nLet me start by looking for the top-level production. S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols in the string after S's expansion must correspond to the production of NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first token is 't48', so we need to see if NT29 can produce 't48', 'something' else, etc. Alternatively, wait, the production for NT29 is listed as NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58. So N29 expands to N0 and N58.\n\nSo, substituting, S becomes N29 N1, with N29 \u2192 N0 N58 and N1 perhaps as another non-terminal. Wait, N21 is another non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, N21's production is N21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So when S \u2192 N29 N21, N29 is converted to N0 and N58, and N21 is converted to N55 and N52. So the string should then be a sequence of derivations from N0, N58, N55, and N52.\n\nBut the string given is a flat list of tokens, so I'm assuming that as the string is parsed, it's a sequence of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) that results from expanding the start symbol S down to terminals and non-terminals until all non-terminals are eliminated (i.e., each non-terminal is replaced by a sequence of terminals and remaining non-terminals that may themselves need to be expanded).\n\nSo the initial step is S \u2192 N29 N21. Then we need to expand N29 to N0 N58 and N21 to N55 N52. So after expanding, the string should have sequences that can derive from those.\n\nLooking at the string's first token is 't48', which could be from N0 or N58 or other. Let's find the production for N0 and N58 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- N0: N0 \u2192 NT59 NT64.\n\n- N58: N58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\nWait, so N0 can produce two non-terminals, and N58 can also produce non-terminals. However, in the string, we might have other terminals appearing.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 N29 N21. So after that, each of N29 and N21 can be further expanded. Let's see what each of these produces:\n\n- N29 \u2192 N0 N58.\n\n- N21 \u2192 N55 N52.\n\nSo the initial expansion leads to N0 N58 N55 N52. Now, each of these can be expanded further:\n\n- N0 \u2192 NT59 NT64.\n\n- N58 \u2192 NT52 NT28.\n\n- N55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\n- N52 \u2192 't2' (wait, no. Looking at the rule definitions, I need to check if N52 has a production rule or is it a terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking for N52: The rule N52 \u2192 't63' because in the grammar, N52 \u2192 't63' (since N52 is a production leading to a terminal).\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT52, I see \"NT52 -> 't63'\". So N52 is a terminal string 't63'. So if N52 is in the expansion, it directly becomes 't63', which would match the string. So in the initial expansion, N21 \u2192 N55 N52, which becomes N55 followed by N52, which is 't63'.\n\nSo now, the string so far after expanding N21 is N0 N58 N55 't63'.\n\nWait, not exactly, because we need to expand each step correctly. Let's approach this more systematically.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t93 t15 t60 t63 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t50 t2 t93 t33 t30 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t49 t80 t48 t48 t16 t2 t93 t33 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t60 t97 t24 t50 t2 t15 t48 t63\n\nBut actually, each step in the expansion produces a sequence of symbols. We can model this with a stack, maybe, or using a parse tree. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, perhaps the direct approach is better.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, from left to right, trying to match the productions.\n\nWait, actually, an alternative approach is to realize that in CNF, the number of symbols in the derivation tree grows exactly like a full binary tree, and the length of the string is n, so there would have been n-1 steps of production. But perhaps that's more than needed.\n\nInstead, let me consider the possible derivations step by step.\n\nLet me start by writing the initial string as a list to make it easier to process.\n\nThe string is:\n\n['t48', 't93', 't15', 't60', 't63', 't11', 't15', 't30', 't93', 't49', 't50', 't2', 't93', 't33', 't30', 't90', 't30', 't2', 't56', 't2', 't2', 't93', 't20', 't2', 't49', 't80', 't48', 't48', 't16', 't2', 't93', 't33', 't93', 't20', 't2', 't93', 't33', 't60', 't97', 't24', 't50', 't2', 't15', 't48', 't63']\n\nEach of these symbols needs to be generated by expanding the non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, let's see if the string can be parsed starting with NT29 and NT21.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the string should start with the leftmost non-terminal. Let me check:\n\n- The first symbol in the string is 't48'. Looking at the grammar, does any rule expand to 't48'?\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, we have several NTs that produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' (since in the rule NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57; wait no, wait, looking back, the production for NT24: \"NT24 -> NT10 NT57\" until I find a rule where"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with what NT29 and NT21 derive into. \n\nLooking at NT29 and NT21 in the grammar rules:\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n\nSo, the string should start with the concatenation of NT0 and NT55, followed by NT58 and NT52. Let's split the string into these parts. The given string starts with `t48 t11 t33 t87 t20 t11 t33 t24 t2 t71 t11 t49 t90 t30 t71 t80 t93 t97 t2 t2 t90 t30 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t33 t2 t2 t90 t30 t50 t2 t93 t33 t48 t63`.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning. Since the first production is S \u2192 NT29 NT21, the string must start with what NT29 and NT21 derivation produces. Let's see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT0 \u2192 't93', so NT29 \u2192 't93' NT58. Now, NT58 \u2192 't20' as per the rule. So NT29 produces 't93 t20'.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. NT55 \u2192 't71' and NT52 \u2192 't63', so NT21 produces 't71 t63'.\n\nPutting it together, S \u2192 NT29 NT21 would produce 't93 t20 t71 t63' as the first four symbols of the string.\n\nBut the string starts with `t48 t11 t33 t87 t20 ...`. That doesn't match the expected 't93 t20 t71 t63'. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. NT29 is split into NT0 and NT58, but when NT0 \u2192 't93' and NT58 \u2192 't20', so NT29 \u2192 't93 t20'. Similarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 \u2192 't71' and NT52 \u2192 't63', so NT21 \u2192 't71 t63'.\n\nSo the initial production should give 't93 t20 t71 t63' as the first four tokens. But the given string starts with 't48 t11 t33 t87 ...', which doesn't match. That suggests that either the string is not generated by the grammar, or there's another path that the grammar might take. But wait, in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals, so the only way to generate a terminal is through these non-terminals eventually deriving into terminals.\n\nSo if the initial production S \u2192 NT29 NT21 is the only way to start, then the string should start with those tokens. Since it starts with something else, perhaps the grammar can't generate this string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me check again. The start symbol is S, which produces NT29 and NT21. So the first four symbols must be what NT29 and NT21 derive into.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and NT0 \u2192 't93', NT58 \u2192 't20'. So that part is fixed.\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, NT55 \u2192 't71', NT52 \u2192 't63'. So that's fixed too.\n\nSo the initial four symbols would be 't93 t20 t71 t63'. But the string starts with 't48 t11 t33 t87 ...', which doesn't match. Therefore, the grammar cannot generate this string because the first symbols don't align with what the initial production can derive.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in how the derivation works. Let me try to see if there's any way the grammar can produce a different starting sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps there's a way to derive terminals other than the ones directly from the initial productions. For example, other non-terminals might derive into other terminals through different paths. Let me check other NT rules.\n\nFor example, NT1 \u2192 't73', but in the provided string, I see 't73' at the end. Let's see if any other NT rules can derive into smaller sequences.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT26 \u2192 't13' (from NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38, but NT24 is another non-terminal. Wait, NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57, and NT10 \u2192 't5 NT19', which might go on. But that might be too deep.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the NT rules can lead to 't48'. Looking through the grammar, 't48' is produced by NT24 \u2192 't48' or NT67 or others. Wait, checking individual rules:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce 't48':\n- NT34 \u2192 't48' (NT34 \u2192 NT64 NT55)\n- NT24 \u2192 't48'? Wait, in the rules I provided, let me check. Looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT24 \u2192 't48'; perhaps I missed one. Let me scan again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with some rules. Looking for the rule that produces 't48':\n\nIn the provided list:\n- NT34 \u2192 't48' (NT24 NT55 \u2192 't48')\n- NT29 \u2192 't48'? No, NT29 derives into NT0 NT58, which is 't93' and 't20'.\n- NT24 \u2192 't91' (from rule NT24 \u2192 NT47 NT59, which is 't10' and 't71'? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, wait.

From the user's grammar:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't91' (from NT24 \u2192 NT47 NT59: NT47 \u2192 't73', NT59 \u2192 't58') Wait, no:\n\nWait, the user's grammar has:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n- NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34\n\nLooking through the rules, some produce terminals:\n\nWait, let's list each NT production and whether it ends in terminal(s):\n\n- NT47 \u2192 't51', 't36' \u2192 't51' and 't36' (since NT68 \u2192 't20'?)\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of NT rules that directly produce terminals and others that go deeper.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\n1. NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58: NT0 is terminal 't93', NT58 is 't20' \u2192 both terminals. So NT29 \u2192 't93 t20'\n2. NT47 \u2192 NT15 NT68: NT15 \u2192 't71' and NT68 is 't30'? Wait, not sure. Need to check each NT rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a tree for the initial symbols.\n\nBut given the initial production S \u2192 NT29 NT21, which must produce 't93 t20' followed by 't71 t63', the start would be 't93 t20 t71 t63'. But the given string starts with 't48 t11 t33 t87', which doesn't match. Therefore, unless there's an alternative starting production, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but in the user's grammar, is S only producing NT29 NT21?

Therefore, the string must start with 't93 t20 t71 t63', but it starts with something else. Therefore, the grammar can't generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a longer derivation where somewhere else in the string has 't48' but the initial derivation is correct.

{"custom_id":"request-830","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens, and each token is either a terminal (like 't48', 't90') or a non-terminal (like NT29, NT47, etc.). \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a set of rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals, or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. No rules with more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol can have a rule that results in a single terminal, but in this case, since we're dealing with a string that starts with 't48', which is a terminal, the production must start with a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all non-terminals are defined in terms of other non-terminals. Each production is either of the form NTa -> NTb NTc or NTa -> 'tX', where 'tX' is a terminal string. So, our string must be built by recursively expanding non-terminals until we end up with all terminals in the correct order.\n\nThe string I'm given is: \nt48 t90 t30 t2 t2 t11 t15 t71 t56 t2 t23 t16 t2 t49 t93 t15 t30 t90 t30 t48 t11 t15 t13 t2 t11 t15 t60 t93 t49 t20 t2 t24 t11 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t33 t60 t97.\n\nThat's quite a long string, 44 tokens. To verify, I need to find a derivation path starting from S and expanding non-terminals step by step, ending up with this string.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S -> NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols must come from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT29, I see the production NT29 -> NT0 NT58. So the first symbol comes from NT0, and the next from NT58. Then, NT0 is produced as 't93' (from NT0 -> 't93'), and NT58 is produced as 't20' (from NT58 -> 't20'). So the first part of the string would be t93 t20. But wait, the given string starts with t48. That's a problem because my first rule expansion gives 't93 t20', but the string starts with 't48'. So that means S can't derive into that string because the first two symbols don't match the expected t93 and t20.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misapplying the grammar. Let me double-check the productions:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNT29 production: NT29 -> NT0 NT58.\n\nNT0 -> 't93'.\n\nSo the first token should be t93, but the given string starts with t48. Therefore, the string 't48 ...' cannot be derived from S in this grammar.\n\nBut maybe I missed something. Let me check the NT29 production again. Is there another production for NT29? Looking at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the top-level productions, I see:\n\nNT29 -> NT48? Wait, no, let me scan through all NT productions to confirm.\n\nWait, the top-level is S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nThen, looking for NT29,\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT29: The first one is NT29 -> NT48 NT97? Wait, actually, looking at all the grammar rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT29 -> ... Looking at the provided grammar, I don't see an NT29 production except perhaps for some rules.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\n- NT29 is produced in NT24, for example, NT24 -> NT10 NT57.\n\nWait, I'm going through all the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for NT29: Hmm, I don't see an NT29 production listed. Oh wait, wait. Let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT29 appears in NT29 -> NT48 NT97? Wait, I don't see that. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nLooking for NT29, it's only in NT29? Hmm, not seeing it in the list provided, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, I think I see it in the first rule:\n\nWait, S -> NT29 NT21. Then, checking all NT productions, does NT29 appear more than once?\n\nWait, I see NT29 in the production when looking at other NT rules. Wait, here's NT24: NT24 -> NT10 NT57, and so on.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, when looking for NT29, is there an NT29 production?\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, for example:\n\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n\n- NT58 -> NT52 NT28\n\nWait, no, I don't see NT29 as a starting symbol in the left-hand side of any production. So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe S isn't the one starting the derivation, or perhaps I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, no, the grammar is given with S as the start symbol. So S is the beginning.\n\nBut since S doesn't produce any terminals except through the NT29 and NT21, and NT29 is undefined in the grammar? Wait, let me check the grammar list again.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me ensure that the productions all correctly follow CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the NTs are produced by others. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nLooking at the other NT rules, let me see if any NT29 or NT21 have productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT21 is produced as NT21 -> NT55 NT52.\n\nLooking for NT29, I don't see any production. Maybe the list was incomplete, or I overlooked it. Alternatively, perhaps I can retrace the productions.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a step-by-step analysis.\n\nFirst, the initial step is S -> NT29 NT21.\n\nNow, to produce the string, we need NT29 to derive a sequence of terminals, and NT21 to derive another sequence, concatenated together.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't48', let's see if either NT29 or NT21 can produce 't48'.\n\nLooking at NT29: If there's a production for NT29 that leads to 't48', but in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT29 on the left side of a production. Therefore, NT29 must be derived through other non-terminals.\n\nLooking into the grammar, perhaps NT29 is a result of expanding a chain of other non-terminals. For example, if NT29 is derived from NT24, which in turn is derived from others, etc., until it reaches a terminal.\n\nLet me check the production of NT24: NT24 -> NT10 NT57.\n\nNT10 -> NT5 NT19.\n\nThen, NT5 -> 't93'.\n\nSo, the path would be NT24 -> NT10 NT57.\n\nNT10 -> 't93' (from NT5), NT57 is something else.\n\nBut since the string starts with 't48', which is 't48', so let's see if any NS can produce 't48' as a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the terminals, I see several NT rules end with a terminal, such as:\n\nNT29 is produced as NT48 NT97? Wait, no, 't48' is one of the tokens, so let's see if any NT rule has a terminal with 't48'.\n\nLooking at all terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the NT productions, each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, NT26 -> 't13'.\n\nLooking through all:\n\nLooking at NT47: NT47 -> 't51'\n\nNT11: NT11 -> 't13'\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me scan each production to see where terminals appear.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions:\n\nNT26 -> 't24'\n\nNT30 -> 't30' (maybe?)\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine each line:\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n\nNT47 -> 't51'\n\nNT46 -> 't35'\n\nNT46 -> 't2' (is that so?)\n\nWait, looking through each line carefully:\n\nLine 1: NT59 -> NT48 NT97\n\nLine 2: NT72 -> NT65 NT37\n\nLine 3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-833","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can sometimes also be on the right-hand side. But here, the non-terminals seem to be represented with numbers like NT29, NT59, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, all the left-hand sides (LHS) have a capital letter like S, NT29, NT47, etc. The right-hand sides (RHS) are combinations of two non-terminals, except the last one which sometimes has a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, except when the start symbol can produce a terminal directly. But looking at the grammar, most RHS are two non-terminals, but some have a terminal? No, actually, looking closely, the NT's always produce two NT's. Wait, but in the rules, I see something like NT5 -> NT72 NT64, and NT37 -> 't2'. Oh, so some productions do produce terminals. That makes sense because otherwise the grammar would only generate non-terminals, not actual strings of terminals.\n\nWait, so is the grammar a mix of CNF with some terminals allowed? Because in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. But in the given grammar, the productions for NT like NT37 have a terminal, so that's acceptable for a grammar that includes terminals.\n\nBut the problem is that the string to check, the 't's and such, is made up of terminals and non-terminals? Or is the string entirely made up of terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers?\n\nWait, the given string is long and seems to consist only of 't' followed by numbers, like 't48', 't93', etc. So all the symbols in the string are terminals.\n\nBut in the grammar, only certain productions have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT72 NT64, but NT37 \u2192 't2'. So the grammar allows both non-terminals and terminals on the RHS of productions. However, when the string is being generated, it can consist of a sequence of terminals where all non-terminals are expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, but the problem says the string may or may not be in the language. So the grammar is generating a string consisting of these terminals (like 't48', etc.), and the string given is such a sequence. So our job is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the string must start with two symbols derived from NT29 and NT21. Since each of these is a non-terminal, they will need to be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't48 t93 t15 t90 t30 t93 t33 t71 t80 t48 t60 t93 t49 t20 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t48 t60 t11 t49 t20 t2 t33 t91 t20 t60 t2 t11 t33 t11 t33 t13 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t23 t16 t2 t33 t60 t63'. That's 44 tokens, each starting with 't'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't93', so 't93' is a terminal. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 't50', and others. Each of these terminals appears in the string. So the problem is to see if the starting symbol S can derive this exact sequence of terminals through a series of production steps.\n\nIn CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each time we expand a non-terminal, it's replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal. The process builds the string by replacing non-terminals depth-first until all are terminals.\n\nSo, to approach this, I can model the expansion as a tree, where each non-terminal expands into two children, which could be non-terminals or terminals. The string is built by reading all the leaves of the tree in a specific order, probably left-to-right.\n\nWait, but in the CFG, the way the string is generated is by expanding the leftmost non-terminal first, which is the standard leftmost derivation. So the string is built by the leftmost expansion sequence.\n\nBut for a CFG in CNF, the derivation process can be represented as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal and has two children (either terminals or non-terminals). The leftmost derivation ensures that we process the leftmost non-terminals first, leading to the string being formed in left-to-right order.\n\nGiven that, we can model the possible derivations by building a binary parse tree for the given string, ensuring that each production is followed correctly, ending with S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a tree structure, bottom-up, using the fact that in CNF, each production (except the start symbol) is a binary tree, so each terminal in the string corresponds to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nEach node in the parse tree must correspond to a production rule, with two children. If a child is a non-terminal, it must itself be a parse tree according to its production rules.\n\nBut to do this manually for a string of 44 tokens would be time-consuming. However, given the complexity of the grammar, it might be manageable to look for a pattern or to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols should be the results of expanding NT29 and NT21.\n\nLet me look at NT29 and NT21 in the grammar to see their productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT48 NT24 (from NT29's rule, see in the beginning: 'NT29 -> NT48 NT24'\n\nSimilarly, NT21 in the string starts with 't56' as the last token, so perhaps NT20 produces 't18' and 't72', but wait, the string starts with 't48 t93 ...', I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all NT productions to better understand them.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-856","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. My task is to figure out whether the given string is a member of the language defined by the provided CFG.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. In this case, looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the first two symbols after S are NT29 and NT21. Each of these seems to break down further. For example, NT29 \u2192 NT59 NT94, wait no, looking back, actually, the productions list shows NT29 \u2192 NT48 NT24, but wait, I need to check the grammar rules given.\n\nWait, let me list out the productions step by step to see how the string might be constructed.\n\nThe given string is:\nt48 t11 t15 t23 t90 t30 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t93 t63 t2 t90 t30 t71 t93 t49 t93 t15 t2 t2 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t23 t16 t2 t56 t2 t18 t49 t50 t2 t15 t72 t49 t50 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63.\n\nI'll note that each token is a terminal, so these must be results of productions where a non-terminal is directly replaced by a terminal.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for any given terminal in the string, we need to trace back to the appropriate production.\n\nThe input string starts with t48 t11 t15... and so on. So let me check if these terminals can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can scan for each terminal what is the production that produces it.\n\nFor example, t48: Looking through the grammar, wherever a non-terminal is directly rewritten as t48. Let's see:\n\nFrom the grammar, I notice that NT93 \u2192 NT51 NT93 is not relevant. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, the grammar is written in a specific format, each production starting with a capital letter. Let me list the productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n- NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\n- NT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10\n- NT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n- NT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\n- NT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\n- NT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36\n- NT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34\n- NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- NT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n- NT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\n- NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\n- NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nWait, but looking for direct terminals, I notice that some non-terminals are replaced by two non-terminals, which in turn break down further until they end up as terminals.\n\nBut perhaps instead, I should map each terminal to the non-terminal that can produce it directly. Wait, no, because in CNF, the productions either replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each terminal must be the result of a production like A \u2192 a, but looking at the given grammar, I see that many terminals are part of the RHS of larger non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37\nNT46 \u2192 NT2 NT10\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\nNT50 \u2192 NT64 NT24\nNT41 \u2192 NT2 NT36\nNT33 \u2192 NT29 NT34\nNT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\nNT59 \u2192 NT10 NT26\nNT28 \u2192 NT37 NT72\nNT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52\nNT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nHmm, I don't see any production that directly has a terminal on the RHS. That can't be right because with only two non-terminals per production, the string must be derived by repeatedly breaking down non-terminals until terminals are reached. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan down the grammar:\n\nLooking at the rest of the productions:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n\nNT38 \u2192 NT58 NT34\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT52 NT28\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT2 NT55\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT5 NT60\n\nSo, it's possible that somewhere in the derivation, a non-terminal may produce a terminal. But looking through, I don't immediately see any production that ends with a single terminal. All are either two non-terminals or a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check all productions:\n\nLooking through the entire list, each rule has either two non-terminals or a combination like NT15 \u2192 71 NT68, etc. But do any of them have a terminal directly, like NT4 \u2192 'a'?\n\nNo, the terminal tokens are strings like t48, t11, etc., which suggests that each token is a terminal symbol. However, in the given grammar, none of the productions seem to directly produce a terminal; all RHS consist of non-terminals. This is confusing because in a typical CNF grammar, you should have some productions that directly result in terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again: for example, NT71 \u2192 10 NT65. So, no, it seems like all the non-terminals are further broken down. So how does this produce any terminals? It can't, unless the string provided includes non-terminals, which it doesn't\u2014it's all t's followed by numbers. So perhaps the grammar is actually in a different form, or I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, this is a problem. If the grammar given doesn't have any production rules that directly produce a terminal, then none of the terminal symbols can be produced. But that can't be the case because the string is given as a series of terminals. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can be derived through multiple steps, but in the provided string, the terminals are each single tokens, which implies that each step of the derivation must directly produce one terminal. So perhaps the productions actually have direct terminals as RHS, but in my initial scan, I didn't notice any.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the production rules more carefully. Let me list out all possible productions and see if any produce a terminal directly.\n\nScanning each production:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT21\n- NT47 -> NT59 NT29\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT72\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55\n- NT64 -> NT59 NT37\n- NT65 -> NT15 NT65 (redundant as it produces itself)\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34\n- NT34 -> NT64 NT55\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT60\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58\n- NT72 -> NT65 NT37\n- NT46 -> NT2 NT10\n- NT15 -> NT71 NT68\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT59 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT28 -> NT37 NT72\n- NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- NT10 -> NT5 NT19\n\nWait a minute, looking at NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT10 NT57\n\nAnd NT57 \u2192 NT68 NT2, which is another production.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nBut where is a production that directly gives a terminal?\n\nI think I need to check all productions for any that have a terminal on the RHS.

{"custom_id":"request-858","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to be evaluated. The string consists of a sequence of terminals (abbreviated as 't' followed by a number), which I assume correspond to the symbols in the grammar. The goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol S has the production rule S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, the first two parts of the string must derive from NT29 and NT21. Let me check the string: it starts with t48, t11, t15, t11, t15, ... Wait, no, S should produce NT29 and NT21, which according to the grammar, their productions are defined elsewhere.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal (like NT29, NT21, etc.) has specific production rules. For example, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58, and I can continue breaking these down until I reach terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by splitting the string into parts corresponding to the initial productions. The first two non-terminals after S must be NT29 and NT21. Let's see:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT29 NT21\nSo the string starts with NT29 \u2192 t48, then NT21 \u2192 t18 (because in the grammar, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, and NT52 is 't97' but wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the grammar, NT52 is 't63'. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, NT52 is defined as \u2192 't63'. Similarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52. So, let's track this:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34, which then NT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19. NT5 \u2192 't93', NT34 \u2192 't48', so NT55 becomes t93 t48. Then NT52 is t63, so NT21 is t93 t48 t63.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be t48 (from NT29's production?), wait no, wait. Wait, let me get this straight.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So the entire string should be the sequence of NT29 and NT21 derivations. So the first part is NT29, and the second is NT21. So the string should start with t48 t11 t15 ... Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nWait, the grammar:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\n\nSo NT29 \u2192 t93 t20.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34\nNT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19\nNT5 \u2192 't93'\nNT34 \u2192 't48'\n\nSo NT55 \u2192 t93 t48\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\n\nHence, NT21 \u2192 t93 t48 t63\n\nSo the first two parts of the string should be t93 t20 (from NT29) followed by t93 t48 t63 (from NT21). But the string starts with t48 t11 t15 t11 t15 t24..., which doesn't match. So either I'm misunderstanding or it's not aligned.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the initial step is to verify if each part can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt48 t11 t15 t11 t15 t24 t35 t2 t2 t90 t30 t90 t30 t56 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t15 t93 t63 t2 t71 t80 t11 t33 t11 t33 t30 t56 t2 t93 t97 t2 t56 t2 t2 t49 t20 t48 t2 t2 t93 t15 t60 t63.\n\nThat's quite long. Let me break it down into parts that correspond to the possible non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT29 NT21.\n\nSo the string should start with NT29's derivation and then NT21's derivation. Let's check:\n\nThe first symbol is t48. Now, looking at NT29's production:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\n\nSo NT29 \u2192 t93 t20. So the first part of the string after S should be t93 t20. However, the string starts with t48, which doesn't match. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, or the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the initial step. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S produces NT29 followed by NT21, so the entire string must be the concatenation of the derivations of NT29 and NT21. So the string must be split into two parts, first the derivation of NT29, then the derivation of NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two non-terminals are NT29 and NT21. Let's see what their expansions are.\n\nAs above, NT29 \u2192 t93 t20. So the string should start with t93 t20. But the string starts with t48, so that's a mismatch. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me double-check the production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nThen, looking at NT29: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT58\n\nNT0 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't20'\n\nSo, indeed, NT29 becomes 't93 t20'.\n\nSimilarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52.\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT10 NT34.\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nNT5 \u2192 't93'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't48'\n\nSo NT55 becomes 't93 t48'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't63'\n\nSo NT21 \u2192 't93 t48 t63'\n\nSo the initial part of the string should be 't93 t20 t93 t48 t63'.

So perhaps NT24 can produce 't24' directly. But in the string, the first word is t48. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step, considering the structure starting from S.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT29 NT21.

So the two symbols generated are NT24 and NT55.\n\nIn the string, after t48, the next parts are t87, t20, etc. So perhaps NT29 needs to be expanded into non-terminals that eventually produce these.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to check if the string can be parsed by this grammar, ensuring each symbol is generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's consider the structure:\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of terminals, so it should correspond to a derivation starting from S, expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (terminals).

Hmm, let me start by understanding what I need to do here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That simplifies parsing because each step of the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t48 t11 t15 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t56 t2 t48 t73 t50 t2 t93 t33 t93 t97 t2 t11 t15 t60 t97 t24 t50 t2 t24 t93 t49 t93 t15 t2 t2 t93 t15 t48 t11 t49 t20 t2 t33 t93 t20 t2 t93 t33 t48 t97`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nLet me first look at the start symbol, which is S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S must derive into two parts: NT29 and NT21. Each of these needs to derive into a sequence of symbols, but the full string is quite long, so I might need to see how these can combine.\n\nLooking at the productions, many of the NTs have productions that produce more NTs or terminals. For example, NT26 \u2192 NT24 NT38 or NT24 NT55, etc. But I notice that some NTs directly produce terminals. For instance, NT24 \u2192 't24', NT55 \u2192 't48', NT51 \u2192 't87', and so on.\n\nThe terminals in the string are various ts with numbers, like t48, t11, t15, etc. So I need to see if the string can be broken down into a series of productions that lead to these terminals.\n\nPerhaps I can parse the string from left to right, matching each production. Let me try to see if I can find a way.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to look for possible sequences of symbols that can be produced by the grammar. Since the string is quite long, I might look for patterns that fit the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if the string can be split into smaller chunks that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few symbols: t48, t11, t15, t87, t20, t51, t50, t2, t56, t2, t48, t73, t50, t2, t93, t33, t93, t97, t2, t11, t15, t60, t97, t24, t50, t2, t24, t93, t49, t93, t15, t2, t2, t93, t15, t48, t11, t49, t20, t2, t33, t93, t20, t2, t93, t33, t48, t97.\n\nI notice that many terminal symbols are appearing, such as t48, t11, t15, etc. These are likely to be produced by NTs like NT24 (t24), NT29 (t48 from production NT24), NT11 (t11), NT15 (t15), etc.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, some NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT26 can go to NT24 NT38 or NT24 NT55. Both of these non-terminals might lead to terminal sequences.\n\nI think I should try to find a way to construct the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAnother thought is to use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but that might be too involved for a long string. Alternatively, I can try to recursively apply the grammar rules to see if I can produce the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write out the sequence and see where it makes sense.\n\nWait, another approach is to note that from the production S \u2192 NT29 NT21, so the string should be a concatenation of what NT29 can derive and what NT21 can derive. So the entire string should be equal to the concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT29 and the other from NT21.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t48, which is produced by NT24 (since NT24 \u2192 t24, and looking at the production NT24 \u2192 't24'). But wait, in the string, the first symbol is t48, which is produced by NT29. Let's look at the NT29 production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there a production for NT29? Oh, yes, NT29 \u2192 NT87 NT20. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the productions. Hmm, I think I might have misread.

{"custom_id":"request-893","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a special form of CFG where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. This structure makes parsing easier, but for this problem, since I'm just trying to see if a string is generated, maybe it doesn't directly help with the parsing method, but it does give a form that might be easier to analyze.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that it's indeed in CNF because all the productions are either a single terminal or two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT29 NT21 is a production with two non-terminals. The non-terminals seem to have productions that either split further or eventually lead to terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens starting with t48 and ending with t15, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nSince CNF only has productions that combine two non-terminals or terminals, the string must be a result of breaking down non-terminals step by step until all symbols are terminals. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with either a terminal or two non-terminals, and the process continues until all symbols are terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I think I can start from the beginning of the string and try to parse it using the grammar. Alternatively, I can go from the start symbol S and see if by expanding it, I can generate the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right. The string is: `t48 t11 t33 t13 t2 t91 t80 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t93 t15 t91 t2 t71 t80 t93 t15 t91 t2 t2 t2 t56 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t2 t15 t48 t72 t49 t50 t2 t93 t15 t48 t11 t49 t20 t2 t93 t15 t60 t63`.\n\nWait, that's a long string. Maybe I can break it down into chunks based on the grammar. Let me try to see if each segment can be matched by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first few tokens. The first is t48. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 t24, but also other productions: NT59 \u2192 t93, etc. Wait, looking more closely at the grammar:\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT59 NT15? Wait, the user actually entered the grammar as a bunch of lines, each a production. I'll list them to make it clearer.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 t91 (from NT26 \u2192 NT59 NT37, but in the given string it's NT59 \u2192 't91', etc. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals and their productions.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT59: NT59 \u2192 t91 (from production line 12: NT59 -> NT11 but no, line 12 is NT59 -> NT11?

{"custom_id":"request-896","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I\u2019ve been given this problem where I have to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I\u2019m a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit because all the productions have two non-terminals on the right except the ones that directly produce terminals like 't48', 't2', etc. Wait, no. Let me check again. The productions are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for some that have a terminal on the right. That might be a problem because in CNF, every production should be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But here, some RHS are two non-terminals, which is okay as long as the terminals are directly connected.\n\nWait, no, actually in CNF, it's allowed for a production to have one non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right. So, that\u2019s normal. The key is that each production is at most two symbols on the RHS, with both being non-terminals in that case. So, the grammar provided does fit CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t48 t2 t2 t87 t20 t51 t50 t2 t11 t33 t30 t93 t33 t56 t30 t2 t71 t93 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t11 t15 t13 t2 t49 t11 t49 t11 t15 t2 t2 t2 t48 t60 t93 t49 t20 t2 t15 t73 t50 t2 t93 t15 t48 t63`.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK algorithm because it's efficient for parsing strings in CNF. But since I'm not very familiar with it, maybe I can try to find reductions step by step manually or look for corresponding productions.\n\nAnother idea is to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if each can be derived from some non-terminals as per the grammar. Alternatively, I could try to find the parse tree by working from the start symbol S and seeing if I can reach the given string through the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which in CNF is typically a non-terminal. In the grammar, S \u2192 NT29 NT21. So, S starts with NT29 and NT21.\n\nFirst, I need to see if the string can be generated from NT29 and NT21. Let's look at NT29 and NT21 in the grammar.\n\nNT29's productions: I see NT29 -> NT48, and also NT29 -> NT24 NT55. Similarly, NT21 \u2192 NT55 NT52, etc.\n\nBut my string starts with t48, t2, t2, which would correspond to NT29's production. Let's see: NT29 has a production NT29 \u2192 NT48, which directly produces 't48' when NT48 is a terminal. Looking at NT29's productions:\n\nLooking up NT29:\nNT29 -> NT48 (a terminal)\nand also NT29 -> NT24 NT55 (two non-terminals)\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t48, that can be derived directly from NT29 via NT29 \u2192 NT48. So that part is straightforward.\n\nNow the next symbols are t2, t2. So after t48, we have two t2s. Let's see where t2 comes from in the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT2 \u2192 't5', which is not t2. Wait, maybe NT26? Checking NT26: It has several productions, one of which is NT26 \u2192 't13'. Hmm, not t2. Or NT72: looking up, NT72 \u2192 NT65 NT37, which further breaks down. Wait, perhaps I'm looking for NT2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think I see NT2 \u2192 't73' and NT18 \u2192 't18', but not NT2. Alternatively, maybe NT38?\n\nWait, let me check each NT that produces a t2.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't35'\n- NT66? Wait, no. NT19 \u2192 't15' via some productions. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces 't2'? Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking at all the rules, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24' which is not 't2'.\nLooking further down, I see NT25...Wait, no, I think I might have missed. Wait, in the rules, I don't see any NT that directly outputs 't2' as a terminal. Hmmm.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't2' directly. Wait, that's a problem. Because the string starts with t48, then t2, t2, and so on. But if there's no NT that produces 't2', that means that t2 cannot be in the string, right?\n\nBut the string does have t2's, so either my observation is incorrect, or the answer is No.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each production again.\n\nLooking through all the RHS, each terminal is either 'tX' where X ranges from 90-something, 50, 13, etc. Wait, no NT directly produces 't2'.\n\nLooking back at the productions, do any of the rules have 't2' as a terminal?\n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'? No, that's 't5' is 't11' for NT5 \u2192 't93'; wait wait, let me check each rule.\n\nWait, looking for terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't93'? Or perhaps not. Wait, no: NT5 \u2192 't93' is a rule, but that's in a different production, not NT2.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT59 \u2192 't0', 't2', 't58', etc.\n- NT55 \u2192 't10', 't34', etc.\n- NT26 \u2192 't24', etc.\n- NT72 \u2192 't37', etc.\n- NT38 \u2192 't35', etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 't15', etc.\n- Looking for 't2': I don't see any production where a terminal is t2.\n\nWait, let me check the user-provided grammar again carefully.\n\nThe grammar is:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\nThen several lines of productions, each line starts with NTx -> followed by two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLooking through them:\n\nIs there any line where a production ends with 't2'? For example:\n\nLooking for 't2'. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLine: NT26 -> NT24 NT72\nNot terminal.\n\nNT20 -> NT2 NT55\nNo.\n\nNT29 -> NT48 (which is t48) | NT24 NT55\nYes, NT29 can produce t48.\n\nNT47 -> NT15 NT65\nNo.\n\nNT26 is used again, doesn't produce t2.\n\nNT38 -> NT58 NT34\nNo.\n\nNT58 -> NT52 NT28\nNo.\n\nNT24 -> NT10 NT55\nNo.\n\nNT39 -> NT46 NT62\nNo.\n\nNT59 -> NT0 NT58\nNo.\n\nWait, I'm looking for production rules that have 't2' as the only symbol on the RHS. If none exist, then 't2' cannot be derived from any non-terminal, hence the string cannot be generated.\n\nSince the string contains 't2' several times, and no production in the grammar has 't2' as a terminal, that string cannot be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-918","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals, or a single terminal. This structure is helpful for parsing, but since the string is given, I'll need another approach. \n\nThe string provided is `t48 t2 t2 t90 t30 t71 t80 t11 t15 t24 t35 t2 t2 t2 t48 t60 t90 t30 t2 t56 t2 t2 t48 t93 t63 t2 t56 t2 t2 t11 t15 t60 t11 t49 t20 t2 t49 t20 t2 t15 t48 t60 t11 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t60 t97`. It looks like a sequence of terminal symbols, so each token must be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to find the string in the grammar. Let's look at the production rules. The start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT29 NT21. So, the string must start with NT29 and NT21. Looking at the string, the first tokens are t48, t2, t2, etc. Wait, the initial production is S -> NT29 NT21, but in the string, the first token is t48, which is different. So, maybe S is not the start here because the first symbols don't match.\n\nWait, no. The string is in terms of t-something symbols. Let me check if any of the non-terminals produce terminals. Looking through the production rules, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT52 -> 't97', which is the end token in the string. So, the last token is t97, which matches NT52.\n\nNow, I'll need to backtrack. Let's see how the string can be constructed. \n\nFrom the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT29 NT21. So, the string must start with NT29 and NT21. But in the string, the first tokens are t48, t2, t2, t90, etc. So let me see what NT29 and NT21 produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT29 -> 't48' (I think) because looking at the rules:\n  NT29 is in NT26 -> ... and NT24 -> ..., but I see NT29 -> 't48', yes. Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT29 -> 't48' right? Yes, line: NT29 -> 't48' So, NT29 can produce t48. Similarly, NT21 is involved in S's production. Looking at NT21: \n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT21 -> NT20 NT60 and also NT21 -> 't97' Wait, no, checking the grammar, I think NT21's production is S's initial step. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT29 NT21\n\nNT26 -> NT24 NT38\n\n...\n\nLooking for NT21 in the rules: \n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT21 directly except in S's production. So, the initial step is S -> NT29 NT21, so the string must start with the concatenation of NT29 and NT21. \n\nBut the string starts with t48, t2, t2... and NT29 can produce t48. So NT29 is t48. Now, NT21 must produce the next part. Looking for NT21, do I have a production? Let me check.\n\nIn the production rules, I don't see NT21 defined as a production except in S. So, maybe NT21 is a terminal. Or perhaps NT21 can produce some other non-terminals. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't find NT21 defined as a production. So perhaps NT21 is a terminal. Or maybe I misread the rules.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nNT21 -> 't97' somewhere? Let me check.\n\nWait, searching for NT21 in the rules:\n\nNo, looking through the list, I don't see NT21 as a production; the only production starting with NT21 is line S->NT29 NT21. So perhaps NT21 is a terminal. Or maybe it's a non-terminal that can produce certain strings. Wait, in the given rules, perhaps NT21 is actually a terminal because none of the productions expand it.\n\nBut that can't be right. So maybe NT21 is a terminal symbol. Alternatively, perhaps NT21 is derived from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule for NT21. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT65 -> NT57 NT2\n\nNT21 isn't listed as a non-terminal. Wait, but NT21 is present as LHS in S's production, but it's not defined as any production. So perhaps NT21 is a terminal. If that's the case, the string starts with t48 (from NT29) followed by t21 (which we can treat as a terminal, which may not correspond to any production).\n\nWait, but in the given string, the second token after t48 is t2. So the first part is t48, t2, t2, etc. So, the first part is t48 (from NT29), then NT21. If NT21 is a terminal, what is it? If it's 't21', then in the string, the second token would be t2, not t21. That's a problem because t2 and t21 are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misreading the productions. Let me try to map everything step by step.\n\nAnother approach: the string is a sequence of t-... tokens, each being generated by a non-terminal.\n\nSo, each t-... must correspond to a production of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward to see if it can be derived. Sometimes it's easier to start from the string and see if we can find the rules.\n\nThe last token is t97, which according to the rules is produced by NT52 -> 't97'. So the last part is NT52.\n\nLooking before that, the token is t15. So before t97, the string has t15, t97. Let's see if there's a production that leads to t15 followed by t97.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the production NT51 -> 't90', but that might not help. Alternatively, let's see if any rules produce two tokens before t97. Alternatively, maybe the production is S -> NT29 NT21, but maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must be the concatenation of the RHS of the productions applied. So, for example, starting from S, S-> NT29 NT21, then each of these NTs must be replaced by their productions, recursively.\n\nThis might take a while, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to see if the string can be built step by step by expanding the start symbol.\n\nAnother idea: since S -> NT29 NT21, let's start with S, which becomes NT29 NT21. Now, NT29 can produce 't48' directly, as per NT29 -> 't48'.\n\nSo that's the first token: t48.\n\nNow, the second part is NT21, which from the initial production S, if it's a terminal, then the next tokens should start with that. But in the string, after t48, we have t2, t2, etc. So if NT21 is a terminal, it must be 't21', but in the string, we're seeing 't2', which doesn't match. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the initial production. Let me double-check: the first production is S->NT29 NT21. So after S, the next non-terminals are NT29 and NT21. Now, NT29 produces 't48' as a terminal, and NT21 can be broken down further if it's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but I don't see a production for NT21 in the list. Oh wait, maybe NT21 is in another rule. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT21 declared as a production, other than being part of S's production. That suggests that NT21 is a terminal symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-915","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's see. First, I know that context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, especially since I'm not too familiar with all the intricacies. But let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. Oh wait, actually, in CNF, the start symbol can also produce a single terminal, but all other productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, most of them are non-terminals producing two other non-terminals. For example, S -> NT29 NT21, which fits the CNF pattern. Some non-terminals, though, produce a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT34 -> NT64 NT55 (that's fine), but there are entries like NT50 -> NT71 NT37, which seems to be two non-terminals as well. Wait, actually, some are single terminals with a non-terminal, which would be problematic because in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals except the start symbol. So maybe I misread the grammar\u2014let me check again.\n\nWait, no. Chomsky normal form allows for productions of the form A -> a where 'a' is a terminal, as long as all other productions have two non-terminals on the right. Hmm, but in this grammar, some productions have a terminal and a non-terminal on the right, which would mean it's not in strict CNF. But maybe it's okay because S is the start symbol and could produce a single non-terminal which then can produce terminals. Or perhaps the grammar isn't in CNF, but the user stated it is. Hmm, perhaps I should assume it's in CNF.\n\nWait, no, each production should have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol. So in the given grammar, let's see if any production on the right-hand side is a terminal. Looking at the production rules, I see that some NTs have terminals on the right, like NT59 -> NT0 NT58. So that would mean it's not in strict CNF because NT59 produces a terminal (from NT0, which is a terminal?) Wait, no, because NT0 is a terminal. Oh wait, NT0 is one of the terminals because in some rules it produces 't93'. So the grammar contains terminals on the right side, which would mean it's not in Chomsky normal form. Because CNF requires all productions to be in the form A->BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except possibly for the start symbol which can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but the user said the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps I need to double-check. Let me look through the productions again:\n\n- S -> NT29 NT21 \u2014 okay, both non-terminals.\n- NT47 -> NT59 NT15 \u2014 okay.\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT72 \u2014 okay.\n- NT20 -> NT2 NT55 \u2014 okay.\n- NT64 -> NT59 NT37 \u2014 okay.\n- NT65 -> NT15 NT65 \u2014 wait, here on the right is NT65 again, which is a non-terminal. So that's okay.\n- NT46 -> NT39 NT59 \u2014 okay.\n- NT26 -> NT24 NT38 \u2014 okay.\n- NT38 -> NT58 NT34 \u2014 okay.\n- NT34 -> NT64 NT55 \u2014 okay.\n- NT2 -> NT5 NT60 \u2014 okay.\n- NT59 -> NT0 NT58 \u2014 here, NT0 is a terminal because later, NT0 -> 't93'. So on the right-hand side, NT59 produces NT0 (a terminal) and NT58 (a non-terminal). That's not allowed in CNF, because it should only produce non-terminals. Or does CNF allow for terminals on the right as long as it's the start symbol?\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky normal form, every production except the start symbol can have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But the start symbol S can produce either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, any non-terminal other than S can only produce non-terminals in CNF. If a non-terminal other than S produces a terminal, that's a problem because it would allow a terminal in the middle of a derivation, which isn't allowed in CNF.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I see NT59 producing NT0, which is a terminal. Since NT59 is not the start symbol S, that violates the CNF condition. Therefore, the grammar provided isn't in Chomsky normal form, which contradicts the user's statement. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, looking at the non-terminals: NT0 is a terminal because it eventually produces 't93', but in some other cases, NT59 produces NT0 NT58, which are terminals and non-terminals, respectively. So that would mean NT59 is producing a mix of terminal and non-terminal, which isn't allowed in CNF. So perhaps the user meant that the grammar is in GNF (Generalized NNF), but it's presented in CNF. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terminals are derived from the non-terminals in such a way that the production of terminals only happens in the end. No, because in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal combined with a non-terminal. So perhaps the grammar isn't in CNF as I thought. Maybe the user made a mistake, but assuming the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I need to process it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the grammar might have terminals on the right, but I'm supposed to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given string is: t48 t2 t71 t80 t48 t60 t56 t2 t93 t63 t2 t48 t60 t93 t49 t20 t2 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t11 t49 t56 t2 t11 t15 t48 t63 t11 t15 t30 t93 t49 t50 t2 t15 t2 t2 t49 t20 t2 t2 t93 t20 t2 t33 t48 t63.\n\nThat's a long string. Let's see how to approach this. One way is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Starting from S, which splits into NT29 and NT21. So the string has to start with the concatenation of a string derived from NT29 and NT21.\n\nLooking at S -> NT29 NT21, so the string should start with NT29's derivation followed by NT21's derivation. The first token is t48. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t48.\n\nLooking through the given production rules, I can check each production where the right-hand side includes t48.\n\n- NT24 -> t91 (but not relevant)\n- NT29 -> t48 (as in NT29 -> t48 NT60, since NT29 is in the rules as NT29 -> t48 NT60). Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT29 defined, but perhaps it's another non-terminal. Wait, wait\u2014wait, the given grammar has several NTs, but I'm looking for any non-terminal that has a production that includes t48 on the right.\n\nWait, the rules list:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT34 -> NT64 NT55 (no t)\n- NT29 -> Not directly listed, but looking further down, I see NT47 -> NT59 NT15, etc. Wait, perhaps the list is too long, but let's check for t48:\n\nLooking line by line:\n- Line 1: S -> NT29 NT21.\n- ... (lots)\n- Line 52: NT24 -> NT10 NT57\n- Line 54: NT21 -> NT55 NT52\n- Line 56: NT1 -> NT70 NT47\n- Line 58: ... etc.\n- Looking through, I notice that at line 12: NT29 -> t48 NT60.\n\nYes, there's a production NT29 -> 't48' followed by NT60. That's important. So NT29 can produce 't48' followed by whatever NT60 produces.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 -> 't48' is present as NT34 -> 't48' NT34. Wait, no.
