The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a CNF grammar, the only terminals appear at the start or end of the string. Since the string starts with `t49`, that suggests that the starting symbol 'S' must have a production that eventually leads to this terminal. Looking at the production rules, I see that 'S' has several options, like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, etc. But none of them produce `t` terms directly because in CNF, all productions are non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals. So the only way a terminal appears is as the result of a chain of productions that eventually lead to terminals. \n\nWait, but looking at the productions for the symbols, I see some symbols ending with 't', like NT23 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal string. Wait, no, looking more carefully, some rules like NT23 \u2192 't49' or 't94', etc. Hmm, no, actually, in the provided rules, there are some symbols that produce 't' like NT15 \u2192 't50', NT7 \u2192 't82', etc. So for instance, NT15 goes to 't50', which is a terminal.\n\nSo the string we're looking at is `t49`. Let me check if any production directly produces `t49`. Looking at the rules, I see that NT23 \u2192 't49', so if NT23 can derive `t49`, then the string `t49` is possible. So perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 ... \u2192 NT23, then NT23 \u2192 't49'. But since S has production rules that lead to other non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5? Wait, actually looking back, no: the grammar's S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5 isn't correct because in CNF, each rule has exactly two non-terminals. Wait, looking back at the grammar, actually, all the S's have different rules. Let me check the initial list:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that's three symbols. But wait, in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So this might not be correctly presented, but perhaps it's a typo, or maybe the user intended to split into two parts. Wait, looking more closely, the initial S's are written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nBut that's three symbols, which isn't allowed in CNF, which requires two symbols. So maybe that's an error in transcription. But perhaps the user intended to present each S production as two non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe it's a multi-step production.\n\nWait, regardless, let me check other S productions. For example, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, which is two non-terminals, which is correct in CNF. So maybe the first S production is a typo and should be S \u2192 NT23 NT24? Or perhaps it's an expansion of a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT23, NT24, and NT5, but that would make it a single production, which is allowed in CNF but only if those are non-terminals. But in any case, perhaps the S production that leads to NT23 is the one we can use.\n\nSo perhaps S can produce NT23 NT24 NT5, but in CNF, that would have to be broken down into multiple steps. But since the S starts derivations, perhaps S can produce NT23, which can then become 't49', making the string `t49`.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me see. The NT23 appears in several production rules, including NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, etc. Also, I see NT23 \u2192 't49' as a production, so NT23 can directly produce 't49'. Therefore, if S can produce NT23 as one of its options, then S can produce a string that includes NT23, which in turn produces 't49'. So, for example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, and then NT23 \u2192 't49', followed by NT24 \u2192 something, and NT5 \u2192 something else, but if S has a production that ends up with just NT23, then... Wait, but in the grammar, all S productions must have two non-terminals. So maybe the S production is S \u2192 NT23 NTsomething that eventually leads to 't49', but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S can produce NT23, and then NT23 can produce 't49', making the entire string 't49'. So the derivation would be S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, and then NT23 \u2192 't49', followed by NT24 \u2192 ... and NT5 \u2192 ... But perhaps that's not necessary because if any production of S can lead to a chain that ends in 't49' as a terminal symbol. But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the S can produce NT23, and from NT23, using its production NT23 \u2192 't49', the string is generated, no need for other symbols. So perhaps S \u2192 NT23 NTsomething, but wait, that's not correct. Maybe S can directly produce a single NT23, but that's not allowed because each production has exactly two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the initial S production, but assuming it's a typo, perhaps S can produce NT23, and then NT23 \u2192 't49', so the string `t49` is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the rules for NT23 and see if any of them produce 't49'. Wait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT22\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (same as above)\nNT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\nNT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nBut then looking further down, I see:\n\nWait, actually, further down I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49'\n\nYes, that's a direct production. So NT23 can produce 't49'. So if S can produce NT23, then S \u2192 NT23 ... (and some other non-terminals that perhaps derive to nothing, i.e., epsilon). But wait, in CNF, the productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So S \u2192 NT23 would not be a valid production because it's just one symbol. Therefore, the initial S production must be composed of two non-terminals. So perhaps S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5 is incorrect, but perhaps it's actually S \u2192 NT23, which would not fit CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the S production to be S \u2192 NT23 NT24, but then with another NT5, which doesn't make sense in CNF. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and all S productions are in CNF, so each side has exactly two non-terminals. Therefore, perhaps the initial S production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which would make sense.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But let me try to think differently. The string is just `t49`, which is a single terminal symbol. In a CNF grammar, to generate a string of length n, you need n-1 productions, each split into two non-terminals. Since `t49` has length 1, it must be generated directly by a non-terminal that produces it. Looking at the rules, NT23 \u2192 't49' is a direct production. So if S can derive to NT23, which can then go to 't49', then the string is possible.\n\nBut how does S derive to NT23? If S \u2192 NT23 NTsomething, but that would take two symbols. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT23 NT(something else that can derive to nothing, like epsilon). But in the given productions, I don't see any S that produces NT23 and something else. Wait, the first S production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three symbols. That can't be in CNF. So perhaps that's a typo, and it should be S \u2192 NT23 NT24, followed by S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nAssuming that, if S can produce NT23, which can produce 't49', then the string `t49` is possible. But perhaps I need to see if S can produce a chain that results in `t49` as the only terminal. For that, S would need to derive to NT23, which then directly goes to 't49'.

{"custom_id":"request-3","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string, \"t82\", and I need to determine if the grammar can generate this string. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar. It's given in a format where each rule is on a separate line, sometimes spanning multiple lines. I notice that the left-hand side (LHS) is always a single non-terminal, except for the two-terminal productions where the LHS is S and the RHS starts with t, like S -> t47, etc. Wait, no, looking again, actually, some of the rules have t followed by something, like 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7-> 't49'. So those are terminal symbols, not non-terminals. \n\nIn Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So I need to check if all the rules conform to this, and whether any of the terminals can form the string \"t82\".\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several terminal symbols like 't49', 't50', 't21', 't28', 't82', etc. So \"t82\" is a candidate as it's one of the terminals. \n\nI think the approach here is to see if \"t82\" is directly produced by any of the rules, or if it's derived from a chain of productions starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals except when it's directly a terminal.\n\nSo first, let's check if there's a rule that directly produces 't82'. Looking through the list, I see:\n\nNT7-> 't49' (line: NT7-> NT24 NT6, which is not terminal, but has 't6' which isn't directly 't82'. Wait, no. Looking in the list provided by the user, under the NT7 rule, I see NT7-> 't49'. Wait, is that correct? Wait, the user's grammar shows:\n\nNT7-> NT24 NT6\nNT7-> NT19 NT2\nBut in their list I see \"NT7 -> 't49'\", but looking again, I think the user might have a typo or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait no, in the user's provided grammar, I see lines like:\n\n\"NT7 -> NT24 NT6\nNT7 -> NT19 NT2\"\n\nAnd also:\n\n\"NT27 -> 't49' etc.\"\n\nWait, the user's provided grammar has a list where some lines are like NT7->'t49' etc. Wait, perhaps in the initial grammar, there are some rules where the RHS starts with a 't'. For example, lines like:\n\n\"NT27 -> 't49'\", \"NT15 -> 't50'\", \"NT2 -> 't47'\", etc.\n\nSo those are rules where a non-terminal (like NT27) is directly producing a terminal symbol (like 't49'). So \"t82\" must be one of these terminal rules. \n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nLine: NT27 -> 't49'\n\nLine: NT24 -> 't1'\n\nLine: NT16 -> 't59'\n\nLine: NT9 -> 't78'\n\nLine: NT11 -> 't18'\n\nAnd then others like:\n\nLine: NT20 -> 't97'\n\nLine: NT23 -> 't69'\n\nLine: NT30 -> 't80'\n\nSo looking for 't82'... Hmm, do I see any production that directly outputs 't82'? In the user's provided grammar, the line NT27 -> 't49' is a production where NT27 is replaced by 't49', not 't82'. So perhaps 't82' is generated through a chain of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the user's grammar. Let me re-examine the user's provided grammar list to ensure I'm not missing 't82' as a direct production.\n\nLooking through the lines, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't82'. The closest is NT7 -> 't49' which is line 11 (assuming lines are numbered), but I don't see 't82' being generated directly. So maybe 't82' is generated through a series of steps.\n\nSo, to produce 't82', there must be a sequence of productions starting from S and ending in 't82' via intermediate steps.\n\nGiven that, let's try to find a production chain that leads to 't82'. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the derivation might look like S -> ... -> NT... -> ... -> t82.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a non-terminal that directly produces 't82', but looking at the given rules, I don't see such a rule. So maybe the answer is No. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. Wait the user's grammar does have a line \"NT27 -> 't49'\", which suggests that NT27 is a terminal, but do we have another production for NT27 that leads to a longer chain including 't82'? Or perhaps it's possible that another non-terminal leads to it via a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the string \"t82\" is directly produced by NT27? Let me check.\n\nIn the provided grammar, line 2: NT27 -> 't49' (assuming NT27 is the LHS). Wait, looking back, the user listed \"NT27 ->'t49' (line 19)\" etc.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, line 19 says: NT19 -> NT29 NT29, and line 23 says NT23 -> NT19 NT27, etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. Looking at the user's list:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT19\n\nNT19 -> NT29 NT29\n\nBTW, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo to produce a terminal string like 't82', we must have a derivation that starts with S and eventually replaces all non-terminals with terminals until we get 't82'.\n\nFirst, let's see if 't82' is a terminal in any of the productions. Looking at the user's list, I don't immediately see 't82' as a production on the RHS of any rule. The closest is 't49' and others, but not 't82'.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's grammar includes 't82' as a production in some line? Looking closely, the user's grammar does have several lines where RHS is a terminal. For example, line 12: NT30 -> 't80', which is a terminal. Similarly, line 17: 't50' is produced by NT15, etc.\n\nWait, line 24: NT2 -> 't47', line 12: NT21 -> 't21', etc. So, in that case, 't82' is not directly produced by any rule. So unless 't82' is part of a larger chain that eventually leads to it through some production, but that's impossible because in a terminal string, all non-terminals must be expanded into terminals.\n\nBut let's check the production chain to see if any of the non-terminals can derive to 't82'. Let's think:\n\nIf any production starts with a non-terminal that can produce 't82', but from the rules, 't82' is not a production of any non-terminal. So perhaps the answer is No. However, I might have missed a rule.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the list of rules provided by the user:\n\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\n\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24\n\nNT20 -> NT26 NT0\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that 't82' is a production of a non-terminal deeper in the tree.\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see any production where the RHS includes 't82'. Therefore, it's not directly produced, and since the grammar is C.N.F., all productions must be terminals or two non-terminals. So the string \"t82\" can't be derived unless it's directly produced by some rule, which it isn't.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong because maybe 'T82' is derived from a chain where a non-terminal eventually becomes 't82'. But given the rules, since all left-hand sides are non-terminals and the only terminals are the ones with single letters, like 't49', 't50', etc., and none of these result in 't82', I don't think 't82' can be part of the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. I see that it has a bunch of production rules, mostly involving non-terminals like S, NT23, NT30, etc., and some terminals denoted as 't' followed by numbers.

So, the left-hand side must be NT24 -> t42 t42.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, is there a rule where NT24 is at the top level? Let me scan the productions. Yes, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\n\nHmm, but that doesn't directly produce 't42 t42'. Instead, looking at other NT rules, I see NT19 -> NT29 NT29, which seems to go into more non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe there's a chain of productions leading from NT24 to 't42'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production for NT24 that directly expands to 't42'. Let me check again. I think I see that NT24 -> NT5 NT19, but that's not 't42'. Let me look elsewhere.\n\nOh, I see another row: NT24 -> t1. But that's probably another rule where NT24 directly goes to 't1', not 't42'. Wait, no, 't1' is a different terminal. So maybe Nt24 can produce 't42' via another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple steps. Let me think about the NT1. Is there a production that starts with NT1? Yes, for example, NT1 -> NT0 NT3. But I'm not sure that's relevant here.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating this. Let me see: the string is two 't42's. So to get that, each 't42' must come from a NT24 production on the left-hand side of a rule. So if the grammar has a production where NT24 -> t42 t42, then yes, it can derive `t42 t42`.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, I see NT24 -> t1, but that's different. Does any NT24 production lead to two terminals? I think I might have missed it. Let me check all NT24 productions. No, the only production for NT24 is NT24 -> NT5 NT19. So it seems NT24 can't directly derive t42. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a way for NT24 to generate t42 via multiple steps. Let's see: maybe NT24 can be produced by NT5 and NT19, each of which can be broken down further. But to get 't42', I need a path from NT24 that produces two 't42's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is derived from a higher non-terminal. Let me see if S can produce two instances of ... I don't think S directly produces 't42'. S's productions are all combinations of NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I saw that NT23 can produce NT24 NT19. And NT24 can produce NT5 NT19. Maybe I can go down this chain, but I'm not seeing a path to 't42's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if 't42' is derived from any NTs. Looking at the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> t47\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT6 -> t17\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT30 -> t29\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT30 -> t29\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT24 -> t42\n\nWait, maybe in the terminal definitions, NT24 is sometimes 't42' and sometimes 't1'. So, in one rule, NT24 can go to 't42', and in another, to 't1'. But in the string, we have two 't42's. So, does the grammar allow both? If so, maybe the string can be derived from NT24 as `t42 t42`.\n\nBut how is NT24 used? The only production for NT24 is NT24 -> NT5 NT19. So, unless NT5 and NT19 can produce 't42's, that might not help. Let me check NT5's productions. NT5 can produce NT15 NT8, or directly 't26' or 't5', wait:\n\nLooking at NT5's productions:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar again. I see:\n\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT8\nWait no, that's not right. Let me recheck:\n\nAh, right: looking at the grammar, for NT5:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\n\nWait, wait, no:\n\nWait, in the initial user message, the grammar rules are listed as:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\nNT4 -> NT0 NT11\nNT4 -> NT15 NT26\nNT6 -> NT6 NT7\nNT12 -> NT12 NT22\nNT10 -> NT11 NT10\n...\nWait, so for NT5, it can only go to NT15 NT8.\n\nSo NT5 cannot produce 't42' directly, but it goes into NT15 and NT8. NT15's production is NT23 NT6, which then goes further. Hmm.\n\nThis might be getting too complicated. Let me approach it differently. To generate 't42 t42', we need to find a production where a non-terminal A can produce two 't42's. So, A -> t42 t42.\n\nLooking through the grammar, is there any production where a non-terminal A is replaced by two 't42's? Let's check each rule.\n\nI see NT24 -> t1, which is different. Hmm, looking for rules where a non-terminal expands directly into 't42 t42'. I don't see any rule in the grammar where a single non-terminal directly produces 't42 t42'. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT24 can somehow produce t42's through multiple steps. Or maybe looking at other NTs:\n\nLooking at NT23, it can produce NT5 NT25, but NT5 is NT15 NT8, and so on. Maybe that path doesn't lead to 't42's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is invalid because the grammar can't produce two 't42's. If all the productions for any non-terminal only allow one 't42' or none, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but what about NT24's rule? Wait, looking again, I might have misread the grammar. In the initial list, I see:\n\nNT24 -> t5 NT19\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the initial list, yes, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\nWait, no. Looking again, the specific lines are:\n\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT24 -> t1\nWait, but in the user message, the grammar is:\n\nHere is the initial grammar, and within it, I see this rule:\n\nNT24 -> t1\n\nSo, NT24 can produce 't1' directly"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the string \"t50 t42\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. In this grammar, I see a mix of both, with some rules having two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT23 NT24) and others producing terminal strings, such as certain NT symbols ending with 't' followed by a number, which I assume are terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's \"t50 t42\". Since this is two terminal symbols, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions. \n\nLet me start by checking the rules that directly produce 't50' and 't42'. Scanning through the grammar, I notice that NT15 \u2192 't50' and NT24 \u2192 't1'. So, one possibility is that the start symbol S can derive NT15 and another non-terminal that eventually produces 't42'.\n\nWait, but the string given is two terminals: 't50' followed by 't42'. Since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to get two terminals in a production is through a rule that produces two terminals, which would have to be in a single step. Looking at the grammar, most production rules involve non-terminals on both sides, except for some like NT5 \u2192 't26', NT7 \u2192 't82', etc. But in our case, I don't see any non-terminals that can produce two terminal strings directly. Therefore, to get the string \"t50 t42\", we must have S \u2192 NT15 NT42, where NT15 \u2192 't50' and NT42 \u2192 't42', but I don't see an NT rule for NT42, only NT24 \u2192 't1'.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check: does any non-terminal produce 't42'? Looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't1', but not 't42'. So 't42' is an individual terminal, so the only way to get 't42' is if a non-terminal directly produces it. If none of the non-terminals produce 't42', then the string cannot be generated.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't42'. There's NT24 \u2192 't1', but that's only for 't1'. I don't see NT24 leading to 't42'. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 't23', so that's 't23', and so on. So, it seems 't42' is not a terminal that any non-terminal produces.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t50 t42\" cannot be derived because 't42' is not present in the grammar as a terminal. Alternatively, if S \u2192 NT15 NTsomething, but NTsomething must produce 't42', but since there's no such rule, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked a rule. Let me go through all the terminal productions to make sure. Scanning through the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (so 't26' is a terminal)\n- NT6 \u2192 't17' (for 't17')\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT14 \u2192 't26' (so, 't26' again)\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT17 \u2192 't59' (from previous rules, looking back: Wait, in the provided grammar, NT17 is part of S \u2192 ... and some rules leading to other non-terminals. Looking again, I don't see any rule that directly gives 't59', but 't50' is explicit as NT15. Then, 't42' is from NT24 \u2192 't1', but nothing produces 't42'.\n\nSo, unless the grammar has a non-terminal that directly produces 't42', which I don't see, it's impossible to generate the string \"t50 t42\".\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again carefully. I'll list all the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT17 \u2192 't59' (Wait, in the provided grammar, one rule is NT17 \u2192 NT23 NT27, but also a comment \"NT17 \u2192 't59'\", but let me check. Looking back: The user provided a list of rules with some being production rules and some ending with 'tX'. So, for instance, NT24 \u2192 't1' is a terminal. Similarly, other rules may have terminals.

But looking at the string we need to check: \"t28 t18 t50\". So the terminals are t28, t18, and t50. \n\nFirst, I should see how these terminals are generated. From the grammar, each terminal is a specific production. For example, t28 is a terminal, so to generate it, I must have a rule where a non-terminal directly produces t28. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT20 \u2192 t97, NT8 \u2192 t91, NT28 \u2192 t80, NT24 \u2192 t1, NT5 \u2192 t26, NT22 \u2192 t28, NT20 \u2192 t97, NT18 \u2192 t92, NT12 \u2192 t29, NT26 \u2192 t23, NT30 \u2192 t29, NT7 \u2192 t82, NT26 \u2192 t69, NT30 \u2192 t86, NT15 \u2192 t74, NT24 \u2192 t42, NT16 \u2192 t59, NT9 \u2192 t78, NT11 \u2192 t18, NT2 \u2192 t62.\n\nWait, so t28 is directly produced by NT28 \u2192 t80, and also NT22 \u2192 t28. Similarly, t18 is directly produced by NT18 \u2192 t92 and NT11 \u2192 t18. t50 is produced by NT15 \u2192 t50.\n\nSo the string is t28 t18 t50. I need to see if there's a way to derive this string using the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the start symbol S. S produces combinations of NTs. The productions for S are all combinations of NTs multiplied together. The possible NT pairs for S are:\n\n1. NT24 NT24\n2. NT20 NT16\n3. NT17 NT3\n4. NT20 NT6\n5. NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can produce any of these combinations. Let's consider each possibility to see if any of them can lead to the string t28 t18 t50.\n\nLet's start with S \u2192 NT24 NT24. So we need to see if NT24 can produce factors that can lead to t28 t18 t50. Wait, but NT24 can only produce NT combinations, unless one of the NT24s produces something terminal. Let's check NT24's productions:\n\nLooking at NT24, one production is NT24 \u2192 t1 (i.e., t1), and others are combinations of NTs. So if NT24 is split into t1 and something else, but in S \u2192 NT24 NT24, both parts are NT24. So perhaps one of them produces t1 and the other something else. But the string we need is t28 t18 t50, which has three terminal symbols. So each S production would need to have three terminals. Let's check if S can produce three terminals.\n\nLooking at the first option, S \u2192 NT24 NT24. Let's see if each NT24 can produce a terminal. NT24 can produce t1, but other possibilities are combinations of NTs. So for example, if one NT24 produces t1 and the other produces, say, NT28 \u2192 t80, but that would give us t1 t80. Not three terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another path. Let's try S \u2192 NT17 NT3. NT17 and NT3 are non-terminals. Let's see what they can produce.\n\nNT17's productions:\nLooking back, NT17 \u2192 NT23 NT2 | NT23 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-42","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t94 t23 t97` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and all other productions either produce non-terminals or terminals (some seem to be 't' followed by numbers). \n\nThe string to evaluate is `t94 t23 t97`. I notice that these look like terminal symbols, which are the leaves in the parse tree. So, I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence starting from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, I check the productions for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5? Wait, no. Wait, the grammar seems to have S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 or other combinations. Wait, let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the initial grammar given is a bit confusing. Let me parse it correctly. It starts with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5? Wait, no, the initial lines are:\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nHmm, so each S production is of the form S \u2192 NTX NTY NZ, which would mean each S production is a ternary production. Wait, but CNF typically has productions with two non-terminals or terminals. So maybe each of these is actually S \u2192 NTX NTY, and perhaps there's a typo in how the productions are written. Alternatively, perhaps each production is of the form S \u2192 NTX NTY, which would still be CNF as CNF allows A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which is a production for S to three non-terminals. Wait, but that would imply the grammar isn't in proper CNF, which only allows two non-terminals. Oh, perhaps the initial lines are cut off or incorrectly formatted. For example, the first line is \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\" but that's three non-terminals, which isn't allowed in CNF. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar uses left-hand sides with multiple non-terminals, but that's not standard CNF. So perhaps I should check again. Looking more carefully, I see that in the grammar, for example, S has multiple productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nBut each of these S productions either has two or three non-terminals. Wait, maybe that's a mistake because CNF shouldn't have S with three non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps each production is S followed by two non-terminals, but the first line is mistakenly written as three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check:\n\nThe first rule under S is: S -> NT23 NT24 NT5. That's three non-terminals, which would imply the production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. But in CNF, productions are only allowed for two non-terminals or terminals. So this would mean the grammar isn't in proper CNF, which could be an issue. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and meant S \u2192 NT23, NT24, and NT5 as separate, but that still doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe each S production is a binary production, so perhaps the way it's written is as S \u2192 NT23 NT24 and then NT5? But that would be two separate productions, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps NT23 is a non-terminal that leads to another production.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to focus on the given string: `t94 t23 t97`.\n\nFirst, I should map these terminals to possible non-terminals in the grammar. The terminals seem to be strings starting with 't', like t94, t23, t97. So I need to see if these terminals can be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 't47', NT5 \u2192 't26', etc. So perhaps each non-terminal can be either a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals in the grammar have terminals as their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't47'\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\nNT12 \u2192 't29'\nNT26 \u2192 't8'\nNT27 \u2192 't49'\nNT15 \u2192 't50'\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\nNT7 \u2192 't82'\nNT6 \u2192 't17'\nNT8 \u2192 't18'\nNT28 \u2192 't80'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT9 \u2192 't78'\nNT30 \u2192 't29'\nNT23 \u2192 't69' (multiple times)\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\nNT19 \u2192 't23' (multiple times)\nNT3 \u2192 't42'\nNT1 \u2192 't62'\nAnd others are mapped to more non-terminals, like NT4, NT10, etc.\n\nSo, from this, some non-terminals resolve directly to terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't47', NT5 \u2192 't26', etc.\n\nGiven the string `t94 t23 t97`, let's map each to their possible non-terminals:\n\n- 't94' is from NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- 't23' could be from several NTs, like NT23 \u2192 't69', or perhaps another path, but let's check NT23 productions. Wait, looking up NT23 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT19 NT27\nWait, but also, in some cases, NT23 has specific terminal outputs, like in the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 -> 't69' (multiple times)\nWait, but wait, looking at the grammar rules again, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT19 NT27\nNT23 \u2192 't69' (multiple times)\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because a production can't have both non-terminals and terminals. So perhaps in the grammar, some of these are supposed to be different. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar includes both production options, meaning that NT23 can produce the terminal 't69' directly or go through other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs produce terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nSo, 't94' comes fromNT2 \u2192 't94'. So in the parse, at the top level, S must derive something that eventually leads to NT2, which generates 't94'.\n\nThen, the next token is 't23', which likely comes from NT23, which can either produce 't69' or go to other non-terminals. Similarly, the last token is 't97', which is from NT20 \u2192 't97'.\n\nSo, the string is the concatenation of 't94' (from NT2), 't23' (from NT23), and 't97' (from NT20). So the parse tree would need to have the three terminals in that order, each generated from their respective non-terminals.\n\nNow, the question is whether S can derive a sequence that includes NT2, NT23, and NT20 in that order, with the correct intermediate productions.\n\nLet's attempt a possible derivation path.\n\nFirst, S can derive via any of its productions. Let's look at the productions and see which ones might lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5\n2. S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n3. S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n4. S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n5. S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nWe need to see if any of these can lead to the target string. Since the target includes t97, which is from NT20, perhaps we can consider production 2 or 4 for S, since they produce NT20 and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at production 2: S \u2192 NT20 NT16\nNT20 can produce 't97', and NT16 can produce 't59'.

The grammar seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's structured with non-terminals (like S, NT23, NT30, etc.) and terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers like 't23', 't97', etc. My string consists of four terminals: `t23`, `t97`, `t74`, `t91`, separated by spaces. So, I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the starting symbol S by expanding the grammar.\n\nThe grammar rules are all in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form. Each production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the rules that have a terminal. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form requires each production to have two non-terminals, except that some can have a terminal when it's a base case. But looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are directly connected to terminals, like NT1 or NT2 to 't47'. So some terminals are terminals in the language.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the first token is 't23'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT23 can produce 't42' or other non-terminals. Let me check the specific rules for NT23:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT19 NT27 (Wait, no, let me check again.

Now, I see that several NT symbols have a terminal on the right-hand side. For example, NT20 \u2192 't97', which matches the first token in the string. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't91' matches the fourth token. So, looking at 't23 t97 t74 t91', I can start breaking it down.\n\nFirst token: 't23' \u2014 I need to see if there's a rule that produces 't23' directly. Looking through the rules, NT23 can produce 't42' or 't21' among other things, but I don't see a direct production for 't23' from NT23. Wait, but perhaps through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the rules, NT23 is only in the LHS of rules that produce other non-terminals, except for one rule that says NT23 \u2192 't42'. Wait, no, the last part of the rules says NT23 \u2192 't23'? No, looking again:\n\nWait, the user's grammar has at the end:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nAh, okay, looking again, NT15 \u2192 't74' is present, which is one of the tokens. So the third token is 't74', which can be produced by NT15.\n\nBut looking at the first token, 't23', I need to see if any NT can produce 't23'. From the rules, NT26 \u2192 't23' is present. So 't23' is produced by NT26.\n\nWait, so to produce the string 't23 t97 t74 t91', I need to see if I can build it step by step. Let's split the string into four tokens and see how each can be derived:\n\n1. 't23' \u2192 This can be produced by NT26 \u2192 't23'.\n2. 't97' \u2192 This can be produced by NT20 \u2192 't97'.\n3. 't74' \u2192 This can be produced by NT15 \u2192 't74'.\n4. 't91' \u2192 This can be produced by NT8 \u2192 't91'.\n\nNow, the question is, can we have these four terminals connected by the grammar rules? Because the grammar is context-free and in Chomsky normal form, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (where a is a terminal).

{"custom_id":"request-61","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the string `t21 t42 t91 t23` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the base case where A is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that there are several production rules that turn non-terminals into terminals with 't'. For example, NT26 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't50', and so on. These are the base cases where the non-terminals resolve to specific terminal symbols. The string we're checking is `t21 t42 t91 t23`, so each of these is a terminal symbol, and for the string to be valid, each of these terms must appear as results of the grammar's productions.\n\nMy plan is to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive these terminals in order. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. However, some of these non-terminals directly produce terminals. So, the string we have is a sequence of terminals, and each must appear in the derivation, possibly after a certain number of steps.\n\nFirst, let's see the leftmost symbol S. The production rules for S are:\n- S -> NT23 NT5\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, S can branch into these options. Since the string starts with 't21', which is a terminal, we need to see if any of these choices can eventually lead to having 't21' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the possible NTs that produce 't21':\nFrom the grammar, NT21 -> 't21' is a terminal, but in the rules, NT21 is present elsewhere. Let me check the production rules to see where NT21 is defined. Oh, there's a production rule NT21 -> 't21'. So, that's a terminal. Also, looking elsewhere, NT14 -> NT26 NT17, and NT26 can produce 't69' when NT26 is resolved. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a derivation path that leads to the string `t21 t42 t91 t23`. Let's break down the string into its components: 't21', 't42', 't91', 't23'. Each of these must be terminal symbols resulting from some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet's start with the first symbol, 't21'. Looking at the grammar, the only production for 't21' is NT21. So, in the derivation, one of the NTs must eventually produce 't21'. But where is NT21 defined? Looking at the rules:\n\nI don't see a production for NT21 that outputs something else. The rule NT21 -> 't21' is valid. So, that means in order to produce 't21', we can use that production directly.\n\nWait, but how does the derivation start? We have S, which can produce NT23 and NT5, for example. So, for the string to start with 't21', we need to have a path where S branches into NT23 and NT5, and NT23 is resolved to 't21', but looking at the rules, does NT23 ever produce a terminal? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, NT23 has several options, but none of them except where NT23 -> 't49' (I'm not sure, need to check). Wait, no\u2014if I look through the rules, I see NT23 -> 't49' when is that? Wait, in the rules provided:\n\nI don't see NT23 producing a terminal directly. Let me check the rules again:\n\nWait, yes, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't82'\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\n\nNT30 -> 't29'\n\nWait, but none of the NT23 productions are terminals. Hmm, so to get 't21', perhaps the production NT21 -> 't21' is used, but how would that fit into the derivation? Because S can't directly produce 't21'\u2014S can only produce combinations of NTs. So, unless one of the NTs in the S production branches into another NT which then branches into 't21', maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't21' is part of a longer chain. But in the string, it's the first symbol, so I think it's directly produced by an NT that's part of the initial expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since each symbol in the string is a terminal, each must be produced by some NT production. So, for each terminal in the string, I need to find a path from some NT to that terminal.\n\nSo, 't21' is produced by NT21 -> 't21'.\n\n't42' is produced by NT24 -> 't1' under certain rules, but wait, no. Let me check: NT24 has a production, for example, nt24 -> 't' as per some rules? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, there's NT24 -> 't1' and other rules. Wait, looking for 't42':\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see 't42' as a terminal. So perhaps that's a problem. Because if none of the NTs directly produce 't42', then the string can't be derived from the grammar, meaning the answer is no. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking again, the production rules show NT24 -> 't1', but 't1' isn't a terminal in this context. It's more likely that 't42' is a terminal symbol. Wait, maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps it's a symbol that's not defined. But in the string, it's 't42', so I need to check if there's a rule that NT24 produces 't42', or if not, perhaps via another Nt.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules. For NT24, one of the rules is NT24 -> 't1', but that's just 't1', which isn't part of the given string. Another rule is NT24 -> 't42'. Ah, yes, there's a rule NT24 -> 't42', which is good because the second symbol is 't42'. Similarly:\n\nLooking for 't91': Are there any rules that produce 't91'? Checking the rules, I don't see 't91'. Hmm, that's a problem. Similarly, 't23' is in the string, but in the rules, NT23 doesn't directly produce any of these. Wait, wait\u2014looking again, I think I might have missed some.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT21 -> 't21', which is good for the first symbol.\n\nThen, for 't42', is there a production? Yes, NT24 -> 't42'\u2014so that's for the second symbol.\n\nNext, 't91': Checking the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't91'. So that's an issue.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the NT9 is for 't91'? Let me check. NT9 -> 't78', according to some rules. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the rules, there's NT27 -> 't49', but that's not relevant. Let me make sure\u2014it's possible that 't91' isn't produced by any NT in the grammar. Then the string can't be derived. But let me double-check.\n\nLooking again through the production rules to see if any NTs produce 't91'. From the list:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n\n- NT14 -> 't91'\n\nYes! Here it is: NT14->'t91'. So, that's the third symbol: 't91' is produced by NT14.\n\nLastly, the fourth symbol is 't23'.

{"custom_id":"request-77","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because each production rule has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Here's my breakdown of the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. I have a grammar with multiple production rules for the non-terminal S and other symbols. The string to evaluate is `t21 t94 t29 t97 t94`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each production is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. Since it's in CNF, each step in the derivation will produce two symbols at most. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, right? So that means each production replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. However, when terminals are on the right side, that would be the end of the derivation.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem includes rules like S -> NT23 NT5, which means S can be replaced by NT23 and NT5. Then each of those NTs can be further substituted, until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string we're given is `t21 t94 t29 t97 t94`. Each 't' followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol. So, the string consists of five terminals: t21, t94, t29, t97, t94.\n\nEach step in the derivation produces two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, the string might have been built through multiple production expansions.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals. However, if a production has a terminal on the right, like A -> a, then that's a terminal. But in this grammar, I see a mix. Some rules have two non-terminals, others seem to have terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, it's either production rules with two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. But in CNF, I thought that all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right. So perhaps this is a mix of CNF and some other form? Or maybe some rules have right-hand sides with one terminal.\n\nBut wait, the user provided the grammar as being in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me recall: In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, I should check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT5: That's two non-terminals.\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25: Two non-terminals.\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT1: Two non-terminals.\n- NT15 -> NT8 NT24: Two non-terminals.\n- NT7 -> NT22 NT27: Two non-terminals.\n- NT1 -> NT0 NT3: Two non-terminals.\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT8: Two non-terminals.\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT9: Two non-terminals.\n- NT19 -> NT23 NT27: Two non-terminals.\n- NT18 -> NT10 NT26: Two non-terminals.\n- NT3 -> NT2 NT25: Two non-terminals.\n- NT30 -> NT9 NT7: Two non-terminals.\n- NT10 -> NT14 NT22: Two non-terminals.\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19: Two non-terminals.\n- NT19 -> NT29 NT29: Two non-terminals.\n- NT4 -> NT0 NT11: Two non-terminals.\n- NT4 -> NT15 NT26: Two non-terminals.\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT7: Two non-terminals.\n- NT12 -> NT12 NT22: Two non-terminals.\n- NT10 -> NT9 NT27: Two non-terminals.\n- NT27 -> NT2 NT23: Two non-terminals.\n- NT0 -> NT27 NT11: Two non-terminals.\n- NT21 -> NT10 NT9: Two non-terminals.\n- NT23 -> NT20 NT4: Two non-terminals.\n- NT10 -> NT19 NT12: Two non-terminals.\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2: Two non-terminals.\n- NT21 -> NT5 NT14: Two non-terminals.\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT5: Two non-terminals.\n- NT20 -> NT28 NT0: Two non-terminals.\n- NT23 -> NT23 NT21: Two non-terminals.\n- NT3 -> NT2 NT25: Two non-terminals.\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT22: Two non-terminals.\n- NT12 -> NT18 NT28: Two non-terminals.\n- NT7 -> NT23 NT2: Two non-terminals.\n- NT11 -> NT15 NT0: Two non-terminals.\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT28: Two non-terminals.\n- NT29 -> NT29 NT30: Two non-terminals.\n- NT12 -> NT29 NT9: Two non-terminals.\n- NT1 -> NT30 NT27: Two non-terminals.\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT18: Two non-terminals.\n- NT12 -> NT22 NT6: Two non-terminals.\n- NT7 -> NT23 NT2: Two non-terminals.\n- NT11 -> NT15 NT0: Two non-terminals.\n- NT2 -> NT25 NT19: Two non-terminals.\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26: Wait, this is a bit different. It's NT26 -> NT8 NT26, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014it's a non-terminal NT26 on the left, and on the right, it's NT8 and NT26. So that's okay since NT8 is a non-terminal.\n- NT27 -> NT4 NT26: Two non-terminals.\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26: Hmm, wait. So NT26 can be expanded into NT8 and NT26. But NT8 is a non-terminal, so when does the process stop?\n\nWait, but looking back, some terminals are written as 't49', 't50', etc. For example, NT2 -> 't94' is a production. So some of the non-terminals actually produce terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT5 -> 't26', which means when we've reached NT5, it can be replaced by the terminal t26. Similarly, NT22 -> 't28', and so on.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar provided, I see some rules like NT28 -> 't80', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT21 -> 't21', etc.\n\nSo, the grammar has both non-terminals and terminals, with some non-terminals expanding into terminals. So some symbols are non-terminals, and others are terminals.\n\nSo, the question is: can the string `t21 t94 t29 t97 t94` be generated from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the string has five symbols, and each production step adds two symbols at most, because each production is two non-terminals, the derivation tree will have a certain structure.\n\nEach production leads to two symbols, so starting from S, which is two non-terminals, the first step expands S into two non-terminals. Each of those can expand into two more, etc., until we reach terminals. So the number of symbols in the string depends on the number of steps.\n\nThe string `t21 t94 t29 t97 t94` has 5 tokens, which is an odd number. Wait, 5 is odd, but in a binary expansion (each step splitting into two), the number of leaves should be a power of 2, right? Because each split doubles the number of symbols. However, in this case, the string has 5 symbols, which isn't a power of two, so this might already hint that the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the grammar allows for some rules to produce a single terminal after a split. Hmm, no, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or two terminals? No, in CNF, productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, some productions produce a terminal, others produce two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, some rules produce terminals. For example, NT28 -> 't80' is a terminal. Similarly, NT23 -> 't49', etc.\n\nSo, for example, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal in a single step, then in the derivation, we could have a single token come from a terminal, which counts as one step.

Wait, actually, CNF allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each production can have two non-terminals or one terminal, not three. So, maybe the given grammar isn't in CNF, but the user said it is. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake, but I'll proceed as given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S productions were all two NTs on the right, and some may have only two. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the initial lines:\n\nThe first three S productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nWait, the first has three NTs, the others have two. That's inconsistent with CNF. But the user stated that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which typically allows each production to have two non-terminals. So perhaps I misread it. Let me re-express the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial line is S -> NT23 NT24 NT5, which has two NTs (but maybe that's a typo in parsing, and it's supposed to be S->NT23 NT24 and another production. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a formatting error, and each production only has two NTs on the right.\n\nWait, to proceed, I'll assume that each production in the grammar has two NTs on the right, perhaps some of which are terminals. Because looking at the rules, some NTs can produce terminals. For example, NT8 -> 't91' which is a terminal. So in the grammar, each production on the left (A) expands to two symbols on the right, each of which could be a non-terminal (NT) or a terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to see if the string can be derived from S via these productions.\n\nThe string given is: t28 t97 t97 t47 t91 t23.\n\nSo, the words are terminals. So each must be produced by some rule where the right-hand side includes that terminal.\n\nI can model the parsing as a top-down or bottom-up approach. Since it's a small string, perhaps a top-down approach would help, although that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe a table-driven parser like CYK would be efficient, but as I'm doing this manually, I'll try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list the productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT8 -> 't91' (I see)\nNT26 -> 't23' (yes, because in the list: NT26 -> 't23')\nNT22 -> 't28' (no, looking back: Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for all productions where RHA is a terminal:\n\nNT8 -> 't91' \u2192 Yes\nNT26 -> 't23' \u2192 Yes\nNT22 -> 't28' \u2192 From the list: looking for NT22's rules. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT22 -> 't28' \u2192 Yes, as per the list: NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't50' \u2192 Wait, maybe the 't50' is a terminal. Hmm, but in the rules, NT15 -> 't50', which is a terminal.\nWait, but the string has 't28' which is produced by NT22. Similarly, 't97' is a terminal; I need to see if any NT can generate 't97'. Let's check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nIs there any NT rule that expands to 't97'? Let me scan:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT0 -> 't27'? Wait, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't27' \u2192 No, wait:\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the rules to find which NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT29 -> 't91' \u2192 Oh, yes, NT29 -> 't91'\n- NT23 -> 't69' \u2192 Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT23 is further down and seems to have some rules ending with specific terminals.\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking for:\n\n- NT4 -> 't26' \u2192 Yes, NT4 -> 't26'\n- NT5 -> 't26' \u2192 Yes\n- NT9 -> 't78' \u2192 Yes, from NT9's rule.\n- NT8 -> 't91' \u2192 Yes, as listed.\n- NT22 -> 't28' \u2192 Yes\n- NT23 -> 't69' \u2192 Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the rules, for NT23, one of the rules is: NT23 -> 't49'. No, let me check:\n\nWait, let me find all NTs that produce terminals. I see that some of the NTs have rules that produce 't's. For instance, in the very bottom of the list, under the grammar, some have 't49', 't50', and others.\n\nWait, looking at the last lines:\n\n- NT0 -> 't27' \u2192 No, looking further down:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar:\n\n- NT18 -> 't92' \u2192 Yes, NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29' \u2192 Yes, as one of the rules under NT12 is: NT12 -> 't29' (from NT12 -> 't22', 't9')\nNo, wait, let me find the exact rules:\n\nIn the last part, under NT26: NT27 -> 't23' (but that's an NT rule)\nWait, perhaps looking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT8 -> 't91' (yes)\n- NT22 -> 't28' (yes)\n- NT29 -> 't91' (yes, from NT29 -> 't91')\n- NT4 -> 't26' (yes)\n- NT23 -> 't69' (yes, from NT23 -> 't69')\nWait, wait, no. Let me check specific rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is exactly a terminal.\n\nLet me scan through each rule, starting from the bottom:\n\n- NT29 -> NT10 NT22 \u2192 No terminals, both NTs.\n- NT12 -> NT18 NT22 \u2192 Both NTs.\n- NT7 -> NT24 NT6 \u2192 Both NTs.\n- NT22 -> NT28 NT0 \u2192 Both NTs.\n- NT26 -> NT23 NT9 \u2192 Both NTs.\n- NT20 -> NT28 NT0 \u2192 Both NTs.\n- NT15 -> NT2 NT8 \u2192 NT2 and NT8, but NT8 -> 't91' is a terminal. Wait, so NT15 can produce NT8, which can then produce 't91'. Thus, NT15 can produce something ending with 't91', but itself is an NT, so NT15's expansion may produce that 't91' later in the string.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe string is six words: t28, t97, t97, t47, t91, t23.\n\nFirst, perhaps t28 is produced by NT22 -> t28, so the first"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Now, the question is if the entire string can be generated starting from S.\n\nIn a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either is a non-terminal decomposing into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal.\n\nSince all the tokens in the string are terminals, the derivation must start from S and perform a series of productions to break down into these terminals.\n\nWe need to find a way to structure the string as a combination of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed backwards, starting from S and checking if the string can be formed by expanding the non-terminals correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the sequence of terminals can be built by concatenating the results of the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the string as the result of a leftmost derivation, but given the string is a sequence, perhaps a rightmost or middle embedding. It's a bit complex, but let's try to map it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since all the tokens are directly produced by non-terminals with single productions, the overall string can be seen as a single step production from S to a sequence that produces each token, but probably that's not the case since S is the start symbol and the string is longer.\n\nWait, wait, the given string is `t18 t94 t18 t97 t21 t69`, which is six tokens. S starts with the productions that are two non-terminals, so the initial steps would expand S into two non-terminals, each of which might further expand.\n\nBut how can we get all six tokens? Maybe there's a chain of non-terminals leading down to each token.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each token corresponds to a single production, and the entire string is a concatenation of the results of the productions.\n\nBut it's more likely that the string is a linear sequence, and each token corresponds to a non-terminal that directly turns into that token, so perhaps the derivation goes as follows:\n\nS\n-> NT23 NT5\nThen, NT23 might produce some tokens, NT5 produces others.\n\nWait, but S is split into two non-terminals, so each of those would need to further split or produce terminals.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nSuppose S -> NT23 NT5.\n\nThen, NT23 and NT5 each need to generate a part of the string. Let's see what the string is: it's six tokens, which could be split into parts that each expand from NT23 and NT5.\n\nLet me see how many tokens each part would need.\n\nWait, let's count: T18, T94, T18, T97, T21, T69 \u2192 six terms.\n\nIf S expands into two parts, then each part would expand into some tokens.\n\nLooking at the first token, T18 is produced by NT11. To get T18 from NT11, which is a single production: NT11 -> 't18'.\n\nBut how do we get that into the string. Let's try to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire string must be generated by a series of steps starting from S and replacing non-terminals with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nAn alternative way is to check if the string is a possible sequence generated by this grammar. Since the grammar is context-free, perhaps the string can be parsed by a pushdown automaton.\n\nAlternatively, since each token is directly produced by a non-terminal (i.e., each token is in the range of a production's RHS as a single symbol), we can model the string as a concatenation of the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check if the first token can be generated by some non-terminal, the second by another, etc.\n\nThe string is t18 t94 t18 t97 t21 t69.\n\nLooking up each in the grammar:\n\nt18: can be generated by NT11.\n\nt94: generated by NT2.\n\nt18 again: again NT11.\n\nt97: generated by NT20.\n\nt21: generated by NT21.\n\nt69: generated by NT26.\n\nSo, each"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me check the initial provided grammar again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under the NT sections, I see:\n\nNT21 -> NT10 NT9\n\nThat's the only production for NT21. So how does NT21 produce 't21'? Because in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly gives 't21'. Looking through the provided rules, none of the NT21 productions seem to produce 't21' directly. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for example, NT21 -> NT10 NT9, and another production such as NT21 -> t21? No, looking through the grammar, I don't see that. The only NT21 is NT21 -> NT10 NT9. So that can't be. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't21' is not a terminal, but a non-terminal that eventually expands into 't21'?\n\nWait, no. Because in the grammar, if a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it's listed. For example, NT15 -> 't50' and NT23 -> 't49' are directly producing terminals.\n\nSo if the grammar has NT21 -> NT10 NT9, and NT10 and NT9 can produce other non-terminals that might eventually produce the t terms, but in the given string, the first term is 't21', which isn't directly produced by NT21. So that's a problem because NT21's only production is to two other non-terminals, so it can't directly produce 't21' as a single step.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't21', which would require that NT21 directly produces 't21'. If the grammar doesn't have that, then it can't be generated.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm missing a production where NT21 -> 't21'. Let me scan the entire grammar again for any NT21 that produces a 't' prefix.\n\nLooking through, I don't see NT21 -> 't21'. The only NT21 is -> NT10 NT9. So that can't be. This suggests that the string can't be generated because the first symbol 't21' can't be derived from any production starting with NT21.\n\nBut wait, maybe the NT21 in the grammar might refer to a different thing. Wait, perhaps there was a typo in the grammar provided by the user. For example, perhaps the production NT21 has a terminal 't21' as an output. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see: \n\nNT21 -> NT10 NT9\n\nNT21 is defined as that. So it doesn't directly produce 't21' as a terminal. So that's a problem. Unless 't21' is produced by some other path, but that seems impossible because NT21's expansion only involves other non-terminals, and those non-terminals aren't producing 't21's either.\n\nWait, let's see: looking through other NT rules, I see NT21 is only one rule:\n\nNT21 -> NT10 NT9\n\nOther non-terminals have similar rules. For example, NT10 has a production -> NT7 NT8, etc.\n\nLooking deeper, NT10 is part of the chain that's built into the grammar. So, starting from S and expanding, can we ever get a production that includes 't21'?\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with 't21', which is a terminal. So the initial string is a series of terminals: t21, t49, t62, t80, t62, t18, t29.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only way 't21' could appear is if there's a production that directly outputs 't21', like NT21 -> 't21', which we don't have. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the first symbol can't be derived from any rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT21 is somehow expanding to 't21' through multiple steps, but I don't see any production in the grammar that produces 't21'. Since NT21 starts as NT10 NT9, and I don't see NT10 or NT9 producing 't21's, it's impossible.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first token 't21' doesn't have a production path.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-123","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t47 t82 t47 t21 t59 t62 t21`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a CFG in CNF has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it's a list of productions. Each production's left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and each right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT24 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. All the NTs are non-terminals, and some of them are expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t47 t82 t47 t21 t59 t62 t21`. Each token here is a terminal. So, I need to find a derivation starting from the start symbol S that can generate exactly these terminals in sequence.\n\nSince it's a top-down parsing approach in CNF, I can model the parsing as a series of steps where I take the leftmost non-terminal and replace it according to the grammar, each time generating two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal and another non-terminal, etc.), working from left to right through the string.\n\nThe string has seven tokens, so I need to check if there's a derivation path with exactly seven steps (since each production on the top level can produce two symbols, leading to a doubling of the number of symbols at each step until the required count is reached).\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, so we need a path that exactly consumes all these terminals without having any remaining non-terminals at the end. Also, the derivation must match the sequence exactly.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t47, t82, t47, t21, t59, t62, t21.\n\nI notice that t47 and t59 are terminals. Looking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27\n- NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT15 -> 't50' (Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking at the grammar, some of the rules are replacing non-terminals with terminals via 't'... Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has some productions where the RHS includes a single terminal, e.g., NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1, NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24, NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6, NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27, NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11, NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't94', etc. Wait, no, actually, the grammar in the provided context lists some rules as 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the terminal tokens are like t47, t82, etc. So, perhaps in the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminals directly. For example, looking at the list:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n\nBut nowhere do I see NT23 producing a 't'. However, I see:\n\nNT23 can produce NT5 and NT25, which may further produce other terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: Are there any productions where a non-terminal is directly producing a terminal 't' followed by a number? Yes, for example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- etc.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals when derived can produce a single terminal. This is crucial because each terminal in the string must be matched by such a production.\n\nSo, the string has seven terminals: t47, t82, t47, t21, t59, t62, t21.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, to generate a string of seven terminals, the derivation must replace non-terminals such that each step reduces the number of symbols as necessary to reach exactly seven terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model this as a recursive descent parser or to model the possible leftmost derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in CNF can only expand a non-terminal into two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and another symbol. Wait, but in some cases, the RHS can have two non-terminals, leading to a split, or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nBut wait, in our grammar, looking at the provided rules, all productions are either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where a is a single terminal and B, C are non-terminals.\n\nSo, each production either produces a terminal or two non-terminals. Thus, any derivation step in the leftmost parsing will process the leftmost non-terminal first.\n\nGiven this, the string `t47 t82 t47 t21 t59 t62 t21` must be generated by a series of replacements where each step expands a non-terminal until all symbols are terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to check if each of these terminals can be derived from a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a parse tree, where the root is S, which branches into two productions, each of which must generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to look for the possible replacements starting from the string.\n\nLet me try to map each terminal to a possible non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- 't47' is produced by NT22: NT22 -> 't47' (Yes, because in the grammar, NT22 -> 't47').\n- 't82' is produced by NT7: NT7 -> 't82'.\n- 't47' again is produced by NT22 -> 't47'.\n- 't21' is produced by NT21 -> 't21' (Yes).\n- 't59' is produced by NT? Let me check NT16: NT16 \u2192 't59'? Yes, because NT16 is defined as NT9 NT19, which further expands to NT5 NT20 via NT19's production. Wait, no. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking in the grammar, NT16 is defined as NT20 NT8, which is further replaced. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look through the grammar again to see which non-terminals end up producing each 't' in the string.\n\nLet me list each 't' in the string and see where they can come from.\n\nt47 \u2192 NT22.\n\nt82 \u2192 NT7.\n\nt47 \u2192 NT22.\n\nt21 \u2192 NT21.\n\nt59 \u2192 Let's see: I need to find a non-terminal that can derive 't59'.

I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t21 t42 t28 t62 t94 t86 t82 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should look at the provided grammar to understand how the symbols produce the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. That simplifies things because I don't have to worry about longer left-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the string, I see symbols like t21, t42, etc. I recall that in CNF, some of these terminals might be non-terminals that expand into other terms or terminals. So, I should check which non-terminals might produce these t's.\n\nI notice that there are several productions that end with 't' like nt21 -> t21, nt8 -> t8, nt15 -> t15, etc. So, 't21' could come directly from nt21 if the production rules generate them directly. But I need to see if the sequence of these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces pairs of non-terminals. Let me try to build the string step by step, breaking it down into parts.

According to the grammar, nt21 -> t21. So, t21 must come from the production nt21 -> t21. That means somewhere in the derivation, we have nt21 on the stack or in the sentential form.\n\nNext, t42. Looking for productions that produce t42. I see nt24 -> t1, which isn't t42. Wait, let me check. There's nt24 -> t1, which would produce 't1'. There's also nt1 -> t94, because nt1 -> t94.

Let me see: the productions at the end have nt7 -> 't82', nt8 -> 't91', nt23 -> 't49', and others. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Or maybe the t42 comes from a different production. Let me check: nt24 produces t1, and nt4->t26, etc. Wait, I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck all the terminal productions in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- nt7 -> 't49'\n- nt15 -> 't50'\n- nt2 -> 't47'\n- nt21 -> 't21'\n- nt8 -> 't91'\n- nt28 -> 't80'\n- nt24 -> 't1'\n- nt2 -> 't94' (Wait, nt2 is mentioned twice?

Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the last part of the grammar:\n\n... \nNT2 -> NT25 NT19\nNT26 -> NT8 NT26\nNT6 -> NT11 NT14\nNT2 -> NT25 NT19\nNT26 -> NT2 NT19\nNT26 -> NT4 NT29\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\nNT19 -> NT6 NT19\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\nNT23 -> NT16 NT16\nNT28 -> NT4 NT22\nNT23 -> NT4 NT23\nNT25 -> NT30 NT11\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\nNT8 -> NT9 NT19\nNT23 -> NT16 NT16\nNT28 -> NT24 NT23\nNT5 -> NT10 NT17\nNT26 -> NT12 NT7\nNT27 -> NT4 NT26\nNT7 -> NT23 NT2\nNT23 -> NT27 NT16\n...\nWait, at the very end, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't94'\nNT21 -> 't21'\nNT8 -> 't91'\nNT28 -> 't80'\nNT24 -> 't1'\nNT2 -> 't94'\n\nSo, nt2 can produce 't94' via two different productions.\n\nSo, going back, the string is t21 t42 t28 t62 t94 t86 t82 t69.\n\nSo t21 comes from nt21->t21.\n\nt42: Looking for a production that generates 't42', but I don't see any in the terminal productions. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Because in the provided grammar, the only terminal productions are the 't's. So t42 must come from a non-terminal that eventually produces 't42' via a chain of productions.\n\nWait, that's impossible because the only way to produce a terminal like t42 is via a production rule that ends with it. But the grammar doesn't have any such production. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, let's make sure I'm not missing any. Let me list all the terminal productions again:\n\nnt7 -> 't49'\nnt15 -> 't50'\nnt2 -> 't47'\nnt21 -> 't21'\nnt8 -> 't91'\nnt28 -> 't80'\nnt24 -> 't1'\nnt2 -> 't94'\nnt21 -> 't21'\nnt8 -> 't91'\nnt28 -> 't80'\nnt24 -> 't1'\nnt5 -> 't26' (Wait, no, nt5 has a production nt5->nt10 nt17. Then nt10->nt19 nt12, etc.)\n\nWait, looking for any terminals except t21, etc., I don't see t42. So, that suggests that t42 is not a terminal that can be produced directly. Therefore, it might not appear in the language of this grammar at all, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, the string does include t42, so I must have made a mistake. Maybe it's produced indirectly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So, all the strings in the language will consist of terminals (like t's and numbers) formed by the specified rules.\n\nBut in the provided string, 't42' is present. Since I don't see a production that directly or indirectly produces 't42', that suggests that 't42' is not part of the language. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe the number 42 is inside a production. Let me check the grammar again. For example, looking at the rules around numbers:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, but I don't see 't42' as a terminal. The only terminals are nt7->t49, nt15->t50, nt2->t47, nt21->t21, nt8->t91, nt28->t80, nt24->t1, nt2->t94, etc.\n\nSo, there's no production for t42. Therefore, the string contains a term that's not in the generated language.\n\nHence, the answer should be No, because 't42' isn't produced by any rule in the grammar, so the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar to see what the starting symbol is. In the provided grammar, I notice that all the productions start with S. For example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT5\nS -> NT20 NT16\n... and so on.\n\nSo the start symbol is S. That means any valid string generated by this grammar must start from deriving S. The string we're given doesn't have any markers indicating where each production leads to the terminal string t's. So, I need to see if there's a way to expand S into the given string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's, and each t seems to correspond to a specific non-terminal symbol. For example, t92 is mapped to NT18. That makes me think that each t represents a specific production path from the start symbol. So, I should check if each t in the string is reachable from S through some sequence of productions.\n\nI'll list each t in the string and see which NT they map to:\n\n1. t92 \u2192 NT18\n2. t47 \u2192 NT26 (Wait, looking back, I think I saw that NT26 can produce t23 or something else? Or maybe I misremembered. Let me check again. Wait, in the grammar, there are some terminal symbols. For instance, NT26 can lead to 't23' somehow, but not t26. Wait, in the grammar, it says NT26 -> 't23', so maybe that's a terminal. But in our string, t47 is in there, so I need to see what NT that corresponds to.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I'm a bit confused. There are some productions where non-terminals are rewritten into other non-terminals, and some where they become terminals, denoted by 't' followed by a number. For example, some rules end with 't49' or 't23' etc.\n\nSo, let's map each t in the string to the NT it comes from:\n\nLooking at the string: t92 t47 t1 t97 t49 t82 t78 t21\n\nAssuming each t followed by a number is the result of a derivation step where a non-terminal was replaced by a terminal.\n\nSo, let's match each t to possible NTs:\n\nt92: from the grammar, I see NT18 -> 't92', so NT18 produces t92.\n\nt47: Looking through the rules, NT26 -> 't47'?\n\nWait, I need to check all the rules to see which NTs map to t47, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nWait, so that's not t47. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking for any production rule where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example:\n\nNT15 -> 't74'\n\nWait, but in the string, t47 is present. So perhaps I missed a rule where NT47 is defined.\n\nWait, perhaps each t corresponds to a specific NT. So each t like t47 is the terminal form of a specific NT. For example, NT47 might produce t47, but in the grammar provided, I don't see NT47. Hmm, perhaps the numbers after t are unique identifiers for each terminal. But since the grammar only has certain terminals, it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all the terminal productions in the grammar. Let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking for any productions where the right-hand side (RHS) starts with a letter 't'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT29 -> 't49'\n\nWait, maybe each t like t49 is the result of a specific NT. Wait, perhaps each t... is a terminal symbol assigned to each NT. Like NT49 produces 't49'.\n\nWait, maybe that's how it's structured. So, each nt X produces a terminal 'tX', where X is a number. So, NT18 would produce 't18', but our string has t92, t47, etc.\n\nWait, in the string given, it's 't92 t47 t1 t97 t49 t82 t78 t21'.\n\nSo, each tX is the terminal form of NTX.\n\nTherefore, t92 is the terminal generated by NT92, t47 by NT47, etc.\n\nSo, in the grammar, the non-terminals must produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll list all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT30 -> 't30' (I think, but it's written as 't80'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 is written as \"-> NT5 NT25\", but I also see some 't's:\n\nNT18 -> 't92'\n\nNT28 -> 't80'\n\nNT24 -> 't1'\n\nWait, actually, looking through all the rules, the ones that generate t's are the ones where the RHS is a string with t followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT18 -> 't92' \u2192 So, NT18 produces 't92'\n\nNT28 -> 't80' \u2192 NT28 produces 't80'\n\nNT24 -> 't1' \u2192 NT24 produces 't1'\n\nOther rules like NT25 -> 't30' (I think) because it's written as NT25 -> 't30', so NT25 produces 't30'.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> 't49', as in NT23 -> 't49' (from looking at the list). Or is it NT29 -> 't49'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules again, for example:\n\nNT23 has several productions, but in the given grammar, some of them are:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nWait, no, that's the production where NT23 is rewritten into other NTs. The ones that generate terminals are:\n\nNotably, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n\nWait, looking further, perhaps I missed some. For example, NT25 -> 't30':\n\nYes, towards the end:\n\nNT25 -> 't30'.\n\nAlso, near the bottom:\n\nNT8 -> 't91'\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nWait, and others.

So, for example, NT23 can produce 't49', NT24 can produce 't1', etc.\n\nSo, to get the string t92 t47 t1 t97 t49 t82 t78 t21, each of these t's must be produced by a specific NT.\n\nSo, let's map each t in the string to the NT it comes from:\n\nt92 \u2192 NT18 (since NT18 -> 't92')\n\nt47 \u2192 Wait, is there an NT47 in the grammar? Or perhaps t47 comes from a different NT.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking for NTs that produce 't47'. Let me scan the RHS:\n\n- NT29 -> 't49'\n\n- NT23 -> 't49' ?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all the RHS again.\n\nLooking back, in the given grammar, the productions that produce 't' are:\n\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n\n- NT25 -> 't30'\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n\n- NT10 -> 't27'\n\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n\n- NT28 -> 't42'\n\n- NT4 -> 't26'\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-163","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t94 t80 t59 t78 t74 t92 t18 t92 t26`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because all productions either have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is derived from this grammar, I'll probably need to perform a parsing process, maybe using a CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite short, perhaps a bottom-up approach like the Earley parser would be more manageable.\n\nLet me list the steps I think I should take:\n\n1. **Identify Terminals and Non-terminals:** From the grammar, terminals are all strings ending with 't' followed by a number. The non-terminals are names like S, NT23, etc., but most seem to have been replaced with terminals based on the grammar provided. Wait, actually looking closer, the grammar has some rules that produce terminals, like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, etc., but there are a few rules that directly produce terminals like 't49', 't50', etc. So the string consists entirely of terminal symbols, and the grammar defines how to produce these terminals.\n\n2. **Check the Structure of the Grammar:** The grammar seems somewhat complex with many non-terminals, but perhaps I can find a way to trace back the string step by step. The given string is `t94 t80 t59 t78 t74 t92 t18 t92 t26`. Each 't' followed by numbers. \n\n3. **Find Starting Symbol:** The starting symbol is S. The productions from S are:\n   - S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n   - S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n   - S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n   - S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n   - S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo, S can produce combinations of non-terminals leading to these terminals. Let's see how the string starts: it begins with t94. So looking at the grammar, which productions can produce t94?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\n- NT25 \u2192 't30' (from NT25)\n- Wait, actually, NT25 \u2192 't23' according to the rules: \"NT25 -> 't23'\". But I'm confused because in the given string, the 't94' is at the beginning. So I need to look for non-terminals that can derive to 't94'.\n\nBut wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that immediately produces 't94'. For example, NT7 has some rules that derive to other non-terminals but none directly to 't94' except via other steps. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't94' is a production: \"NT2 -> 't94'\". So if the string starts with 't94', that could be derived directly from NT2.\n\nSimilarly, maybe the rest of the string can be built from NT2.\n\nSo, let's consider that 't94' comes from NT2. So the first part is NT2.\n\nNow, the entire string would be: NT2 t80 t59 t78 t74 t92 t18 t92 t26.\n\nSo, S \u2192 ... \u2192 NT2 something else? Wait no, S can only directly go to combination of two non-terminals. But if S is to produce a string of non-terminals that eventually derive to the terminals, maybe S can produce a chain that leads to the starting NT2.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is 't94' which is from NT2 -> 't94'. So, the initial step is NT2.\n\nNow, the entire string begins with 't94', so before NT2, what non-terminals can produce it? It's a single terminal, so its parent must be a non-terminal that directly produces it. From the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't94' is a production, so that's possible.\n\nSo, the entire string is NT2 followed by other symbols. But S is the start symbol, which can only produce two non-terminals initially. Wait, no, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so the start symbol S must derive a sequence of terminals, meaning that S must expand into a string of non-terminals that ultimately produce the given terminals in order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from expanding the start symbol into a tree where the leaves are the terminals in the correct order. Let me think about the possible derivation.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be parsed from left to right using a pushdown automaton or by building a parse tree.\n\nStarting with S, perhaps the string begins with 't94' which comes from NT2. So, perhaps the root is S \u2192 NT2 (something). Wait, but S has several options; maybe I need to see which option can lead to the beginning t94.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nNone of these directly produce 't94' except perhaps NT23 could eventually lead to 't94' via a chain of productions. But wait, NT2 has a production that goes directly to 't94', so if the string starts with 't94', that suggests that in the derivation, S must produce something that includes NT2 as one of the non-terminals in the chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built as S \u2192 NT2 (something) \u2192 ... \u2192 t94 ... \n\nBut wait, since S can only produce non-terminals in pairs, to get 't94' as the first symbol, perhaps the S must first expand into a chain that leads to NT2 as the first symbol, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string doesn't start with t94, because looking at the grammar, S can't directly produce t94 as its first symbol, because S's productions are all combinations of two non-terminals. So perhaps the first symbol of the string must be derived from the first non-terminal of S's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the first symbol of the string. The string starts with 't94', which is NT2. Looking at S's productions, none directly produce t94, except maybe via a non-terminal connected to S.\n\nWait, but S's productions all have two non-terminals. So the first symbol in the string must come from the first non-terminal in S's expansion. Therefore, S's first production must generate a non-terminal that can produce 't94'.\n\nLooking at S's first production: S \u2192 NT23 NT24. So NT23 is the first non-terminal, and NT24 is the second.\n\nIf the string starts with 't94', then perhaps NT23 must derive to a string that starts with 't94'. So, let's look at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 can produce NT5 NT25, or 't59' NT7, or 't8' NT27, or 't1' NT19, or 't42' NT16, or 't49' (but I think I might have misread; looking back, a rule says \"NT23 -> 't49'\", so that's a terminal). \n\nWait, let's list all NT23's productions accurately:\n\nLooking back:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n2. NT23 -> NT6 NT9\n3. NT23 -> NT9 NT4\n4. NT23 -> NT20 NT4\n5. NT23 -> NT11 NT1\n6. NT23 -> 't49'\n7. NT23 -> 't91'\n8. NT23 -> 't69'\n9. NT23 -> 't23'\n10. NT23 -> 't19'\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me re-examine the given grammar's NT23 productions:\n\nYes, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT23 has several rules:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT9\n- NT23 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT23 -> NT20 NT4\n- NT23 -> NT11 NT1\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT23 -> 't91'\n- NT23 -> 't69'\n- NT23 -> 't23'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n\nSo NT23 can directly produce some terminals like '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-161","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t26 t50 t18 t50 t97 t50 t59 t28 t78\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar seems a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and productions. Chomsky Normal Form typically involves productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Here, the start symbol is S, and from there, the string must be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, the symbols start with t26, t50, and so on, ending with t78. So I'm looking for a path through the grammar that starts with S and ends up with this sequence of terminals.\n\nI notice that t26, t50, t18, etc., are terminals, while the rest are non-terminals. The grammar has several rules that link these non-terminals to each other and to the terminals. My goal is to see if I can find a derivation starting from S that results in this string.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for S. There are five options:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, actually, that's not correct. Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production from S should have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. However, looking at the given grammar, the S productions are:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 (three non-terminals on the right)\n- S -> NT20 NT16 (two non-terminals)\n- S -> NT17 NT3 (two non-terminals)\n- S -> NT20 NT6 (two non-terminals)\n- S -> NT9 NT5 (two non-terminals)\n\nWait, so one production (S -> NT23 NT24 NT5) has three non-terminals. That seems incorrect for CNF because CNF requires A -> BC. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but assuming that the rest are correct, I'll proceed.\n\nFirst, I'll check which of the S options could potentially have t26, t50, etc., in their derivation. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the S productions:\n\n1. NT23, NT24, NT5\n2. NT20, NT16\n3. NT17, NT3\n4. NT20, NT6\n5. NT9, NT5\n\nI need to see if these can lead to the given string.\n\nLet me look at the terminal symbols: t26, t50, t18, t97, t50, t59, t28, t78.\n\nStarting with t26, let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce t26 when expanded. Looking through the grammar, I see NT26 -> 't23', which is a terminal. So NT26 can produce 't23'. Hmm, but the string has t26, not t23, so that might not directly help unless I can find a connection.\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT26 -> 't69' (from productions where NT26 appears), but actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT26 -> NT8 NT26\n\nNT26 -> NT4 NT29\n\nNT26 -> NT12 NT7\n\nNT26 -> NT11 NT19\n\nWait, but in the terminal rules, I don't see NT26 producing t26. Wait, let me check again. Checking each NT rule:\n\nLooking for 't26':\n\n- NT26 -> 't23' (No)\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan through all the non-terminals.\n\nAh, looking for 't26', I see that in the grammar, NT26 has a production that ends with 't26'. Let me check:\n\nNT26 -> 't26' appears where? Let's go through the list:\n\nLooking through all NT rules, I find:\n\nNT26 -> 't23' (NT6 -> 't28', etc.), but perhaps I'm mixing up the symbols. Wait, perhaps I should list out all the NT rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, some NT productions produce terminals, while others don't. For example:\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\n\nNT28 -> 't80'\n\nNT19 -> 't49'\n\nNT23 -> 't50'\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a table of NT rules that produce terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT rules that have 't' followed by some numbers:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT23 -> 't49'\n\nNT15 -> 't50'\n\nNT2 -> 't94'\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nNT22 -> 't28'\n\nNT20 -> 't97'\n\nNT18 -> 't92'\n\nNT12 -> 't29'\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some NT productions produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\n- NT23 -> 't50'\n\n- NT15 -> 't50' (Wait, NT15 -> 't50')?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nLet me go through each line:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nNo, that's a production to non-terminals. Then:\n\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\n\nStill non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NT -> 't*':\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\n\nNo.\n\nNT28 -> 't80'\n\nNo.\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nWait, looking for NTs that produce 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking at all the NT rules, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't26' ?\n\nWait, no. Let me check each rule line.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nI think I'm misunderstanding the grammar notation. It seems that some rules produce terminals, while others produce non-terminals. For instance, NT26 -> 't69' is a production that results in the terminal 't69'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't94' is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is given in a mix of CNF and some rules produce terminals. Let me check the structure.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25: two non-terminals.\n\nNT26 -> 't23': one terminal, but in CNF, all productions should have either one terminal or two non-terminals. So this might be incorrect, unless it's allowed to have a production with a single terminal as well, which would be BNF, not CNF. So perhaps the initial problem statement is incorrect, but I'll proceed assuming that some NT rules can produce terminals.\n\nAnyway, looking for terminal rules:\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nNT23 -> 't50'\n\nNT15 -> 't50'\n\nLooking at the string, which has t26, t50, t28, t50, etc.\n\nNow, the string starts with t26. So in the derivation, the first step must involve a non-terminal that can produce t26 or lead to t26.\n\nLooking for which NT can produce t26 as a terminal:\n\nNT5 -> 't26' (line where NT5 is defined)\n\nAlso, perhaps other NTs. Looking through all NT rules:\n\nI see:\n\nNT12 -> NT29\n\nNT29 -> NT29 NT30\n\nBut that's more about non-terminals. However, looking at NT26 -> 't26' isn't present. Wait, in the given list, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, in the NT26 line, the rule is:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nNT26 -> NT8 NT26\n\nWait, no, let me re-examine the entire list more carefully.\n\nActually, given the confusion, perhaps I should parse the entire grammar correctly.\n\nLet me list all NTs and their productions:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-175","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the given string `t42 t23 t29 t74 t91 t49 t23 t28 t49 t42` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) is a set of production rules, and the string should be derivable from the start symbol S using these rules. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, denoted by lowercase letters. For example, `NT28 -> 't42'`, so t42 is a terminal symbol, and similarly for others. \n\nThe string consists of these terminals: t42, t23, t29, t74, t91, t49, t23, t28, t49, t42. It ends with t42, which I see in the grammar (NT28 \u2192 't42'). So the last symbol is a terminal.\n\nIn CNF, a derivation starts from the start symbol, which here is S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or two terminals. The string should be a sequence of such replacements, ultimately leaving only the input string after several steps.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse from the start symbol S. The given grammar has S \u2192 NT24 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, S \u2192 NT17 NT3, S \u2192 NT20 NT6, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, etc. Each of these RHS is two non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the parsing will expand S step by step, each time replacing a non-terminal with two others until all non-terminals are replaced and only terminals remain.\n\nLet me attempt a step-by-step approach, seeing if I can match the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t42. In the grammar, t42 is a terminal. So perhaps t42 comes from a production like NT28 \u2192 't42'. So look for the left-hand side (LHS) of such a production. Yes, NT28 \u2192 't42' is present.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t42. This suggests that in the derivation, some non-terminal must have produced t42 as the last step. So perhaps we have ... \u2192 NT28 \u2192 t42.\n\nLooking at the previous steps, the second token is t23. So the second symbol is t23. Now, to get t42 followed by t23, let me see if any production has t42 followed by t23.\n\nLooking for NT28 where NT28 \u2192 't42' and perhaps another non-terminal connected to it. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the entire string and see how the non-terminals can be produced.\n\nAnother approach is to try to build the string from the top down. The string is `t42 t23 t29 t74 t91 t49 t23 t28 t49 t42`. Let's list them in order: 0: t42, 1: t23, 2: t29, 3: t74, 4: t91, 5: t49, 6: t23, 7: t28, 8: t49, 9: t42.\n\nEach t is a terminal. So we need to see if each t is produced from a non-terminal via a production.\n\nLooking at t42: it comes from NT28 \u2192 't42'.\n\nt23: which non-terminal produces t23? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, the grammar has NT23 \u2192 NT25 NT19, but also NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2, etc. Wait, I'm looking for t23 as a terminal. Wait, no: in the grammar, the productions for non-terminals only result in either two non-terminals or a terminal? Wait, no. Looking back, in the grammar, some rules, like NT23 \u2192 't23'? Wait, actually, I need to check the entire grammar.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar for any production where a non-terminal goes directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT29 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nSo, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't97' \n\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't78'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nOk, so these non-terminals produce specific terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t42 t23 t29 t74 t91 t49 t23 t28 t49 t42.\n\nSo starting from the beginning:\n\n1. First: t42 \u2192 comes from NT28 \u2192 't42'\n\n2. Next: t23 \u2192 comes from which non-terminal? Checking the list above, NT23 isn't in the list, but NT26 \u2192 't23'. So to get t23, we need a production of the form A \u2192 t23. The non-terminal that does this is NT26 \u2192 't23'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t42 is t23. So in the derivation, it's ... \u2192 NT28 \u2192 't42' and then another non-terminal X \u2192 't23'. So perhaps X is NT26, which produces 't23', but that would require that in the derivation, after getting 't42', we also get 't23' from NT26. But how would these connect?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's another non-terminal that produces t23 as part of a larger production.\n\nWait, to get t42 followed by t23, we need a production such that somewhere in the RHS of a production, there is 't42' followed by 't23'. However, each production only replaces one non-terminal into two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and another symbol.\n\nWait, but in the string, each symbol is generated in sequence, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which may include terminals. So perhaps the derivation is a sequence of such steps.\n\nLet me think again: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where one non-terminal becomes two. So the derivation builds the string by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nBut the grammar is given in CNF, so each production has two symbols on the RHS. So each expansion replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. Terminals can't be further expanded, so the derivation must end when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nTherefore, the entire string is built by replacing each non-terminal in the derivation with two symbols until only terminals are left.\n\nSo let's consider the string `t42 t23 t29 t74 t91 t49 t23 t28 t49 t42` and see if it can be broken down into the productions.\n\nFirst, note that the entire string has 10 tokens, each represents a terminal.\n\nLooking at the first token, t42. This comes from NT28 \u2192 't42'.\n\nSo the first symbol comes from NT28, so in the derivation, there's a step where NT28 is replaced by 't42' and another symbol. Wait, but in CNF, NT28 would need to be replaced by two symbols, say X and Y, both terminals or non-terminals. Since 't42' is a terminal, it can't be expanded further. So perhaps, the production is NT28 \u2192 t42 B, where B is another terminal or non-terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the productions for NT28: the grammar I see doesn't have NT28, but in the question, the last productions are like `NT23 -> NT23"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-181","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided, and the string to check is \"t91 t1 t42 t26 t97 t86 t26 t1 t42 t78\". I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) can sometimes be analyzed by working backwards\u2014starting with the string and seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first thing I notice is that the string starts with \"t91\", which makes me think I should check which production rules lead to \"t\" symbols. From the grammar, I see that some NT symbols, like NT15, NT23, etc., produce terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string: t91, t1, t42, t26, t97, t86, t26, t1, t42, t78. Each of these might correspond to specific production rules.\n\nStarting from the left, \"t91\" could be produced by either NT15 or NT23, looking at the NT rules. Checking NT15: NT15 -> 't50' (which isn't in our string) or NT23 could produce 't74' or 't42', but 't91' isn't directly a terminal in the given grammar. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps \"t91\" is produced by another NT.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT24 -> 't1', but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Also, NT5 -> 't26', which is in the string. Maybe \"t91\" is from NT15 because NT15 can go to 't50' or 't74', but that's not matching. Hmm, maybe \"t91\" is from NT26, but I don't see a direct production for that. Alternatively, perhaps the string is actually composed of a series of symbols that can be reduced step by step.\n\nAnother approach: each production in the grammar splits symbols into two. The string has 10 symbols, which is even, so each step would reduce it by one, ending with S at step 0. Let's try to count the number of symbols. The string has 10 symbols, so each reduction would halve them. 10 to 5 to 2 to 1. Wait, but that's not the usual way, because each step replaces a symbol with two, so to get down to one symbol (S), we need a number 1 that's a power of 2. 10 isn't, but maybe it's possible with some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to derivations. Let me consider that. The string has 10 symbols, which is 2^3 + 2, which isn't a power of two. That might complicate things, but maybe not.\n\nLet me look at the string again: t91 t1 t42 t26 t97 t86 t26 t1 t42 t78. Let me group them into possible leftmost derivations.\n\nStarting with S -> NT23 NT24, since that's one of the initial productions. So S reduces to NT23 NT24. Then each of those NTs would have to produce the corresponding symbols.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT23 has multiple productions. For example, NT23 -> NT5 NT25 and NT23 -> NT6 NT9. Also, NT23 can produce NT16 if applicable.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t91, which I'm not sure is directly produced by any NT. Let me check all NTs that produce terminals. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 has 't50', which is T50, but not T91. Similarly, NT26 can produce T69 or T23? No, T91 is not directly listed as a terminal for any NT. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look more carefully. For NT23, are there any productions that lead directly to a terminal? Looking at:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT23 -> NT16 NT16\nNT28 -> NT4 NT22\nWait, NT28 can produce 't80', but that's not in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some other NT can produce terms like t91, t1, etc. Let's check NT26: NT26 has productions like -> NT8 NT26, which isn't a terminal. But wait, is there any NT that directly produces a 't' terminal? Looking through the rules, I see NT15 can produce 't50', which is T50, but not T91. NT23 can produce 't74' or 't42' if I look at the rules. Wait, no. Let me check the given grammar in more detail.\n\nWait, the grammar provided in the question has several rules that produce 't's. For example:\n\nNT23 -> 't74' in some production, but looking through, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Oh wait, the grammar shows rules like NT23 -> NT5 NT25, etc., so perhaps the 't's are products of these terminal productions.\n\nWait, looking again, for instance, NT25 -> 't49' (if line 27) and 't30' via other lines. Wait, no, some NTs produce 't' directly.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't1'\nNT5 -> 't26'\nNT22 -> 't28'\nNT26 -> 't69' and 't23'\nNT28 -> 't80'\nBut wait, the string includes 't91', which I don't see being produced by any NT in the grammar. That's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see several 't' endpoints:\n\n- NT23 -> 't74' (as per line 17: NT23 -> NT16 NT16, and line 19: NT23 -> NT6 NT9; but no 't's here)\n- NT15 -> 't50' (line 3)\n- NT2 -> 't94' (line 2)\n- NT21 -> 't21' (but that's a non-terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't9' in NT8's rules: line with NT8 -> NT1 NT28 (no t's), NT8 -> NT23 NT2 (no), NT8 -> NT18 NT16 (no), NT8 -> NT1 NT23 (no), and NT8 -> 't91' (wait, let's check NT8's rules: looking through the lines, I see NT8 -> 't91' in one of the rules (looking at line 81: NT8 -> NT28 NT16, no. Wait, line 80: NT28->'t80'. Line 84: NT8->'t91'? Let me check the entire user message.\n\nLooking back, the grammar provided does include:\n\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n\nAh, yes! So NT8 can produce 't91' as one of its productions. So that's a key point.\n\nSo, given that, the string starts with 't91', which would come from NT8 -> 't91'.\n\nSo, the first symbol of the string 't91' comes from NT8.\n\nThen, the remaining part of the string is t1 t42 t26 t97 t86 t26 t1 t42 t78.\n\nNow, let's try to see how that can be produced.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S can produce NT23 NT24. So, the first step would be S -> NT23 NT24.\n\nWhich would mean that each of these two NTs must produce parts of the string. But the first symbol is T91, which is from NT8, not NT23 or NT24. So perhaps I need to find another production that starts with S and leads to T91 somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: work backwards from the start symbol.\n\nThe last symbol in the string is 't78', which could come from an NT with a production to 't78'. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT5 has NT5->'t26'\n- NT22->'t28'\n- NT8->'t91'\n- NT9->'t78' (as per line 90: NT9 -> 't78'. Yes, so NT9 can produce 't78'.\n\nSo the last symbol is 't78', which comes from NT9.\n\nNow, stepping back, the second last symbol is 't42'.

So, for example:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't80', meaning that NT30 can produce the terminal t80.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't69' (so NT26 can produce t69), NT22 \u2192 't28', NT23 \u2192 't82', etc.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can try to match each terminal in the string with a production that results in that terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two NTs or a terminal. Thus, in a derivation, each terminal must come from an NT production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nSo, starting with the entire string:\n\nt80 t69 t47 t28 t23 t28 t92 t1 t1 t50 t74\n\nWe can parse from left to right, matching each terminal with a production. Let's start with t80.\n\nLooking for an NT that can produce t80. Checking grammar rules, I see NT30 \u2192 t80.\n\nSo, t80 corresponds to NT30.\n\nNow, moving to the next term: t69.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t69. From the grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 t69.\n\nSo, t69 is NT26.\n\nNext term: t47.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t47. Hmm, checking grammar, I don't see a production for NT* \u2192 t47. Maybe t47 is a terminal and perhaps it's directly given as some NT produces it, but in the grammar rules provided, I don't see any NT producing t47. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Looking through, I see the grammar lines only have certain t's.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the lines, I don't see any production that directly maps an NT to t47. Wait, perhaps the t47 is an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions. Let's see.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some. Let me check the entire grammar again for any t47. No, looking through all lines, I don't see any NT directly mapping to t47. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but perhaps t47 is part of a longer derivation. Maybe the NT in some rule can produce t47 via intermediate steps. Let me think: t47 is the third token after t80 and t69.\n\nIf the third token is t47, but in the grammar, there's no direct production for it, maybe we can find an NT that can produce a string that starts with t47. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps NT15 can produce t50, as per the rule NT15 \u2192 t50. So, let's see, if I have to parse t80, t69, t47, t28, etc., perhaps I need to find a way to get t80, then t69, then t47 from the same NT production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to parse t80 as NT30.\n\nThen, for t69, that's NT26.\n\nFor t47, the third term, perhaps an NT that can produce t47 as part of a production. But in the grammar, it's not present. Unless I'm missing a rule where an NT produces t47 via another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in not seeing the production for t47. Let me carefully check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the lines, I don't see any production where an NT produces t47. So, perhaps the third token t47 cannot be matched by any NT, which would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But maybe I'm wrong because perhaps t47 is an internal production.\n\nWait, perhaps t47 is part of a longer chain. Maybe I should look for a production where an NT eventually produces t47. Let's think recursively.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's productions go to NT23 and other NTs.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach. I need to parse the string step by step. Let's list the entire string again:\n\nt80 t69 t47 t28 t23 t28 t92 t1 t1 t50 t74\n\nLet me process each token, trying to find a path through the grammar.\n\n1. t80: From the grammar, NT30 \u2192 t80. So, t80 is NT30.\n\n2. Next, t69: NT26 \u2192 t69. So, t69 is NT26.\n\n3. Next, t47: Looking for NT that can produce t47. Wait, perhaps the NT is NT26 again, but NT26 produces t69. Hmm, or perhaps it's another NT. Let me check if any NTs can produce t47. From the grammar, I don't see any NT directly mapping to t47. So, this term t47 might be problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps t47 is generated through a chain of productions from an intermediate NT.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This makes it suitable for using parsers like CYK, but since I'm doing this manually, I need to see if I can break down the string step by step using the available productions.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t97 t74 t91 t78 t50 t18 t97 t49 t82 t50 t28`. It consists of 11 tokens separated by spaces. Each token represents a terminal or a non-terminal production.\n\nI should check each terminal token to see if it's present on the right side of any production as a terminal. From the grammar, I notice that several symbols end with 't' and then a number. Let me list out all the terminal symbols here:\n\n- t97\n- t74\n- t91\n- t78\n- t50\n- t18\n- t97\n- t49\n- t82\n- t50\n- t28\n\nLooking at these, I see that some terminals might be directly produced by the start symbol S.

Alternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, I can try to apply the productions in a way that matches the string.\n\nLet me note that some terminals are introduced by non-terminals. For example, NT23 might produce t74, and NT20 might produce t97, etc. So, I'll need to map each terminal to its corresponding production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that certain NT symbols map directly to terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t82\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT18 \u2192 t92\nWait, but t92 is not in the string, but let me check.\n\nWait, the string has t97, t74, etc. Let me find which non-terminals produce these.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nBut NT5's productions: looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17\nAnd NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2\nNT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\nWait, but this seems too deep.

Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. The start symbol is S, and the grammar consists of several production rules. My goal is to see if by applying these rules, I can derive the given string.\n\nThe string starts with \"t1\", which immediately makes me think about the production rules that produce terminals. Looking through the rules, I notice several that start with NT followed by two terminals, like NT5 -> t26, NT7 -> t82, etc. Additionally, some NT rules produce combinations of NT and symbols, but ultimately they must derive into terminals.\n\nI should also note that some NT rules produce more complex structures, like S -> NT23 NT24, which would require further expansion into terminals. Since the string has multiple t terms, I need to see if each t is directly produced by a rule or if there's a chain of productions that can create each t.\n\nLet me list out the t terms in the string:\n\nt1, t62, t49, t78, t28, t80, t42, t1, t1, t21, t49.\n\nI'll go through each t to see their possible sources:\n\n1. t1: Looking at the rules, I don't see a direct NT -> t1. However, some NT rules might derive into t1 through a chain. For example, if there's a rule that expands into NT1, and NT1 expands into t1, that could work. Wait, reviewing the rules, I see NT1 -> NT0 NT3 and NT0 -> NT27 NT11, but no direct t1. Hmm, maybe t1 is directly produced by NT24. Looking at the rules, NT24 -> t1, so indeed, NT24 directly produces t1. So that's one occurrence handled.\n\n2. t62: Similarly, I check if any NT rules directly produce t62. Scanning the rules, I don't see NT -> t62. So I would need to find a chain of NT productions leading to t62. Perhaps NT2 or NT26 could produce t62. Let's check. Looking at NT26 rules: there's NT26 -> NT8 NT26, which might lead to t23 or something else. Wait, looking further, NT8 -> NT1 NT28, but I don't see NT8 leading directly to t62. Alternatively, NT6 -> NT17 NT3 and NT17 -> NT19 NT2, which doesn't help. Another approach: NT22 -> t28, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, I see NT26 -> t23, which might not be helpful. I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should track down each t in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking for any rule that connects directly to t's. For example, some NT's directly produce t's:\n\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT23 can produce t49, t28, etc. Wait, looking at the rules: NT23 -> t42, t16, t69, etc. Not directly t49. Hmm. Maybe NT1 -> t47? No, I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking again, I notice that the rules are all in Chomsky Normal Form, which is two symbols on the right side of each production. So each step either replaces a non-terminal with two others, or a terminal, but in this case, the only terminals are the t's and some have direct t productions.\n\nLet me make a list of NTs that directly produce t's:\n\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT23 -> t42, t1, t16, t69, etc.\n- NT25 -> t30, t11\n- NT2... perhaps others. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, I find:\n\n- NT17 -> t59\n- NT19 -> t62, t23 (from NT19 -> NT6 NT19, but I'm not sure if that's useful.)\n- NT27 -> t82\n- NT8 -> t91\n- NT28 -> t80\n- NT4 -> t26, t22\n- NT6 -> t17, t3\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- And more. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the string, I have t1, t62, t49, etc. Let me check for direct t's:\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT19 directly produces t62. So that's good because the string includes t62. Also, NT8 -> t91, but the string has t78, which might be produced by NT15, which is NT15 -> t74. Wait, that's t74, but the string has t78. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me go through each t in the string and see if I can find a direct rule or a chain.\n\n1. t1: As I thought before, NT24 -> t1. So that's covered.\n\n2. t62: As mentioned, NT19 -> t62. So that's covered.\n\n3. t49: Looking for any NT that directly produces t49. I don't see any rule that directly does that. So I need to see if t49 can be derived from some NT that eventually produces t49 through other productions.\n\n4. t78: Looking for a production that produces t78. From the rules, NT20 -> t97 (no), NT21 -> t21 (no), NT3 -> t25 (no), NT9 -> t78? Wait, no, because I don't see a rule where NT9 -> t78. Alternatively, looking at NT15 -> t74, but that's t74, not t78. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see NT7 -> t82, but I don't see NT9 -> t78. So t78 might come from NT15 -> other terms, but I'm not sure. Let's think: NT15 -> t74, which comes from NT15 -> t74. So t74 is there, but the string has t78. How does t78 get there? Wait, maybe NT15 rules: NT15 -> NT2 NT8. So if NT2 produces something that leads to t78. Looking at NT2: NT2 -> NT94 (t2 is t94?), or wait, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nNT2 -> t94 (I think that's NT2 -> t94, as per the last line: NT2 -> t94). So NT2 produces t94. Then, since NT15 -> NT2 NT8, so if NT15 expands to t94 (from NT2) and then NT8 expands to something. Looking at NT8: NT8 -> t1 NT28 (if I'm reading correctly), where t1 is t1 (from earlier) and NT28. NT28 expands to, for example, in some rules: NT4 -> t26, but maybe NT28 can expand to t80 (t80 is in the string).\n\nWait, the string has t80 as another element. So perhaps the production chain is as follows:\n\nt78 could be produced as NT15 -> t74 is nt15 -> t74, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let me check if any NT can produce t78.\n\nLooking at the rules: NT15 -> t74, yes? Because looking at the rules, I see NT15 -> 't74' as per the line: NT15 -> 't74'. Wait, is that right? Let's see: the rules are listed as strings. So yes, NT15 is assigned to 't74'. So if t78 is not directly produced by any rule, then how does it get there? Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NT rules.\n\nWait, another approach: construct parse trees manually.\n\nThe string is: t1 t62 t49 t78 t28 t80 t42 t1 t1 t21 t49.\n\nSo, let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, t1 can come from NT24. So maybe the leftmost symbol is NT24 -> t1.\n\nThen, after that, we have t62. How does t62 come in? NT19 -> t62 is direct.

{"custom_id":"request-215","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t69 t47 t97 t29 t82 t92 t50 t29 t97 t86 t28 t74` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a standard form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. The non-terminals seem to be letters like S, NT23, NT30, etc. Each production rule splits the non-terminals into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers and some single letters like 't49', 't50', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has several productions. Each production outputs two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 and so on. So to generate a string, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two others until all are terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: `t69, t47, t97, t82, t92, t50, t29, t97, t86, t82, t28, t74`. Wait, no, looking back, the string is written as one string separated by spaces, so it's a sequence of single 't' followed by numbers and some are two letters, like t97 or t29. Wait, no, looking at the string, each part is `tXYZ` where XYZ is a number. For example, t69, t47, etc., which suggests that the grammar's terminal symbols include these specific strings. Hmm, but in the grammar, I see entries like NT23 -> NT9 NT4 or NT10 -> NT9 NT27, etc. The terminals seem to be certain nodes that ultimately lead to 't' followed by numbers. For example, in the rule NT23 -> NT7 NT4, and looking further down, NT19 -> NT29 NT29, which eventually might resolve to 't82', 't69', etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to work backwards from the string, trying to see if each terminal can be generated from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t69 t47 t97 t29 t82 t92 t50 t29 t97 t86 t28 t74. Wait, but in the grammar, some of these terminals are actually non-terminals. For example, NT23 -> 't82', but in the given string, t82 is a terminal. So perhaps each 'tXYZ' is a terminal, and the grammar has production rules that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has some terminals represented as 't49', 't50', etc., but also other productions that lead to 't's like t69, t47, etc. So each of these t's is a terminal, and the non-terminals are the other symbols like NT23, NT7, etc.\n\nSo the process is similar to a reverse parse: can each part of the string be generated by the grammar?\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. It starts with t69. So we need to find a production rule that produces t69. Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't82', which might be a way to get t82, but t69 is another terminal. Let me check if any of the productions result in t69. Looking through the rules, I notice that some rules end with 't's, like NT7 -> 't82', NT3 -> 't1', etc. But I don't see a rule that produces t69 directly. Hmm, maybe I need to look further. Oh, looking at NT23 -> 't49'? No, that's not it. Wait, maybe the 't69' is part of a larger production. Wait, let me list the productions that have 't's:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT23 -> 't82'\n- NT23 -> 't69' (Wait, let me check the given grammar again.)\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't immediately see any production that results in t69. Wait, perhaps the 't69' is part of a larger production. For example, if a rule produces 't69' as part of a larger chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to think about how the string can be split into parts that correspond to productions.\n\nLet's see the string: t69 t47 t97 t29 t82 t92 t50 t29 t97 t86 t28 t74.\n\nI'll consider the string as a sequence of 12 terminals. Since the grammar uses Chomsky normal form, each step combines two symbols, but the order matters. So the process would involve working from the start symbol S and replacing it with two non-terminals, which can then be further replaced until the string of terminals is formed.\n\nAlternatively, to see if the string can be built, we can parse it by finding the rightmost non-terminal, but that might be more complicated. Maybe the easier way is to see if each terminal in the string can be obtained from some non-terminal, and the sequence can be built from the start.\n\nLooking at the string, let's list the terminals:\n\n1. t69\n2. t47\n3. t97\n4. t29\n5. t82\n6. t92\n7. t50\n8. t29\n9. t97\n10. t86\n11. t28\n12. t74\n\nNow, each of these t's must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules produce t's directly. For example:\n\n- NT1 -> 't94'\n\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n\n- NT28 -> 't23'\n\n- NT19 -> 't92'\n\nBut I'm supposed to find if each t in the string is produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first t, t69: looking at the productions, I see NT26 -> 't69'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first t is produced by NT26.\n\nSimilarly, t47: I need to check if NT47 exists, but the given grammar's non-terminals end with 'NT' or 'T' letters, like NT23, NT30, etc. Wait, perhaps t47 is a typo, but in the string, it's 't47', so perhaps t47 is a terminal derived from a non-terminal NT47. But I don't see any production for NT47 in the given grammar. So maybe t47 is not in the language. Wait, but in the grammar, looking through the productions, I don't see any rule that produces t47.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking for where the terminals are:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT19 -> 't74'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT4 -> 't26'\n- NT5 -> 't26' [Wait, NT5 -> 't26' but looking at the production NT5 -> 't26'? Let me check.\n\nWait, each production in the grammar seems to have rules of the form X -> YY, where YY are combinations of NT and T's.

{"custom_id":"request-239","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t21 t21 t26 t26 t50 t91 t47 t69 t82 t49 t47 t74 t94`. My task is to determine whether this string can be derived from the given grammar, step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols, or a terminal symbol alone. This structure is helpful for parsing and makes it easier to analyze derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a (where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal), or S \u2192 a. Now, the start symbol is S, and the terminals are all the symbols that are written as 't' followed by numbers, except for 't47', 't50', etc., which might actually be terminals or non-terminals. Wait, in the grammar, some symbols are written as 'tX', and others are non-terminals like NT23, NT30, etc. So, the terminals in the string are 't21', 't26', 't50', etc. The non-terminals would then be those on the LHS of the production rules, such as S, NT23, NT30, and so on.\n\nBut wait, I think I need to clarify: in the provided grammar, some symbols like NT23, NT30, etc., are non-terminals, and others like 't21', 't26', etc., are terminals. So when parsing the string, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals that need to be expanded into other symbols.\n\nNow, the string is `t21 t21 t26 t26 t50 t91 t47 t69 t82 t49 t47 t74 t94`. Each token is a terminal, and I need to see if these terminals can appear in a leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nTo approach this, I can model this as a recursive descent parser or think about the possible ways the string can be derived. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nAlternatively, thinking in reverse: since the grammar uses CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal. Therefore, each token in the string must be a terminal, and the structure must fit into the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, but in the given string, all the elements after t26 are two-digit numbers, so they're all terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if this sequence can be generated from the grammar starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each terminal must come from a production where it appears directly in the RHS as a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, some of the RHS consist of terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11, but wait, I might be mixing up the symbols here.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, many of the productions have only non-terminals on the RHS, except when specified. For example:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n- NT7 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT3\n- And so on. These seem like all productions are non-terminals leading to other non-terminals, except in cases where a terminal is present, like:\n\nWait, on closer look, some productions actually seem to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either:\n\nA \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals,\n\nor A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, all the productions on the right side are composed of non-terminals except when the RHS is a single terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, the right-hand sides are mostly two non-terminals. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. Wait, is that correct? Wait, no, looking at the first line:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that's three symbols on the right, which would violate CNF because CNF requires that a production has exactly one non-terminal on the left and two symbols (non-terminals or terminals) on the right. Wait, actually, CNF allows the productions to have two symbols, so perhaps this is a typo or maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar format.\n\nWait, hold on. The initial presentation says the grammar is in CNF. So each production must have exactly one non-terminal on the left, and the right side must be exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. But in the given grammar, the first line says S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three symbols on the RHS. That's not CNF. Hmm, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, let me look again. Oh wait, looking at the first four lines:\n\nFirst line: S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nSecond line: S -> NT20 NT16\n\nThird line: S -> NT17 NT3\n\nFourth line: S -> NT20 NT6\n\nFifth line: S -> NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these has S on the left and three NT symbols. Wait, that can't be CNF. Wait, perhaps I misread, maybe each line has two symbols after S. Let me check:\n\nThe first line says S -> NT23 NT24 NT5. That's three non-terminals on the RHS, which is not possible in CNF. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe the way it's presented is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lines are just formatted in a way that each production is on a separate line, and each line after S has two symbols. Let me check again. Wait, no, the first line is S followed by three NTs: NT23, NT24, NT5. That's three symbols, which can't be. Maybe there's an error in the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me re-examine each production:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 \u2192 3 symbols\n- S -> NT20 NT16 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT17 NT3 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT20 NT6 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT9 NT5 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nAh, so the first production for S has three symbols, which violates CNF. That's odd. Alternatively, perhaps the formatting was incorrect, and the actual RHS for S is two symbols. Maybe it's a typo in the problem. Because CNF requires two symbols in the RHS for each production except possibly the start symbol, which can sometimes have a single terminal if S is a terminal. But in this case, S is the start symbol, so S must derive other non-terminals or terminals, but the RHS can't have three symbols.\n\nThis discrepancy throws me off, because if the grammar isn't properly in CNF, my approach breaks down. Alternatively, maybe the first production is a typo, and it's supposed to have two symbols. Let me proceed assuming that the first production for S is a typo and it's supposed to be, say, NT23 NT24.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line after S represents a separate production, with the RHS being two symbols, but the way it's presented is overlapping lines. Alternatively, maybe the first production is a multi-symbol, which complicates things. But given the conflict, perhaps the problem intended S's productions to each have two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see all the productions and count the RHS symbols:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 \u2192 3 symbols\n- S -> NT20 NT16 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT17 NT3 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT20 NT6 \u2192 2 symbols\n- S -> NT9 NT5 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nThen, for NT23: NT23 -> NT5 NT25 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT1 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT22 NT27 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nNT1 -> NT0 NT3 \u2192 2 symbols\n\nAnd so on, most other productions have RHS of two symbols.\n\nSo the only problematic one is the first S production having three symbols. That's conflicting. But since the problem says it's in CNF, perhaps the initial S production is a mistake, and it's supposed to have two symbols. For the sake of proceeding, I'll consider that the first S production is a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and there are several productions from S. \n\nThe given string starts with `t97` and ends with `t21`, all of which are terminals. I notice that the string has a lot of `t97`, `t94`, and `t49`, which are likely results of non-terminal productions. \n\nLet me start by mapping each terminal to a non-terminal production. Looking at the right-hand sides of the productions, these terminals are results of specific non-terminals. For example, `t49` comes from NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, and then NT6 and NT9 have their productions. But perhaps it's easier to look for each terminal in the productions and see where they come from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can simulate the derivation process. Let's see. The string is a series of 13 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each derivation step increases the number of symbols by 1, so starting from S, each step either keeps the same number or increases by one. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (which would increase the length by 1) or a terminal (which would replace it with a terminal, no change in length). So the total length of the string must be compatible with the number of steps.\n\nThe string has 13 tokens, so the derivation from S must have 13 - 1 = 12 steps (since S is one symbol, and each step adds at least one symbol, but in CNF it can be more depending on the productions). Hmm, maybe not the exact way, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string is a leftmost derivation. So let's try to parse the string step by step, starting from S and deriving the string.\n\nThe first symbol is `t97`. Let's see what non-terminal produces `t97`. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30 (and according to the right-hand side, NT26 and NT30 have their own productions)\nWait, actually, I need to check where `t97` comes from. Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT97. Instead, I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar, most of the non-terminals produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So I need to see which non-terminals produce `t97`, `t47`, etc.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with non-terminals like NT23, NT30, etc. Each of these has a production that sometimes leads to another non-terminal or a terminal. \n\nLet me list the right-hand sides that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 nt94\n- NT0 \u2192 nt27 nt11\n- NT4 \u2192 nt0 nt11\n- NT1 \u2192 nt3 nt25\n- NT7 \u2192 nt24 nt6\n- NT24 \u2192 nt5 nt19\n- NT19 \u2192 nt6 nt19\n- NT23 \u2192 nt6 nt9\n- NT23 \u2192 nt9 nt4\n- NT15 \u2192 nt8 nt24\n- NT5 \u2192 nt10 nt17 (Wait, nt10 is another non-terminal)\n- Oh, this is confusing. Maybe I should map each terminal to their origin.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look at the string and see if each token can be matched by the right-hand side of some production in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t97 t47 t97 t94 t49 t94 t97 t69 t94 t23 t21 t28 t21`.\n\nLet me list each token and see which production could generate it:\n\n1. t97\nLooking through the productions, I don't see a non-terminal that directly produces t97. Wait, maybe t97 comes from a sequence of non-terminals. So perhaps I need to see which non-terminal can produce t97, either directly or via several steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I can see where t97 appears in the productions. Looking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- NT23: nt9 nt4 \u2192 nt9 is NT9, which produces NT5 and NT3 \u2192 NT5 produces NT10 and NT17, and some other non-terminals. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go step by step and try to parse the string.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first symbol is t97. So let's find a production that starts with t97. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see any production that starts with t97 itself. Instead, it's likely that t97 is the result of a production. Maybe NTxxx \u2192 t97.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 nt94\n- NT5 \u2192 nt10 nt17 (but nt10 is another non-terminal)\n- NT22 \u2192 nt23 nt11\n- NT30 \u2192 nt3 nt1\n- NT7 \u2192 nt24 nt6\n- NT24 \u2192 nt5 nt19\n- NT19 \u2192 nt6 nt19\n- NT23 \u2192 nt6 nt9\n- NT23 \u2192 nt9 nt4\n\nWait, I think I'm not getting this right. Perhaps I should check the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the first few productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT5\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\nAnd these are all the productions for S, which start with NT23, NT20, etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t97. Let me see what non-terminal could produce t97. Looking at the other productions, I don't directly see a production that leads to t97. So perhaps t97 comes from a non-terminal production, such as NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, but then NT26 and NT30 would have to produce t97.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t97 is produced by NT26 or NT30. Wait, in the productions, NT26 has two possible productions: NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26 and NT26 \u2192 NT2 NT19. Hmm, that's more like a recursive production, which might not be helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me list all the possible RHS that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4 \u2192 NT9 can produce NT5 NT3, etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30 \u2192 NT26 and NT30 could produce other terms\n- NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11\n- NT1 \u2192 NT3 NT25\n- NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16\n- NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT22\n- NT12 \u2192 NT18 NT28\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2, oh that's another production for NT7\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28\n- NT20 \u2192 NT17 NT8\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n- NT15 \u2192 NT23 NT6, wait, but earlier in the list, NT15 is different? Wait, the line says NT15 -> NT23 NT6. Then later, NT5 -> NT10 NT17, etc.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to try to find for each token in the string which non-terminal can produce it directly. Then, we can see if the sequence of these can form a valid derivation.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. t97: Which non-terminal can produce t97? Looking through all the productions, none directly produce t97. So maybe t97 is a result of a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but looking through the productions, perhaps t97 comes from a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-256","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t28 t94 t74 t49 t94 t80 t74 t69 t82 t62 t92 t18 t74 t29`.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a terminal. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nGiven the grammar, the only terminals are words ending with 't' followed by a number. For instance, 't28', 't49', etc. The terminals here are t28, t94, t74, t49, t94, t80, t74, t69, t82, t62, t92, t18, t74, t29.\n\nSince the starting symbol is S, we need to see if S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial productions all involve S \u2192 NTsomething NTsomething. So, S can only start with two non-terminals, each of which eventually can produce a terminal string.\n\nBut wait, the provided string starts with t28, which is a terminal. However, in CNF, all productions have two non-terminals on the right side. This suggests that S can't directly produce t28. So, does that mean the string can't be derived?\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. In CNF, every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, to generate a terminal string, each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals, until we reach the bottom where a terminal is produced.\n\nBut if S is supposed to start with S \u2192 NT23 NT1, or something like that, then the first step would be S \u2192 NT...NT..., which would then have to be expanded further. So, the initial symbol can't directly produce a terminal; the entire process starts with two non-terminals, and each non-terminal step may produce two other symbols until all are terminals.\n\nSo, in contrast, the string starts with t28, which is a terminal. But the only way to get to a terminal is if a non-terminal can derive it. But in CNF, each production leads to two non-terminals, meaning that to get a single terminal, there would have to be a production that directly produces it. However, in this grammar, looking at all the rules, they all seem to be either non-terminals deriving other non-terminals or a single non-terminal producing a terminal and another non-terminal, except some have just two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the last part of the provided grammar, I see that some non-terminals seem to produce terminals, like `NT22 -> 't28'`, `NT23 -> 't69'`, etc. Oh, that's different. So, actually, some productions in the grammar do produce a single terminal, like NT22 \u2192 t28, which is a terminal symbol. That\u2019s critical because it means that the grammar can produce terminal strings by having non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nSo, the grammar is a mix: some productions are A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals), and some are A \u2192 a (a single terminal). That's valid CNF, right? Wait, no, CNF is specifically that every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but every production must have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side (non-terminals or terminals). So, in CNF, a terminal can only appear in place of a single non-terminal production. So, for example, the production N -> a is allowed because a is a single terminal, but in the grammar provided, it's in the right-hand side as a terminal. So, perhaps the grammar includes both forms.\n\nSo, in this case, the grammar has both types: some non-terminals produce two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT23 NT1), and others produce a single terminal along with a non-terminal, like NT22 \u2192 t28, or NT4 \u2192 t22, etc. \n\nSo, with that in mind, the process to derive a string would involve each non-terminal breaking down into two components, until terminals are reached.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the provided string: `t28 t94 t74 t49 t94 t80 t74 t69 t82 t62 t92 t18 t74 t29`.\n\nThis is 14 tokens, so the derivation would have to involve a parse tree where each step splits into two, but ultimately leads to 14 leaves, each being a terminal.\n\nBut let's see the string step by step. The first step is t28. Looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t28. So, perhaps the first non-terminal could be NT22, which breaks down into t28 and something else.\n\nBut wait, let's see if t28 appears on the left side of any production. Looking through the grammar, yes: NT22 \u2192 t28, which is a production. So, the first part of the string, t28, can be derived from NT22, which is N -> a.\n\nBut then, the next token is t94. Looking for t94 in the grammar: is there a production that produces t94? Let me check: looking through all rules, I don't immediately see any production that directly produces t94 as a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 t15, but not t94. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 t15, etc. Wait, so is there any NT that directly produces t94?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar's end, I see that NT22 \u2192 t28 (no), but maybe elsewhere? Let me check again. For example, looking for 't94' in the productions: Yes, looking through the list, I see: NT22 \u2192 't28', NT25 \u2192 't30', NT15 \u2192 't50', and others. Wait, is there any NT that produces t94?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the productions again. Looking for t94: Let's see, NT22 \u2192 t28, NT25 \u2192 t30, NT15 \u2192 t50, etc. Wait, perhaps there is a production for NT2? Let me check all the lines.\n\nWait, under the grammar, I have:\n\nLooking at the end of the list: 'NT21 -> t21', 'NT23 -> 't49'', etc., but maybe t94 is elsewhere. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT19 \u2192 t92, NT28 \u2192 t80, and others. Hmm. Wait, does NT23 produce t69? Wait, perhaps I'm missing a production where a non-terminal produces t94. Or is there a possibility that I missed one?\n\nWait, perhaps t94 is part of some non-terminals. Let me look through. For instance, NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT8, but then NT9 \u2192 t15. No. Wait, let me think differently.\n\nIf I can't find a production that produces t94 as a terminal, then t94 must come from a non-terminal that can produce it. But in the provided grammar, do any non-terminals produce t94 as one of their productions? Let me go through each NT and their rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice some NS:\n\n- NT23: It has rules like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, etc., but I don't see any terminal.\n- NT5: It has NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8.\n- NT22: Only has t28.\n- NT25: NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11.\n- NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26, which is a recursive rule but eventually leads to terminals.\n- NT27: NT27 \u2192 other NTs.\n- NT28: NT28 \u2192 t80.\n- NT29: NT29 \u2192 t30 sometimes, etc.\n- NT6: \u2192t17.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some production for t94. Let me go through the entire structure again:\n\nLooking through all NTs, they all have productions of the form NT \u2192 two NTs or a terminal. Hmm, looking back, maybe I missed NT22 \u2192 't28', NT21\u2192t21, etc., but not t94. So perhaps there's no production that produces t94 as a terminal. Which means that the string cannot derive t94 unless it comes from a non-terminal that produces it.\n\nBut if I can't find any production where a non-terminal produces t94, then t94 cannot be part of any derived string, which would imply that the string starts with t94, which is impossible because there is no production to derive t94. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that's a bit fast"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It consists of rules where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. Each rule has the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I can see several rules, but some of them might be terminal rules now, as I notice that some rules are directly converted into terminals like 't49' or 't50'. Wait, no, looking closer, some rules are mixtures. For example, NT23 -> 't49' is a terminal, but others might be non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, most of the rules are non-terminals, but some of the right-hand sides (RHS) are either non-terminals or a mix. For instance, NT23 sometimes has productions like NT5 NT2, which are non-terminals. But in some places, there are productions like NT23 -> 't46'. So these are terminal rules, meaning NT23 can produce a terminal symbol directly.\n\nWait, wait, I need to make sure I parse the rules correctly. Each rule is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal. So if a rule is like A -> a, then A can produce that terminal a directly. \n\nSo in this grammar, many non-terminals have terminal productions, which means when they appear in a derivation, they can stop the process and produce a terminal symbol. \n\nGiven the string `t29 t86 t92 t91 t50 t47 t42 t29 t86 t1 t59 t94 t59 t91`, I need to check if this sequence can be produced by the grammar starting from S.\n\nI think the way to do this is to see if the string can be broken down into the symbols the grammar can produce. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces only non-terminals or a single terminal. So the process is to parse the string from the start symbol.\n\nI might use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not super familiar with it, but given that the grammar is in CNF, the CYK algorithm should work efficiently. Alternatively, since the string is fairly long, maybe around 14 symbols, I could attempt a recursive descent approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the grammar has a limited number of productions, so maybe I can construct a parse tree step by step. Let me see.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps certain symbols are terminals that must appear as leaves in the parse tree. So each step can only introduce non-terminals, except in the last step when terminals are produced.\n\nWait, but wait, the grammar may not have every symbol as a terminal. Some may remain as non-terminals, meaning that certain t's in the string would have to correspond to terminal symbols allowed by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string should be split into a series of substitutions. But I think the key is to look at the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the given grammar, the only non-terminals that produce terminals are those that have a rule ending with a terminal. For example, NT23 -> 't49'; similarly, NT5 -> 't26' and others.\n\nBut in the string, I see many t's like t29, t86, etc. So these t symbols are meant to be generated by the grammar. So in the grammar, these terminals are generated by certain non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps t29 is given by some non-terminal. Let me check the grammar for any rules where the RHS is two non-terminals and the result is producing, say, t29.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, checking for any rules where the RHS is two non-terminals, and perhaps one of them is a terminal. Wait, no. Wait, no, all rules in CNF have either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the RHS. So in the grammar, the only way a non-terminal can produce a terminal is directly via a rule like A->a.\n\nBut the other productions are like A->BC. So for a string to contain a terminal, it must be the direct result of a production step.\n\nTherefore, the given string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be produced by the grammar through a direct production.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first symbol is t29. So t29 is a terminal, so in the grammar, there must be a rule where some non-terminal can produce t29 as a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, do any rules have \"t29\" as the RHS? Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nYes, I see that NT23 is sometimes replaced by t49, and t29 is mentioned in some rules, like NT8 -> t91, which is a terminal, and others.\n\nWait, perhaps checking all rules to see if any non-terminal has a terminal t29 as their production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT24 -> t42\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking at the list, I see a rule:\n\nLooking at the top of the list, the first few rules are S's productions, like S->NT23 NT24 NT5 etc. Wait, no, S is a non-terminal, and the rules for S are productions like S-> NT23 NT24 NT5. Wait, no, in the grammar, the first three rules under S have three non-terminals on the RHS? Or wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me parse the grammar rules correctly.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, but looking more carefully, some are written as S -> NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three non-terminals. That can't be right, because Chomsky normal form only allows productions with either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, that must be a mistake. Because in the given grammar, under S, there are three rules each with three non-terminals on the RHS, which violates Chomsky normal form. Because Chomsky normal form requires that each production is either A->BC (two non-terminals) or A->a (a single terminal). So the provided grammar probably has a typo or mistake in it.\n\nWait, but the user presented the grammar, so perhaps the example rules are not all of the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar lines.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe first few lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nBut that's three non-terminals on the RHS. Then:\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nThat's two non-terminals.\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nTwo non-terminals.\n\nThen S -> NT20 NT6, two.\n\nSo the initial assumption might be incorrect. It seems that some rules under S actually have three non-terminals, which would mean the grammar is written in a different form, perhaps with more than two non-terminals on RHS, which would not be context-free normal form.\n\nBut the user specified it's in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps this is a mistake, but to proceed, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that perhaps those rules are incorrect, or perhaps the '...' indicates more productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial lines of the grammar were mistyped, and the actual structure is that each production is A->BC or A->a.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this, perhaps I should focus on those rules where the RHS is two non-terminals, as the provided string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be directly produced by a production step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each step produces one non-terminal, and the string's length must match the number of steps.\n\nWait, for CFG in CNF, the derivation can be recursive: each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the length of the string increases by one each time a production is applied.\n\nWait, starting from S (a single non-terminal), each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. So for a string of length n, the number of steps needed is (n -1). So the total number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of productions minus one.\n\nThe given string has 14 symbols (t's), so the number of productions would be 13 steps. Hmm, but S starts as one, then each step adds one. So to get 14 symbols, S must undergo 13 productions, but that's possible.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case here because the string could also involve multiple non-terminals being replaced in parallel.

Looking at the provided grammar, it seems all the productions are in CNF, which is good because it makes parsing or generating strings a bit easier.\n\nThe string starts with `t26`, `t86`, etc. I know in CNF, the start symbol S will expand into a sequence of non-terminals, and those can expand into terminals. Each production is binary, so each expansion step reduces the count of non-terminals by one.\n\nI think the string consists of 15 `t` followed by numbers, like `t26 t86...`. These are probably terminals. So perhaps each `tX` represents a production that ends in a terminal, and the numbers are part of the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and see if there are any `t` productions.

So the string is effectively 15 symbols, each `tX` where X varies.\n\nTo determine if the grammar can produce this string, I can model it as a leftmost derivation or rightmost, building the string step by step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should be one more than the number of non-terminals in the leftmost derivation, because each step adds a terminal and reduces non-terminals by one. But the string has 15 symbols, which suggests that the derivation would have 15-14=1? No, wait, the number of productions should be length-1, so the string length is n, and the number of productions is n-1. So a string of 15 symbols would require 14 steps.\n\nBut maybe looking at the possible terminals and how they are produced. Let me check the grammar for rules that produce `tX` terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21' (wait, that might not be a terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't69'\n- NT19 -> 't69'\n- NT8 -> 't99' (assuming NT8 produces 't18', but wait, looking at the rules: NT8 -> 't91'? Or does it produce 't18'? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT28\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT8\n- Also, NT26 -> 't86'\n- Wait, no, NT30 -> 't86'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't17 NT3'\n- NT28 -> 't80 NT18'\n- NT12 -> 't29 NT9'\n- NT26 -> 't23 NT23'\n- NT23 -> 't69 NT0 NT2'\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, I might have misread it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more straightforward to map each 'tX' to a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at all the rules, the terminal symbols are the ones with 't' followed by a number, like 't49', 't50', 't26', etc. So for example, 't26' is a terminal.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is `t26`. Looking at the grammar, where is `t26` produced?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28' (but 't28' is a terminal?)\nWait, no, 't28' is a terminal, but in the rules, it's NT22 -> 't28'?\n\nWait no, looking at the rules, the productions end with some NT expressions or terminals.\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't26' appears in the rule: NT5 -> 't26'\n\nSo to produce `t26`, we can have a rule that directly outputs it.\n\nSimilarly, looking for all the t's in the string: `t26`, `t86`, etc.\n\nSo let me list the tX in the string:\n\nt26, t86, t78, t69, t91, t42, t29, t78, t82, t26, t97, t82, t94, t26, t42.\n\nNow, I can look up in the grammar which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- t26: NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- t86: NT23 \u2192 't86'? Or wait, wait. Looking at the rules:\n\nI need to find each tX and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t49: from NT23 \u2192 't49'\n- t50: from NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- t26: from NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- What about t86? Looking for a rule where a non-terminal produces 't86', but from the rules, looking for a rule that ends with 't86'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- I see NT23 \u2192 't86' in one of the rules.\n\nWait, no, in the given rules, it's:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nWait, but earlier in the user's message, the rules might have been cut off.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I notice:\n\n\"NT23 -> 't49'\"\n\nWait, no, actually, the rules seem to have some rules ending in 'tX's.\n\nWait, the user provided a very long list, but perhaps it's better to methodically go through each tX and see if it's produced by a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this as a parse tree or simulate the derivation.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to note that for the string to be generated, each `tX` must be the result of a production step in the grammar.\n\nSo, for instance, each 't' in the string must correspond directly to a production rule where a non-terminal directly expands into that terminal.\n\nMoreover, the length of the string is 15 symbols, so the derivation must consist of 15 steps, each appending a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production is binary, so starting from S, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by 1. So the number of steps is equal to the number of non-terminals in the leftmost derivation, which for a string of length n would require n-1 steps.\n\nBut in any case, the string is 15 symbols, which suggests that there are 14 production steps, each producing a terminal and reducing the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nNow, looking back at the string, perhaps the first symbol is t26, which is produced by NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n\nSo, the leftmost derivation would start with S \u2192 ... (some expansion of S) leading to t26 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the start symbol S can expand into a sequence that eventually produces these t's.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for each tX whether there's a non-terminal NT that can produce it directly.\n\nSo, let's go through each `tX` in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, I remember that to check if a string is generated by a grammar, I can use a parsing method like the CYK algorithm. However, since the string starts with t62, t94, etc., and the rules involve non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals, I might need to work backwards from the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the string without the spaces: t62 t94 t91 t29 t18 t78 t26 t50 t62 t18 t50 t1 t80 t94. It looks like the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be matched by a production rule in the grammar. \n\nI start by checking the first few terminals. The first symbol is t62. Looking at the production rules, t62 seems to come from NT2 => 't62', which is one of the terminals defined by NT2. Wait, no, actually in the provided rules, NT2 is defined, but the terminal symbols are things like 't49', 't50', etc. Looking at the productions, some of the right-hand sides are terminals like t49, t50, t74, etc. \n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar, certain non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't49'. But in the given string, I don't see 't49' yet. Instead, I see t62, t94, t80, etc. So, perhaps I should check if these terminals are present in the productions.\n\nLet me scan through the grammar rules to find any productions that result in t62, t94, t80, t91, etc. \n\nLooking up NT2 in the rules, I see: \n- NT2 -> 't62'\nSo, that means t62 comes directly from NT2. Similarly, checking other terminals:\n- t94 comes from NT2 \u2192 't94' (from the rule NT2 \u2192 't94')\n- t80 comes from NT20 \u2192 't80'\n- t91 from NT28 \u2192 't91', etc.\n\nSo, each symbol in the string is either a direct terminal or can be derived from a non-terminal. The idea is to see if starting from S, we can apply the productions to get the string.\n\nBut with a string of 14 symbols, it's a bit long, so I should think about how the grammar parses it. Each production rule in CNF allows looking at two symbols at a time, so the string length should be a power of two plus or minus one, but 14 is not 2^n-1 or 2^n. Hmm, but maybe because this is a CNF grammar, it can generate any string, or perhaps not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by some production from the grammar, starting from S. Since it's CNF, each non-terminal can produce two symbols, which must match the next two symbols in the string. However, since we're given terminals directly, perhaps we need to find a way to parse them back into the grammar.\n\nWait, another way is to construct the parse tree. Starting from the string, trying to find which production rules can generate these sequences.\n\nBut with a string of 14 symbols, and considering the grammar, it's quite possible that it's complex. Maybe I should check each terminal in the string to see if they correspond to any direct productions or can be broken down further.\n\nLet's list each symbol and see where they come from:\n- t62: comes from NT2\n- t94: comes from NT2\n- t91: comes from NT28 \u2192 't91'\n- t29: from NT23 \u2192 't29'\n- t18: from NT26 \u2192 't18'\n- t78: from NT24 \u2192 't78' (since NT24 \u2192 't1' is not t78. Wait, looking again, NT24 \u2192 't1' is one of the rules. Wait, no, let's check the rules correctly. Wait, no, actually in the provided rules, some have 't' followed by a number, like t49, t50, etc. For example, looking for t78:\n\nLooking at the rules, is there a production that results in t78? Let's check. Scanning through:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (since NT5 \u2192 't26')? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. In the productions, for example, \"NT23 -> 't49'\". So, each terminal is like 't' followed by a number. So, for t78, we need a production where a non-terminal directly produces it. Wait, checking all the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal produces 't78'. It seems that none of the rules directly produce 't78' except for NT24 \u2192 't1', which is not. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, the rules include things like NT24 \u2192 't1', but not 't78'. So, t78 must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't78' via multiple steps. Wait, looking further, perhaps a non-terminal that can produce 't78' eventually.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't1'. Then, where does t1 come from? Let me check the rules for t1. Scanning through, I don't see any production that directly results in t1 except for NT23 \u2192 't49', which is 't49', not t1. Wait, no, actually, looking again, I think I might be mixing numbers.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For example, in the rules, we have:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- Other rules for NT23, etc. \n\nBut I'm not noticing 't78' being directly produced by any rule. So perhaps I need to see if 't78' can be produced through multiple steps. For example, does any non-terminal produce another non-terminal that eventually produces 't78'? \n\nLooking for a path where a non-terminal A can produce a sequence of symbols ending with 't78'. Let's see if any of the rules can produce 't78' as part of a chain.\n\nWait, in the rules, we see NT24 \u2192 't1', and NT26 \u2192 't19', but not 't78'. Looking elsewhere, for example, NT23 \u2192 't49', which is 't49', so that doesn't help. Let me check NT28 \u2192 't91', so that's 't91'. Maybe elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken in directly looking for 't78'. Maybe 't78' is a result of a non-terminal that can be reached via a chain of productions. For example, can any non-terminal produce 'AB', where A is the next symbol and B is 't78'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't78' can be part of a larger production. Wait, in the rules, for example, some non-terminals produce sequences of non-terminals that eventually translate to terminals. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9. So, if NT23 can produce 'something' and NT9 can produce 't78', then maybe NT28 can produce a string ending with 't78'. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the string step by step, trying to match the terminals with rules.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S. S has several productions, e.g., S \u2192 NT23 NT5, etc. So each S production splits into two non-terminals. Then, each of those can be further split into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is 14 symbols, perhaps it's important to see if the length allows a valid parse tree. In Chomsky Normal Form, the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of productions to derive the string. Wait, no, in CNF, each production applies to a single non-terminal, but in this case, each step doubles the number of symbols.

Each production rule is either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminals.

Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT symbols are non-terminals that produce other non-terminals, which in turn may produce terminals like t49, t1, t80, etc. So the string to evaluate consists of all these t symbols. The non-terminals in the grammar can be expanded into sequences of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nI need to see if the string can be a complete expansion of S. To do this, I can try to parse the string by matching substrings that match the productions.\n\nLet me look at the string step by step:\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT17 NT3, etc. Wait, but looking at the string, it's a series of terminals, but I need to find a way to derive all of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a sequence of non-terminals that, when expanded, produce the string. So, starting from S, which can expand into various NT combinations, and each of those NTs expand into other NTs or terminals.\n\nLet me first see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, we have:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT23 \u2192 't23' or other combinations\n- NT30 \u2192 't30' (but in the string we have t86, t80, etc.)\nWait, no, actually, some of the productions end with 't's, like:\n\nLooking more carefully, some non-terminals produce 't' with a number.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50';\n\nNT23 \u2192 't23';\n\nWait, but in the string, I have t50, t86, etc. Looking at the rules provided, let me check which NTs produce which t's.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' (so NT15 can directly produce t50)\n- NT23 \u2192 't23' (but in the string, I have t86, t18, etc. Hmm, maybe not. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no. Actually, other non-terminals produce multiple terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT25. But some of these NTs produce t's directly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better if I list out which terminal symbols correspond to which NTs. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, some non-terminals produce 't' with a number:\n\nLooking at all rules, the ones that end with 't' are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT23 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't30' (appears twice)\n- Wait, checking the provided rules, I notice:\n\nLooking for 't' cases:\n\nWait, the rules are quite long.

{"custom_id":"request-296","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of tokens like t69, t42, etc. The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in Chomsky normal form has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, I should probably check if the grammar's terminals match the string. But looking at the grammar, I see that some rule productions end with a terminal string, like NT19 \u2192 NT6 NT19 or NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11. Wait, no, actually, looking more closely, some of them like NT25 -> NT30 NT11, which seems to go into other NT symbols and it might eventually produce a 't' symbol. For example, NT25 produces NT30, which in another production becomes 't11', and NT11 might produce 't62' or something. Hmm, but I'm not sure, maybe I should focus on the string given.\n\nThe string is `t69 t42 t50 t74 t26 t59 t59 t28 t91 t1 t59 t78 t69 t91 t49 t26`. That's 16 tokens. That's a long string, but the grammar's structure might help determine if it can produce this.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, I notice that some symbols directly produce 't' symbols. For example, NT23 \u2192 nt8 NT16, but also looking deeper, NT23 can produce NT27 NT16, and NT27 can produce NT4 NT26. Hmm, but in the end, these NT rules produce other NTs until they reach a terminal. Alternatively, some NTs directly produce 't' symbols. Looking at the last rule, NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, and NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT8, but NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28, and NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27. This seems like a recursive loop with some 't's. Wait, maybe I should make a list of all the production rules that lead directly to 't's.\n\nWait, actually, the rules like NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11 might end up with NTs that produce 't's. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT8, and NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11. Hmm, but maybe that's not leading anywhere. Alternatively, looking for symbols that directly produce 't's. Wait, in the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 nt24 NT6, and elsewhere, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which in turn might produce 't's. This is getting a bit messy. Maybe I should try to find a way to parse the string backward, which is often easier for such problems.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should check if all the tokens in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals. Looking at the string tokens, they range from t49 up to t94 and t97, which are probably specific production rules.\n\nWait, let's look at the list of production rules. For example, NT23 -> NT5 NT25. Then NT25 -> NT30 NT11, NT30 and NT11 might eventually produce 't's. Similarly, NT27 is sometimes involved, like NT7 -> NT24 NT6, and NT24 might lead to 't's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should start from the string and try to match it backward, looking for whether the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t69 t42 t50 t74 t26 t59 t59 t28 t91 t1 t59 t78 t69 t91 t49 t26.\n\nLet me split it into individual tokens: [t69, t42, t50, t74, t26, t59, t59, t28, t91, t1, t59, t78, t69, t91, t49, t26].\n\nNow, I can try to see if each token can be produced by the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t69. Looking at the rules, where does t69 come from? NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16? Wait, no. Looking at the rules, the last production is NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11. Wait, no, I'm looking for 't69' in the terminals, so I need to find the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nLooking back, I see some productions leading to terminals. For example, NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26, but that's two non-terminals. NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT23, which isn't a terminal. Continuing, NT19 -> NT29 NT29, which isn't a terminal. Wait, perhaps some higher-level productions lead to terminals, or maybe certain NTs directly produce 't's.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, maybe NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11. Then NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT8, and NT11 \u2192 NT18 NT16. Hmm, not seeing a terminal yet. Wait, NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6, and NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which is another NT. Hmm. Or NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17, which is still an NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Looking for any rule that produces a single terminal. Let's see. Oh, I don't see any rules that directly produce a single terminal symbol. All the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or other combinations. Wait, that might be a problem because if the grammar doesn't have any productions that directly produce terminals, then it can't generate any terminal strings, only other non-terminals. But that can't be right, because we have 't's in the string, which are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Looking again, some rules like NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, but others like NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17. Wait, perhaps some NT symbols produce terminal strings when combined.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' in the string corresponds to a two-step production. For example, the production NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6, then NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which might produce 't's in some way. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me instead try to see if the string can be built starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S can produce various sequences, like NT23 NT24 NT5 or NT20 NT16. But looking at the start symbol S, the productions all start with NT23, NT20, etc., leading into other NTs and terminals. \n\nWait, perhaps the string should have an even number of elements because each NT production leads to two symbols, but it's a context-free grammar, so each production either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string has 16 tokens, which is even, so maybe each production corresponds to one step in the string. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if the string can be generated by looking for the possible paths in the grammar. The string starts with t69. So, perhaps t69 is the result of some NT producing 't69'. But looking at the rules, no NT directly produces 't69'. Wait, then perhaps it's via a chain of productions. So, for example, some NT leads to 't69' via other NTs.\n\nWait, let's check which NT symbols can produce 't's. For example, looking for rules where a terminal is on the RHS, but I'm not seeing any rules that directly produce single terminals except perhaps from some combinations.\n\nWait, looking back, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6. Then, if NT24 leads to 't's and NT6 leads to 't's, perhaps NT7 can produce a sequence of 't's. Alternatively, some NT's produce 't's indirectly.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to use the given grammar to see if the string can be generated. Since I need to focus on the end of the problem, where I'm supposed to process this step-by-step, let me try to find if each token in the string can be produced by some NT production.\n\nWait, let's list the tokens and see if each can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT23 NT24 NT5 or similar. So, for the string to be generated, the sequence must start with something that S produces, which in this case, looking at the given string, the first token is t69."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, let me parse the productions to find all terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT23 -> t59\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT9 -> t78\n- NT11 -> t18\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t80\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT4 -> t8\n- NT28 -> t42\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT23 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT6 -> t17\n- NT28 -> t23\n- NT4 -> t23\n- NT4 -> t29\n- NT3 -> t19\n- NT4 -> t18\n- NT10 -> t27\n- NT15 -> t23\n- NT23 -> t27\n- NT14 -> t21\n- NT20 -> t29\n- NT15 -> t26\n- NT23 -> t16\n- NT17 -> t19\n- NT17 -> t16\n- NT28 -> t24\n- NT12 -> t25\n- NT21 -> t10\n- NT23 -> t42\nHmm, I might have missed some, but I noticed that NT28 -> t42 is one of the rules. So t42 is derived from NT28. So the first symbol in the string, t42, must come from a production of NT28. Let's note that.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t42, followed by t18, t23, t82, t28, t28, t21, and so on. So the entire string is a series of terminals, and I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t42, which is the result of NT28 -> t42. So after that, the next symbol is t18. So looking at the grammar, what does NT18 produce? From the given productions, I see NT18 -> t92. But t92 is a terminal, so if the grammar allows NT18 to produce t92, then the next symbol should be t92, but the string has t18 next. That's a problem because t18 is a terminal, not t92.\n\nWait, let me confirm the productions for NT18. Looking back, I see NT18 -> t92. So NT18 can only produce t92, not t18. So if the string after t42 is t18, that can't be generated by NT18. So maybe I made a mistake in looking up NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT18 with NT0 or another non-terminal. Let me check again. The productions given include:\n\nNT18 -> t92\n\nSo NT18 can only produce t92, not t18. So the second symbol in the string is t18, which can't be produced by NT18. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because there's a mismatch at the second symbol.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The string is t42 t18 t23 t82 t28 t28 t21 t78 t80 t29 t97 t69 t97 t78 t74 t86 t82.\n\nSo position 1: t42 (from NT28)\n\nPosition 2: t18 (which needs to be produced by some NT rule)\n\nLooking at the grammar, is there an NT that produces t18? Let's search through the productions:\n\nLooking back, NT28 is one of the non-terminals in the productions. Wait, no, in this grammar, NT18 is a separate non-terminal. The only rule that includes t18 is the production of NT18 -> t92.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me find all rules that produce t18. Looking through:\n\nWait, the string starts with t42, which comes from NT28, then t18. Looking at the grammar, I see NT18 -> t92, so NT18 produces t92. There's another rule, NT21 -> t10 but that's not relevant. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT21 with t10, but that's not the case. Let me look for t18.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Maybe t18 is not a terminal at all. Looking at the grammar, all the terminals are of the form 'tXX' where XX is a two-digit number. So 't18' is a terminal if it's present in the productions. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> t42\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT15 -> t50\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t80\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT28 -> t23\n- NT4 -> t8\n- NT18 -> t15\nWait, no, maybe I'm looking at a partial list. Let me recount:\n\nWait, actually, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> t42\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t80\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT3 -> t1\n- nt21 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The first symbol is t42, which comes from NT28. Then the next symbol is t18. So where can t18 come from? Looking again, I see that NT18 can produce both t92 and t15. Wait, let me check the exact production rules for NT18.\n\nLooking back, the productions include:\n\nNT18 -> t92\n\nand\n\nNT18 -> t15\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT18 -> t15\nWait, is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-317","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is composed of tokens (like t29, t74, etc.), and the grammar consists of a series of productions. \n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. It's important because many parsing algorithms are based on CNF, but more importantly for me, the structure of the grammar will help me in analyzing the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to be in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 is correct because it's a non-terminal producing two non-terminals. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 is in CNF because it's producing two non-terminals. However, I notice some of the rules are ending with a terminal symbol, which might complicate things. Wait, if the production ends with an a, does that mean it's part of the process? Or maybe these are terminals. I remember that in CNF, the final productions should produce terminals, so perhaps these rules are the ones generating the actual symbols. \n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t29 t74 t21 t94 t26 t21 t80 t28 t29 t1 t92 t47 t97 t80 t86 t50 t94`. Each token represents a terminal symbol. The fact that each token ends with 't' and a number suggests that the grammar might be using numbers to represent different variables or symbols. \n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT23 \u2192 't49', which suggests that certain non-terminals produce single terminal symbols like 't49'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce other terminals. However, the string I'm given has many different t's (like t29, t74, etc.), but I don't see any rules that produce, say, 't29' directly. That's a red flag. If the string contains a token that isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string:\nt29, t74, t21, t94, t26, t21, t80, t28, t29, t1, t92, t47, t97, t80, t86, t50, t94.\n\nI need to check each token to see if it's a terminal that appears on the right-hand side (RHS) of any production rule. Let's go through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the production rules, some produce a single terminal. For example:\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82' (Wait, does that mean 't82' is a terminal and NT7 can produce it?)\nWait, looking at NT7 \u2192 't82', so NT7 can produce the terminal 't82'. Similarly, other non-terminals may produce other terminals.\n\nBut does the string contain any 't' that's beyond what's defined in the productions? Let's see. For instance, t74, t21, t94, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't49', so 't49' is a terminal. But what about t74? In the given grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal produces 't74'. Let me scan through all the rules again.\n\nLooking again, the only terminals are like t49, t50, t1, t47, etc. I don't see any production that has 't74' on the RHS. For example, does any of the NT rules produce 't74'? Looking at the list, I don't see that.\n\nSo 't74' is in the string, but there's no production that generates it. That means the string includes a terminal symbol that's not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, unless I've missed some production. Let me check all the rules carefully. The rules provided are a long list, but I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces 't74'. So, yeah, 't74' is definitely a problem.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string contains a symbol that isn't covered by any production in the grammar, so the string isn't in the language generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a token 't74' which is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-332","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I have to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar. \n\nFirst, let me understand what the grammar looks like. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT23, NT0, etc.) is rewritten into either two other non-terminals or a terminal (like 'tX'). The string provided is: `t59 t21 t1 t49 t80 t62 t28 t1 t97 t80 t74 t80 t69 t21 t94 t21 t69 t92`. \n\nI notice that the grammar has both non-terminals and some terminals. My first step is to look at each production rule and see how they can be used to derive the string. Since the string consists solely of terminals, the goal is to trace back from the start symbol S and see if expanding the non-terminals step by step can lead to exactly this sequence.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar has four production rules for S. Let me list them:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 \n2. S -> NT20 NT16 \n3. S -> NT17 NT3 \n4. S -> NT20 NT6 \n\nI'll probably need to eliminate S by expanding one of these rules, so I need to find which of these can lead to the given string. Let's break down each option.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT23 NT24\n- Then we need to expand NT23 and NT24.\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 has two productions:\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT26\n- NT23 -> NT23 NT21 \n\nI think the first one is a base case because NT23 appears on both sides, making it a recursive production. Let's consider expanding NT23 -> NT5 NT26.\n\nNT5 has two productions:\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT22 NT4\n\nWait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for matching terminals in the string to see if they can be generated by some rules.\n\nThe string starts with t59 t21 t1 t49..., which means I suspect the first tokens must come from NT23's expansion. Let me check NT23's possible expansions.\n\nFrom NT23, the first option is NT5 NT26. Let's see NT5 and NT26:\n\nNT5 has options:\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT8\n- NT5 -> NT22 NT4\n\nNT26 has four options:\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT19\n- NT26 -> NT4 NT29\n- NT26 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNone of these directly produce t59 or t21. Wait, but let me check NT15 since it's another non-terminal. NT15 has one production:\n- NT15 -> NT2 NT8\n\nSo NT15 can produce the terminal 't2' because looking at NT8's options:\n- NT8 can produce 't91' directly (one production is 't91'), and another option is NT28 -> NT8 NT23, which might complicate things.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that the string is quite long, and each symbol must be matched by a production. Each production step increases the number of symbols, so to reach the given string, the depth of derivation must be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, using the CYK algorithm might be a systematic way, but since I'm working manually, perhaps I can look for how the string's tokens can fit into the grammar's structure.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t59, t21, t1, t49, etc.\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules:\n\n- t49 is produced by NT2 (since 't2' is the terminal, but wait no, wait NT2's production is NT26 NT19, not NT2 itself. Or is it? Wait the grammar's terminal symbols are any with a rule that end with the terminal. So, looking for terminal symbols:\n\nFrom the grammar's productions, I can see many 'tX' as terminals. For example:\n- NT23 -> 't49' (I see a line: NT23 -> 't49', which is a terminal)\n- Similarly, NT5 -> 't26', etc.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some of the productions end with 'tX', like:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n\nSo those are terminals. So whenever a production like NT23 -> 't49' occurs, that produces just 't49' as the terminal symbol.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals are like 't21', 't1', etc.\n\nSo the string includes t59, t21, t1, t49, t80, t62, etc. So perhaps some of these can be produced by specific rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t59. So I need to see which non-terminal can produce t59.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any non-terminals produce t59? Let's look for any productions that result in 't59'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example, NT20 -> NT17 NT8. NT17 -> NT19 NT2, and NT19 -> NT6 NT19 or NT19 -> NT29 NT29. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the production NT20 -> 't97' is there (looking at the grammar rules: NT20 -> 't97'), so that's a terminal.\n\nBut t59 is a terminal. Looking where else can I find 't59'. Let's check each production:\n\n1. NT1 -> 't94'\n2. NT7 -> 't82'\n3. NT26 -> 't69' (but wait, NT26 is a non-terminal, but some of its productions can produce terminals. Let me check.\n\nWait, NT26 has several rules, and one of them is NT26 -> NT8 NT26. That can't be a terminal. Another is NT26 -> NT8 NT19, which also includes NT19.\n\nWait, another production: NT26 -> NT2 NT19. That also seems to produce non-terminals. So perhaps 't59' is produced directly by a production of NT20 -> 't97' or other tokens.\n\nWait, looking for where 't59' is a production.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, the only explicit terminals are where non-terminals expand directly into a single 't' symbol. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT23: 't49' (produced)\n- NT15: 't50' (produced)\n- NT2: 't94' (produced)\n- NT21: 't21' (produced)\n- NT8: 't91' (produced)\n- NT20: 't97' (produced)\n- NT18: 't92' (produced)\n- NT12: 't29' (produced)\n- NT26: 't69' (produced)\n- NT30: 't86' (produced)\n- Others like NT7, NT9, etc., do they produce terminals?\n\nWait, checking each production:\n\nWait, for example, NT23 is a non-terminal. NT23 has two productions:\n1. NT23 -> NT5 NT26\n2. NT23 -> NT23 NT21\n\nWhich of these can produce t59? It seems that neither of these direct expansions produce a t, but some of their expansions do. So perhaps t59 is produced indirectly through some derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps t59 is a terminal symbol, but there's no production for NT23 or other non-terminals to produce t59 directly. So that would mean the grammar cannot produce t59, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but in the grammar rules, I don't see any production that results in 't59'. Let's list out all the tX terminals to see which are present.\n\nFrom the grammar lines that result in terminals:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-335","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t49 t74 t74 t23 t69 t86 t91 t97 t18 t29 t18 t49 t29 t78 t18 t23 t86`, and there's a lot of NT rules, but I notice that many of them seem to have 't' followed by numbers, like 't49', 't74', etc. I'm not sure if that indicates terminals or not, but I think in a typical grammar, terminals are leaves, not part of the variables (NTs). But here, some of them are written as 't...', so maybe those are terminals, and the rest are variables.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, variables start with NT, but sometimes they transition into terminals. For example, I see rules like NT7 -> 't82', so that's a terminal. So in the grammar, variables are on the left, and some rules might reduce to terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, it's a sequence of tokens ending with 't...' possibly, but I'm not sure if these are all terminals or not. However, considering that variables are on the left, maybe the string consists of variables and terminals. But the string is given as `t49 t74 t29 t23 t69 t74 t91 t97 t18 t29 t18 t49 t29 t78 t18 t23 t86`. It seems like all of these are 't' followed by numbers. So maybe in the grammar, all variables are on the left, and these 't...' are terminals that the variables can reduce into, perhaps.\n\nHmm, but in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), grammars only have two symbols on the right side of the production: a variable and a terminal, or two variables. terminals are represented by specific symbols, so in the given grammar, the actual terminals would be those with rules that directly produce them. For example, in the grammar, some rules produce 't...', but wait, looking carefully, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't82', so 't82' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 -> 't50', another terminal. But most rules don't produce terminals; instead, variables produce other variables until a terminal is reached. So in the given grammar, variables can produce terminals, but in this case, many of those are not in the list where variables produce terminals directly. Wait, the grammar seems a bit confusing because many rules mention 't...' but in the code provided, I see lines like NT7 -> 't82', meaning that NT7 can produce 't82'. But other rules, like S -> NT23 NT24, mean that S can be replaced by NT23 and NT24, which are variables.\n\nSo, the string is made up of a sequence of terminal symbols, each like 't49', 't74', etc. To determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation path that leads to this sequence starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the grammar, S has several productions:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\nWait, no, let me check again. The grammar as given has:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar, the first line is S -> NT23 NT24 NT5. Or is that correct? Wait, the user input shows:\n\nGrammar: ```S -> NT23 NT24 NT5? Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait, in the user's message, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, it seems that the first line is:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5? Or wait, looking back:\n\nThe first lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nWait, now I'm confused because the S productions appear in the first few lines.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the grammar correctly. Let me try to list all the productions:\n\nLooking at the user's input, the grammar is written with each production as \"S -> NT23 NT24\", etc. So the first few S productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo each line starts with S ->, followed by two NTs, which are variables. So S can produce combinations of these NTs. Since this is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, except when a variable can produce a terminal directly. Wait, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that ends with a single terminal; instead, all non-terminals expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait a second, but the user includes some rules that end with 't...', like NT7 -> 't82'. So those would be terminals, which are single tokens.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can only expand into two non-terminals. So the derivation of the string will require branching, but since the string is a sequence of 17 tokens, each step must add one token, which would require exactly 16 steps if starting from S (each step combines two non-terminals, so each application doubles the number of symbols, but that's not the case here). Wait, that approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string consists of a sequence produced by a leftmost derivation, where each step appends a terminal symbol. But since the grammar is in CNF, the only way to produce a terminal is through a production that includes a terminal on the right-hand side, like A -> a B, where a is a terminal. Then, to produce a string, you must derive a terminal followed by other symbols.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A->BC, A->B, or A->t, where t is a terminal.\n\nSo, in this grammar, the NT rules can be either variables (like NT23, NT15, etc.) or terminals (like 't49', 't74', etc.).\n\nIn the given grammar, I can see that sometimes the rules produce terminals, but given the structure, I might want to identify which NTs are terminals and which are variables. terminals would be the ones that reduce directly to the 't' sequences, like 't49', 't74', etc.\n\nSo, for example, the rule NT7 -> 't82' means that the variable NT7 can produce the terminal 't82', so 't82' is a leaf in any parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t49`, which would need to come from a production where the NT for that position is 't49'. So I need to trace back in the grammar to see which variable can derive to `t49`.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to construct the parse tree step by step, starting from S and trying to build up the string.\n\nLet's see, the string is: t49 t74 t29 t23 t69 t49 t29 t78 t18 t29 t18 t49 t29 t78 t18 t23 t86.\n\nSo, the string starts with t49, then t74, etc. So each token must come from a production of the NT at that position.\n\nFirst, the first token is `t49`. So the first NT in S's production must be something that can derive to `t49`. Looking through the grammar, I see that some variables have rules producing 't...' so I can check which variable's rule might produce `t49`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\n- NT2 -> 't62'\n\n- NT1 -> 't30'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go through each NT and see which can produce any of the 't's in the string.\n\nBut maybe it's better to see from the end, working backwards. The last token is `t86`. So the last NT in the string must be something that produces `t86`. Looking through the NT rules, I don't see any NT that directly produce `t86`. So perhaps `t86` is built from multiple steps. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding, and the string is a concatenation of the terminals that result from expanding the S production.\n\nWait, but since the string consists only of terminal symbols, the entire derivation must produce that string directly, without any non-terminals left. So each step must produce a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Because in CNF, each production produces two non-terminals, which would then have to be expanded further, unless a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly. So in order to reach the string consisting only of terminals, there must be a way for a chain of"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-345","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces: `t29, t26, t80, t49, t91, t49, t86, t69, t26, t92, t29, t94, t92, t1, t69, t42, t69, t97, t29`. \n\nFirst, I notice that all the symbols in the string look like terminal symbols since they end with 't' followed by a number. In a context-free grammar, non-terminals expand into other symbols, either terminals or other non-terminals. So, if every symbol in the string is a terminal, the string must be a result of fully expanding all non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, most of them seem to have on the left-hand side a non-terminal, like S, NT23, etc., and on the right-hand side, they have combinations of non-terminals (NTx) and terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar, most rules have combinations like NTx -> NTy NTz, but some have a mix, like S -> NT23 NT5. Also, some rules have a terminal on the right side, like NT7 -> NT24 NT6, but wait, is '6' a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal symbol?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT1 -> NT0 NT3\n\nNT29 -> NT29 NT30\n\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\n\nLooking further, the terminals seem to be symbols starting with 't', but I'm not 100% sure because the non-terminals might have 't' in them as well, but the rules don't show any non-terminals containing 't's except in the RHS of the last rules where some have 't's like NT7 \u2192 't82', etc.\n\nSo, maybe all the terminals are those 'tNt' where N is a digit, and the non-terminals are all the other NT... symbols.\n\nIn the string provided, all elements are of the form 'tnum', so they must be terminals. So the string must be a sequence of symbols generated by replacing all non-terminals with terminals. \n\nBut the string has 19 symbols. Let me count the number of symbols in the string: 19. So the string is a sequence of 19 terminal symbols.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production has two non-terminals on the right side. But wait, looking at the provided grammar, some rules have three symbols on the RHS, like S is defined as NT23 NT5, which are both non-terminals. Wait, no, that's not possible because in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So if any production has more than two non-terminals, it's not CNF, unless I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the given grammar. Looking through the rules, I see that some have two non-terminals and a terminal, like NT23 -> NT6 NT9: that's two non-terminals. Others have two non-terminals without any terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT5, which are non-terminals. Wait, but then that's a production where the right side has two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF because CNF allows productions like A \u2192 BC, B and C being non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some rules have a mix, like NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, in this grammar, the productions are either non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut, the key is that every symbol in the string is a terminal. So, to generate the string, every 't' must be produced by some terminal production.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, I can see that some non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nNT6 -> 't17'\n\nWait, no:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT2 -> 't47'\n\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nNT4 -> 't22'\n\nNT20 -> 't97'\n\nNT18 -> 't92'\n\nNT12 -> 't29'\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\n\nNT30 -> 't80'\n\nNT7 -> 't82'\n\nNT28 -> 't80'\n\nNT24 -> 't1'\n\nNT2 -> 't94'\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\nNT2 is defined as 't47'\n\nNT5 is defined as 't26'\n\nSimilarly, NT20 is 't97'\n\nNT18 is 't92'\n\nNT12 is 't29'\n\nNT26 is 't69'\n\nNT30 is 't80'\n\nNT7 is 't82'\n\nNT28 is 't80'\n\nNT24 is 't1'\n\nNT2 is 't94'\n\nNT5 is 't26'\n\nNT22 is 't28'\n\nNT20 is 't97'\n\nSo, the terminals are 't1', 't47', 't26', 't69', 't80', 't82', 't92', 't94', 't97', 't29', etc.\n\nSo, in the string, we have 't29' which is a terminal, 't26' another, 't80', etc.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nNow, to see if this string can be produced by the grammar, I need to check if it can be generated by a series of productions starting from S, expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals, until the entire string is produced.\n\nBut manually tracing this would be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the string length is 19, let's see how many steps that would take.\n\nEach production in CNF either introduces one non-terminal or replaces with two terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC (non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (terminal). So the number of symbols can increase or decrease during expansion.\n\nBut for a string of terminals, the number of symbols is fixed as the length. So, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, we need to expand it into a sequence that results in exactly 19 symbol terminals.\n\nThe grammar starts with S producing NT23 and NT5:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT5\n\nSo, the first expansion is two non-terminals. Each of those can be expanded further.\n\nBut wait, the initial step is S \u2192 NT23 NT5.\n\nEach NT can then expand:\n\nNT23 can be expanded, for example, to NT6 NT9 or to NT23 NT21 or other non-terminals as per the grammar.\n\nThis could go on, but 19 symbols in the string suggests that after several expansion steps, the non-terminals get replaced with terminals, resulting in a 19-symbol string.\n\nBut trying to manually expand this would take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built by recursively using certain productions that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: `t29 t26 t80 t49 t91 t49 t86 t69 t26 t92 t29 t94 t92 t1 t69 t42 t69 t97 t29`\n\nI notice that 't86' and 't49' and 't96' etc. might not have direct productions, as looking through the grammar, I don't see 't86' or 't49' as terminals. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, NT7 is set to 't82', NT20 is 't97', NT18 is 't92', NT12 is 't29', etc. I don't see 't86' or 't49' as terminal productions. So, how is that possible? Because if the string has 't86' and 't49', those should be derived from some non-terminals that eventually expand into those terminals.\n\nBut since the grammar in the problem statement only defines certain non-terminals as terminals, and the rest are non-terminals, it's possible that some non-terminals can produce 't86' and 't49' via multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if those terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals that have 't86' or 't49' as their productions. The only terminals so far are 't1', 't47', 't26', 't69', 't80', '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's see. My task is to determine whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. I need to figure this out step by step, keeping track of the possible derivations.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like a set of production rules where each non-terminal (on the left side) is replaced by exactly two non-terminals (since it's Chomsky normal form, which allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a). The terminals are the 't' followed by a number. Some of the rules also include a period and capital letters, but I think those are just formatting for distinguishing non-terminals from terminals. So, the actual terminals are like t28, t82, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t28 t82 t69 t82 t26 t91 t82 t59 t86 t86 t1 t18 t42 t82 t59 t92 t42 t28 t18`.\n\nLet me write this down more condensed to see the sequence: t28, t82, t69, t82, t26, t91, t82, t59, t86, t86, t1, t18, t42, t82, t59, t92, t42, t28, t18.\n\nOkay, now I need to see if each token in this string can be generated by the grammar. Since Chomsky normal form allows us to use a top-down approach with a parse tree, I can start from the start symbol, which seems to be 'S'. Wait, looking back, the grammar starts with S, and from the rules, S can produce various combinations. Each production starts with S and goes to a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT24 NT24, then other similar rules. So each S production is a pair of NTs. Then, each NT has its own productions. For example, NT23 can be NT5 NT25, or NT6 NT9, etc.\n\nSo, the plan is to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S, and see if each token can be matched.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step. The string starts with t28. So, I'm looking for a production for t28. Wait, in the grammar, are there any terminals in the productions? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce a terminal, like 't49', 't50', 't26', etc. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6, NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3, etc. Some rules directly produce a terminal, such as:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t94\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT22 \u2192 t28\n- NT20 \u2192 t97\n- NT18 \u2192 t92\n- NT12 \u2192 t29\n- NT26 \u2192 t12\n- NT27 \u2192 t82\n- NT30 \u2192 t86\n- NT15 \u2192 t50\n- NT2 \u2192 t94\n- NT26 \u2192 t69\n- NT30 \u2192 t86\n- NT24 \u2192 t42\n- NT16 \u2192 t59\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT11 \u2192 t18\n- NT2 \u2192 t62\n- etc.\n\nWait, so many NTs produce a single terminal. That complicates things because each of those corresponds to a single non-terminal node in the parse tree. So, for each 't' token in the input, we have to match a production of that non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting with the first token, t28. Let's see which non-terminal produces t28. Looking through the rules, I see that NT26 \u2192 t69 and NT26 \u2192 t62, as well as NT26 \u2192 NT6 NT7, etc. Wait, but I also recall that some NTs might produce a terminal directly, like NT22 \u2192 t28. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the rules, yes, NT22 has a production NT22 \u2192 t28. So that's one way to get t28. So, the first part of the string could be from NT22 \u2192 t28.\n\nSo, let's tentatively parse the first token as NT22 \u2192 t28.\n\nNow, moving to the next token, t82. Let's see what non-terminal produces t82. Checking the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t82, so yes, NT27 can produce t82. So, the second token can come from NT27 \u2192 t82.\n\nSo, far, we have S \u2192 NT22 NT82 (but wait, S is S \u2192 NT22 NT27? Or does it involve a different production? Wait, S is the start, so the initial production must be S \u2192 NT_A NT_B.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe input string is t28 t82 t69 t82 t26 t91 t82 t59 t86 t86 t1 t18 t42 t82 t59 t92 t42 t28 t18.\n\nWe've started with t28, which is NT22 \u2192 t28. So the first part was NT22, and the rest of the string is t82 t69 ... So, S \u2192 NT22 NT27. So, that part of the derivation is S \u2192 NT22 NT27.\n\nNow, the next token is t82, which is from NT27 \u2192 t82. So that's the first step: NT27 \u2192 t82.\n\nThen, the next token is t69. Let's find who produces t69. Looking through the rules, I see that NT26 can produce t69 via the production NT26 \u2192 t69.\n\nSo, the third token is t69, which comes from NT26 \u2192 t69.\n\nSo now, in the derivation, we have: NT27 \u2192 t82, and then the token after that is t69. So, the structure might be (something) NT27 (something) \u2192 t82, and then (something) NT26 (something) \u2192 t69, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering that the entire string needs to be matched by S. Since S produces two non-terminals, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT22 NT27. So, the string starts with NT22 followed by NT27.\n\nNow, NT22 produces t28, which matches the first token. So, the first two steps are:\n\nS \u2192 NT22 NT27\nNT22 \u2192 t28\nNT27 \u2192 t82\n\nSo, the first two tokens are consumed as t28 and t82.\n\nNow, the next token is t69. What's next? The remaining string is t69 t82 t59 t86 t86 t1 t18 t42 t82 t59 t92 t42 t28 t18.\n\nSo, after t82 (from NT27), the next token is t69. That must come from the other non-terminal in the second half of the production.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT22 NT27 leads to t28 and t82, then the rest comes from NT22 and NT27? Wait, no. Let me clarify: S is the root and produces NT22 and NT82 (wait, no, initial production is S \u2192 NT22 NT27, for example).\n\nWait, looking back, the first production is S \u2192 NT24 NT24. Then others like S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So, each S production has two non-terminals.\n\nIn my case, after starting with S \u2192 NT22 NT27, the first two tokens are t28 and t82, as NT22 \u2192 t28 and NT27 \u2192 t82.\n\nNow, the next token is t69, which comes from some NT. Looking at the rules, I see that NT26 \u2192 t69. So, the next production after the first two tokens should be something that starts with NT26. But wait, the next production in the parse tree should be something that produces the next token.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. After consuming the first two tokens (t28 and t82), the next step is to look for a production that can generate the next token (t69), which comes from a non-terminal. So, we need to have a production where one of the NTs on the right-hand side can produce t69.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, so I'll break it down into individual tokens to analyze each step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the tokens in order:\nt21, t94, t92, t80, t50, t42, t97, t18, t62, t82, t91, t69, t78, t62, t47, t23, t59, t59, t29, t23.\n\nI know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, in CNF, the start symbol has at least two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Here, the start symbol is S.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if each token can be derived according to the grammar rules.\n\n1. The first token is t21. Looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce a terminal. For example, NT2->t47, but I don't see t21 directly. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT21 -> t21. So perhaps S can produce NT21 leading to t21. Let me check the productions:\n\n   The grammar has NT21 \u2192 t21. \n\n   So, S starts, and S can produce NT21, which then becomes t21. That matches the first token. Good.\n\n2. Next, the second token is t94. Let's see if there's a production that can derive t94. Looking through the productions, I see that NT2->t94. So, after the first t21, we need the next symbol to be t94. That means we have to go from the first symbol in the string after the initial t21.\n\nWait, maybe I need to structure it more clearly. Let's consider the parsing as a sequence of productions.\n\nStarting with S:\n- S can produce NT21, which gives t21. So after S, we consume t21 and move to the next token.\n\nNow the next token is t94. So from S, after generating t21, we need to generate t94. But S doesn't directly produce t94. Alternatively, perhaps after S, the next step is to produce a non-terminal that can derive t94. Looking at the productions:\n- NT2 \u2192 t94.\n\nSo, for the second token, after t21, we can have S again, but since the string is a sequence, maybe we're in the middle of a larger expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe each symbol in the string corresponds to a production from a non-terminal that is part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a series of terminals, and each terminal is derived from a production rule. So the entire string must be the result of replacing S with a sequence of productions, each time expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nWait, more accurately, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and the grammar must generate exactly that sequence through a series of derivations starting from S.\n\nTherefore, each token in the string must correspond to a terminal derived from a production rule. So perhaps I should try to derive the string step by step, starting from S.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time, given the number of tokens. Alternatively, perhaps I can model each step as a context-free parsing, checking if the string can be generated.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nStep 1: S\n\nThe initial symbol is S. We'll consider the first token t21.\n\nLooking for productions where a non-terminal can directly produce t21. I see that NT21 \u2192 t21. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT21, which produces t21. Then, we're left with more tokens to parse.\n\nSo after S, we have NT21 \u2192 t21, then the next part of the string.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is a fully expanded string, so each non-terminal in the derivation corresponds to a token in the string. So the string is an expansion of S, so every non-terminal that arises must derive a sequence of tokens.\n\nWait, for the string to be generated by S, every non-terminal expansion in the process must match the tokens in the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as a leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me start with S and see how the tokens are generated.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT21 (since NT21 \u2192 t21)\n   So, first token is t21. Then, we have to check if the remaining tokens can be generated by NT21.\n\n2. NT21 \u2192 t21 (produced first token)\n   Now, we're done with that. The next token is t94, which must come from some expansion. Wait, but in leftmost derivation, after S \u2192 NT21, we should proceed to expand NT21. But NT21 directly produces t21, so that's the end of that. So the next symbol must be another non-terminal or terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing the order. Let me consider the entire string and see if there's any branching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to parse the string in reverse, using a stack, but that might be complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS or produces a single terminal. So each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one (if a non-terminal is replaced by two) or decreases it if a terminal is replaced (but in our case, we're going from S down to terminals only).\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so S must be expanded into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals that can further derive into terminals.\n\nGiven the first token is t21, and NT21 is the non-terminal for it, we can proceed.\n\nNow, after S \u2192 NT21 (producing t21), the next step is to see what's after t21. The next token is t94. So, from NT21, we need to generate t94. But looking at NT21's productions, do I have NT21 producing anything beyond t21? Let me check the initial grammar:\n\nLooking back, the grammar entries for NT21: looking through the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n\nNo other productions for NT21. So once NT21 is expanded to t21, there's nothing more to do. That implies that after t21, the next tokens must all be directly produced by NT21, but since NT21 only produces t21, any tokens after that must come from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the string has more tokens after t21, so perhaps S can be expanded into multiple non-terminals that each derive a sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I approached the parsing incorrectly. Let's consider that the entire string is a result of expanding S and its adjacent non-terminals.\n\nLet me represent the string as a list of tokens and try to match them step by step.\n\nToken list: t21, t94, t92, t80, t50, t42, t97, t18, t62, t82, t91, t69, t78, t62, t47, t23, t59, t59, t29, t23\n\nFirst token is t21, which comes from NT21 \u2192 t21. So, S \u2192 NT21, which gives t21, and now we need to see how to produce the next tokens.\n\nBut what's after NT21? Since NT21 only produces t21, the next part of the string must come from another non-terminal or maybe a production that involves NT21 in more complex dependencies.\n\nWait, maybe after NT21, the next symbol is another non-terminal that produces the next tokens. But in the string, the next token is t94, so perhaps the next non-terminal is derived to produce t94.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions, I see NT2 \u2192 t94. So if after NT21, the next part is NT2, then:\n\nS \u2192 NT21 \u2192 t21, then S \u2192 NT21... but after NT21 is consumed, the next non-terminal must be another, like maybe NT2, which then produces t94. But in the string, after t21 is t94, which could come from NT2.\n\nWait, but in leftmost derivation, after S \u2192 NT21, we would go on to expand the leftmost symbol, which is NT21. Since NT21 \u2192 t21, and that's the end, the next token after t21 must come from a different non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT21, and then the next part of the string is derived from another production. Let me think differently.\n\nMaybe S expands into something like NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-364","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is a series of symbols: `t21 t23 t1 t80 t59 t78 t62 t49 t47 t29 t50 t29 t47 t42 t80 t50 t80 t23 t42 t47`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG and the string. CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, looking at the grammar, every production is either a single terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. That makes parsing potentially easier since each step will consume either one or two symbols.\n\nThe grammar has various productions. For example, S can produce combinations like NT23, NT24, and so on. Then, NT23 can produce combinations like NT5 and NT25, and so on down the chain. The NT terminals eventually produce 't' symbols with numbers attached. \n\nThe string starts with `t21`, which I notice appears multiple times. I also see that `t49`, `t50`, etc., are present. The first thing I notice is that the sequence must follow the productions defined in the CFG.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, I'll try to see how these 't' symbols can be derived. For example, NT21 can produce NT10 and NT9, and NT9 can produce NT5 and NT2. NT5 can produce NT10 and NT17, and so on. But the string starts with t21, which might correspond to an NT21 production.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, I see that NT21 is defined as producing NT10 and NT9. So, t21 would come from NT21. Now, looking at the string, the first token is t21, so maybe the start symbol S can produce something leading to t21. But looking back, S has several productions, one of which is S \u2192 NT23 NT1. NT23 can produce more non-terminals, but eventually, it must derive into terminal symbols.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S is the start symbol, so the string must be derived starting from S. The string given is a sequence of t's, so that must correspond to a sequence of derivations from S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Each symbol in the string is a terminal. So, let's see the string length: 21 symbols. That's manageable.\n\nI'll try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let's break down the string:\n\nt21, t23, t1, t80, t59, t78, t62, t49, t47, t29, t50, t29, t47, t42, t80, t50, t80, t23, t42, t47.\n\nI'll start by mapping these to the grammar.\n\nFirst, looking at t21. From the grammar, NT21 produces NT10 and NT9. So, that's two non-terminals. Then, those can be expanded into more non-terminals, but they must eventually terminate at terminals.\n\nLooking at NT10, in the grammar, NT10 can produce NT14 and NT22, or NT22 and NT6, etc. NT14 produces NT26 and NT17, etc. Hmm, this could get complex. Let me see if any of these produce a t symbol.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some NT symbols produce terminal strings like t49, t50, t21, etc. For example, NT2, NT5, etc., sometimes produce t.\n\nWait, let me check the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\n- NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30\n- NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25\n- NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11\n- NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n- NT27 \u2192 NT2 NT23\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT20\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT9\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal t. Did I miss something? Oh, wait, in the grammar's list, some rules have 't' as the RHS, like:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nAh, so some of the NT productions are rules where they produce a single 't' followed by a number. So, for example, NT26 can produce 't23' directly. Similarly, NT30 can produce 't29', and so on.\n\nSo, the way to generate terminals is when an NT gets reduced to a single 'tX' production. So, the string is composed of tX symbols, which could be the result of certain NT productions.\n\nSo, let's think about how the entire string is built. It must be derived starting from S, and each production step adds a symbol or two.\n\nLooking at S's productions, one of them is S \u2192 NT23 NT1. So, in that case, S can be split into two non-terminals, NT23 and NT1. Let's see if that could lead to the given string.\n\nBut let's look at the string. It starts with t21. So, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT21 NT9, as seen in S's productions (S \u2192 NT23 NT1, etc., but looking at the S productions, I see S \u2192 NT23 NT1, wait no, checking the top-level productions, S is defined as S -> NT23 NT24 NT... etc., wait the initial S productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24? Wait, wait no:\n\nLooking back, the S productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nWait, no, looking again, the user provided a long list, but it's organized in a way that each S production is on a new line.\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, the user presented the grammar as follows:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\n\nWait, no, in the context, the user wrote:\n\n\"Here is the string you need to evaluate:...\", then the grammar.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- S is defined as:\n\n  S -> NT23 NT24 NT24\n\n  Wait, no, the user wrote:\n\n- The grammar has these as S productions:\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\n...\n\nS -> NT1\"\n\nSo it seems that the S can produce multiple different options. So, for example, one S production is S -> NT23 NT23, another is S -> NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nBut in our case, the string starts with t21, so maybe the initial expansion is from a production that leads to t21. For example, if one of S's productions is S -> NT21 something, then t21 could be the first symbol.\n\nWait, looking at S's productions, I see that S can produce NT23, NT20, NT17, etc., but does S have a production that uses NT21? Looking at the list, I don't see S -> NT21 anything. S's productions are primarily combinations of two NFs. So, perhaps S cannot directly derive to something ending with t21. So maybe the S production that leads to t21 is via another production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S production that starts with NT21 is not listed because I didn't pay attention. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see the rules at the end:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, no, the end of the user's provided grammar shows:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the top of the user's grammar, near"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-375","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is `t42 t91 t18 t18 t29 t29 t86 t21 t80 t23 t50 t49 t91 t47 t23 t82 t29 t18 t42 t97 t1`. That's quite a long string, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form looks like. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions seem to fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the string can be generated by the grammar. The string consists of a sequence of terminal symbols, each starting with a 't' followed by digits. The non-terminals are things like S, NT23, NT30, etc. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLet me start by identifying the initial symbol, which is S. The grammar's S has several productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT25 (or similar, checking the rules)\nWait, looking again, the user provided the grammar with various S productions, each with two or more parts. Let me list them:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20\nWait, no, looking at the user input, the grammar lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nWait, no, looking at the initial code block, the user listed the grammar rules, starting with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25? Or perhaps it's S \u2192 NT23 NT24? Wait, no, let me parse the user input correctly.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\n```S -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n```\n\nWait, no, the user separated each production with lines like:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, no, the user may have used some code formatting, so perhaps each production is on a new line. So, the S productions are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT25? Or wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. No, in the user's message, it's written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps each production is written with a rule on a single line, such as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, but each line for S has two production options. To clarify, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT23 NT24 NT25 S -> NT20 NT16 S -> NT17 NT3 S -> NT20 NT6 S -> NT9 NT5 ...\".\n\nHmm, perhaps the user presented S's productions as multiple lines, each line being a separate production. So, S can produce NT23 NT24 NT25, NT20 NT16, NT17 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the user's message again, the first five lines after the grammar prompt are the S productions:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these is a separate production rule for S. So, S can produce each of these sequences as a single production.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal, so perhaps each production is a single step. Or perhaps the user presented them as the right-hand sides. Wait, in the user's message, each line after S is written with an arrow, so it's like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT25, etc.\n\nBut this could be confusion between multiple productions. So, perhaps I should look at the entire list of productions carefully.\n\nWait, the user presented the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n...\netc.\n\nSo, yes, S can produce NT23 NT24 NT25, or NT20 NT16, etc. Each production for S is a rule that replaces S with a single non-terminal followed by another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of terminal symbols: t42 t91 t18 t18 t29 t29 t86 t21 t80 t23 t50 t49 t91 t47 t23 t82 t29 t18 t42 t97 t1.\n\nSo, each element in the string is a terminal, which must correspond to the leaves in the parse tree. Our task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, i.e., starting from S, the grammar can derive this string.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, each step replaces a non-terminal with its definition. Since the string has 21 terminals, the parse tree must have a path from S to each terminal, with possible intermediate non-terminals along the way.\n\nBut manually trying to parse this string could be time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for ways to break the string into chunks that fit the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I should check if the first and last parts can be connected via the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider looking for patterns or repeated sub-strings that could correspond to repeated applications of certain productions.\n\nLet me first list all the productions to see if any terminals in the string match directly from the terminals in the productions.\n\nWait, the productions have rules like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT25, but more importantly, each production is a combination of non-terminals. So, I'll need to see how these non-terminals can lead to the given terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the productions of NTs, for example:\n\nNT23 has production NT5 NT25, but NT25 is another non-terminal, which might eventually produce a terminal, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals lead to specific terminals. For example, NT2 might produce t47, etc.\n\nLet me check the productions for each NT. For example, looking at the user's grammar:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\n- NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\n- NT10 \u2192 NT19 NT12\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT21 \u2192 NT5 NT14\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT28\n- NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0\n- etc.\n\nAnd certain NTs lead to terminals, like:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t47\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n- NT8 \u2192 t8\nWait, let me look for NTs that have productions directly to terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t47 (from user's message)\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n- NT8 \u2192 t91 (Hmm, user's message shows that NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28, which may lead to more non-terminals)\nWait, no: the user's productions include:\n\nLooking back, perhaps the user's grammar includes NT8 \u2192 t91, but let me check.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NTs, several seem to produce terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t47\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n- NT8 \u2192 t91\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT29 \u2192 t89 (Wait, looking for NT8 \u2192 t91, but in the user's grammar, the productions for NT8 are:\n\nWait, for example, one of the lines is:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28\n\nAnother line is:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT18 NT16\n\nAnd another:\n\nNT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-382","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to check is `t49 t21 t50 t92 t59 t94 t28 t21 t42 t28 t50 t91 t50 t97 t1 t82 t69 t80 t21 t28 t28`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF is a set of rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right side. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to consist of various non-terminals (like S, NT23, NT30, etc.) and terminals which are strings like 't49', 't21', etc. My task is to see if the string provided can be generated by the start symbol S.\n\nSince the string only contains terminals, I need to parse it step by step, checking if it can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by listing all the terminals in the string in order: t49, t21, t50, t92, t59, t94, t28, t21, t42, t28, t50, t91, t50, t97, t1, t82, t69, t80, t21, t28, t28. \n\nI notice that the string's length is 21 tokens. Since each production in CNF either produces one terminal or two non-terminals, the parse tree depth should correspond to the number of terminals, minus one, with branching at each step.\n\nI should start by looking for possible top-down or bottom-up derivations. Since the problem doesn't specify, maybe a bottom-up approach would be easier. However, since I'm a bit rusty on that, I might try to find a leftmost or rightmost derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to model this as a parse tree and see if each terminal matches the tokens in the string. Each internal node would be a non-terminal that can be expanded according to the rules, and the leaves should be the terminals in the correct order.\n\nAlso, looking at the grammar, there are a lot of productions. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT5, and many others. I should also note that some non-terminals expand into terminals, like NT0 \u2192 't26', or NT15 \u2192 't50'. Others expand into other non-terminals, which then may expand further.\n\nLet me check each non-terminal to see which produce which terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t26\n- NT15 \u2192 t50\n- NT23 \u2192 t49, etc.? Wait, no, looking back at the rules, many NTs expand into other non-terminals and some into terminals. For example, NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT22. Not immediately helpful. Wait, in the rules provided, some non-terminals immediately produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t10 NT17 (Wait, no, looking again: Oh, no, the rules seem a bit confusing. Wait, let's parse them more carefully. \n\nWait, the rules provided are a bit unclear in the initial parse. Wait, for example, the first rule is S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. Wait, no, the initial presentation might be mixed. Let me look again.\n\nWait, at the very beginning of the grammar list, the rules are written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\nBut then another line is S -> NT20 NT16\nWait, that can't be right because a production in CNF should have exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for terminal productions. So perhaps the initial lines are incorrect, but maybe that's a mistake in the user input.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me check again:\n\nThe user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT30 -> NT3 NT1\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24\nNT7 -> NT22 NT27\nNT1 -> NT0 NT3\nNT29 -> NT7 NT8\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT19 -> NT23 NT27\nNT18 -> NT10 NT26\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\nNT10 -> NT14 NT22\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\nNT19 -> NT29 NT29\nNT4 -> NT0 NT11\nNT4 -> NT15 NT26\nNT6 -> NT6 NT7\nNT12 -> NT12 NT22\nNT10 -> NT7 NT8\nNT27 -> NT2 NT23\nNT0 -> NT27 NT11\nNT21 -> NT10 NT9\nNT23 -> NT20 NT4\nNT10 -> NT19 NT12\nNT9 -> NT5 NT2\nNT21 -> NT5 NT14\nNT0 -> NT2 NT5\nNT20 -> NT28 NT0\nNT23 -> NT23 NT21\nNT3 -> NT2 NT25\nNT30 -> NT10 NT22\nNT12 -> NT18 NT28\nNT7 -> NT23 NT2\nNT11 -> NT15 NT0\nNT0 -> NT6 NT28\nNT29 -> NT29 NT30\nNT12 -> NT29 NT9\nNT1 -> NT30 NT27\nNT28 -> NT20 NT18\nNT12 -> NT22 NT6\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\nNT4 -> NT8 NT19\nNT20 -> NT17 NT8\nNT27 -> NT4 NT26\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\nNT26 -> NT8 NT26\nNT6 -> NT11 NT14\nNT2 -> NT25 NT19\nNT26 -> NT2 NT19\nNT26 -> NT4 NT29\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\nNT15 -> NT2 NT8\nNT2 -> NT15 NT9\nNT0 -> NT2 NT22\nNT21 -> NT28 NT24\nNT23 -> NT4 NT23\nNT25 -> NT30 NT11\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\nNT8 -> NT9 NT19\nNT23 -> NT16 NT16\nNT28 -> NT24 NT23\nNT2 -> NT25 NT19\nNT5 -> NT10 NT17\nNT26 -> NT12 NT7\nNT27 -> 't49'\nNT15 -> 't50'\nNT2 -> 't47'\nNT21 -> 't21'\nNT8 -> 't91'\nNT28 -> 't80'\nNT24 -> 't1'\nNT2 -> 't94'\nNT5 -> 't26'\nNT22 -> 't28'\nNT20 -> 't97'\nNT18 -> 't92'\nNT12 -> 't29'\nNT26 -> 't69'\nNT30 -> 't29'\nNT7 -> 't82'\nNT26 -> 't69'\nNT30 -> 't86'\nNT15 -> 't74'\nNT24 -> 't42'\nNT16 -> 't59'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT11 -> 't18'\nNT2 -> 't62'\n\nWait, this makes more sense now. So the grammar consists of multiple productions where some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, and a few directly produce terminals (like NT27 \u2192 't49', NT15 \u2192 't50', etc.). \n\nNow, each of these direct terminals must correspond to some part of the string. The string provided is: `t49 t21 t50 t92 t59 t94 t28 t21 t42 t28 t50 t91 t50 t97 t1 t82 t69 t80 t21 t28 t28`. \n\nSo, the first term is t49. Looking at the production rules, I can see that NT27 \u2192 t49. So, t49 must be a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nSimilarly, next is t21, which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-385","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has specific structures that I can use to my advantage.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the production rules in the grammar are of the form A \u2192 BC, which makes the process a bit more straightforward. Additionally, each production either consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. My goal is to see if the string can be derived using these rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t69 t47 t42 t86 t80 t21 t86 t42 t21 t78 t1 t21 t94 t91 t97 t97 t42 t59 t97 t91 t78 t29`.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals eventually produce a single terminal 't' followed by a two-digit number, like 't47', 't80', etc., or some might produce other terminals like 't94', 't91', etc. I also see that some non-terminals produce a terminal, like 't42', 't74', 't59', etc., but in the given string, I don't see any such direct terminals except maybe 't42' a few times.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the non-terminals listed in the grammar, each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, the production NT30 -> NT9 NT7 would mean it can only produce combinations, but some NT productions actually produce a terminal, like NT23 -> 't49', right? So some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, specifically those that end with 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, but in the given string, I'm looking at a sequence of 't's and numbers, probably corresponding to the terminal productions. So the string consists of a series of terminals which are the results of non-terminals expanding into 't' followed by some number.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the string itself might be a sequence of such terminal symbols. However, in the given string, it's a series of 't's followed by numbers, which might correspond to the derived terminals.\n\nI think I need to map each 't' followed by digits to the actual terminal symbols in the grammar. Let me see: NT23 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't47', NT21 -> 't21', NT8 -> 't91', NT28 -> 't80', NT24 -> 't1', NT2 -> 't94', NT5 -> 't26', NT22 -> 't28', NT20 -> 't97', NT18 -> 't92', NT12 -> 't29', NT26 -> 't23', NT30 -> 't86', NT7 -> 't82', NT26 -> 't69', NT30 -> 't86', NT15 -> 't74', NT24 -> 't42', NT16 -> 't59', NT9 -> 't78', NT11 -> 't18', NT2 -> 't62'.\n\nWait, but each non-terminal only produces one terminal. For example, NT30 can produce 't86' only if both symbols expand to that. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' number represents a specific expansion. For instance, NT23 -> 't49' might mean that the symbol NT23 can derive the string 't49'. Similarly, NT20 could derive 't97', etc.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's a sequence of 't's with numbers, which suggests that each 't' is part of a terminal node in the derivation. However, the grammar doesn't include all those terminals directly; instead, each NT production leads to specific terminals in an indirect but fixed manner.\n\nWait, but in the given string, there are 21 tokens separated by spaces. Each would correspond to a terminal produced by an NT production. So I need to check if each of these terminal sequences can be derived by some NT production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each NT production only expands to two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation tree would have each node as either a non-terminal that splits into two or a terminal. Therefore, the string is a concatenation of the derived terminals at each leaf.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of 21 terminals, each being a 't' followed by a number. Each of these corresponds to a specific NT production expanding into that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, the first token is 't69'. Looking at the grammar, NT23 -> 't49', but wait, in the grammar, there's a production NT23 -> 't49'? Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT23 is defined in two places. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I think I might be mixing up the productions. Let me list some key productions:\n\n- NT30 -> 't86' appears multiple times, maybe it's one production. Wait, no, in the grammar, each unique non-terminal has a specific expansion.\n\nWait, let me reorganize the grammar. I think I might have some confusion because some non-terminals have multiple productions, but in CNF, each non-terminal has exactly one production, so each line corresponds to the definition of that non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the initial problem, the grammar is presented as a series of lines, each starting with 'S -> ' etc. So each S, NT23, etc., have their own productions. So, for example, S has multiple productions.\n\nBut I think my confusion arises because the grammar is complex, and I need to figure out which NT produces which terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the given grammar is actually a collection of non-terminals and their possible terminals, but that seems off because each expansion in Chomsky Normal Form should be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, some non-terminals produce two non-terminals (e.g., S -> NT23 NT5), others produce a terminal like NT23 -> 't49', but I think in the given grammar, some of the NTs expand to a single terminal.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the list:\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT5\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nThen, for NT23: several lines, like NT23 -> NT5 NT25; also NT23 -> NT6 NT9; and others like NT23 -> NT27 NT30, etc. Hmm, perhaps that's not possible because in CNF, each non-terminal should have only one production. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is incorrectly written, but assuming that each non-terminal has only one production, the rest are terminals. But in the given grammar, multiple productions for the same non-terminal, which is not standard in CNF. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line represents a production for that non-terminal, and they're just multiple possible expansions, but typically, in CNF, a non-terminal would have only one production. This seems inconsistent, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar.\n\nWait, the initial question says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but looking at the provided grammar, each non-terminal seems to have multiple productions. In Chomsky Normal Form, each non-terminal should have exactly one production, so perhaps the provided grammar is actually a list of all the productions, possibly with S on top, and other NTs, but some non-terminals have multiple productions, which shouldn't be the case.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the structure is that the grammar starts with S, followed by other NTs, and each line is a production. But that doesn't align with CNF because each non-terminal has only one production. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the grammar is presented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each line is a production, and S is the start symbol, but the NTs after the arrows are non-terminals, and the rest are terminals. But that's unclear. For example, S -> NT23 NT5 would be a production where S is replaced by NT23 and NT5. But NT5 is then another non-terminal, leading to another production.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each line in the grammar is a production rule, and the NTs on the right-hand side can either be terminals or other NTs. So, for example, S -> NT23 NT5 would replace S with NT23 and NT5, which are both NTs and thus would each expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nBut in the given string, all the elements are terminals, which are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs directly produce a terminal. For example, looking deeper in the grammar:\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-390","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The string is `t50 t59 t18 t42 t80 t23 t26 t74 t74 t62 t78 t42 t26 t62 t42 t94 t47 t21 t47 t23 t97 t62`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using methods like recursive descent or with parsers that use a stack. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production either has two terminals or two non-terminals. That's helpful because it makes the parsing process more straightforward, using a simple stack-based method.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals are connected to terminals like 't50', 't59', etc. The first thing I notice is that the string starts with 't50'. Looking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, I see that 't50' is directly produced by the rule `NT15 -> t50`. Similarly, 't59' is produced by `NT16 -> t59`, and 't26' by `NT26 -> t26`.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is `t50 t59`. So I need to see if there's a production rule that can derive these two together. From the grammar, I see that NT15 can produce NT8 and NT2, where NT8 can produce 't8' and NT2 can produce 't94'. Hmm, that might not lead directly to 't50' followed by 't59'.\n\nAlternatively, considering the start symbol S, it's followed by production rules that combine non-terminals like S -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NTNT24, but that might complicate things. Maybe I should look for an overall structure.\n\nWait, looking at the production for NT20, it can produce 't97', 't23', 't74', 't62', 't78', 't42', etc. Also, NT17 can produce 't19', 't8', etc. Maybe the string starts with 't50' from NT15, then 't59' from NT16.\n\nBut I'm not sure how those connect in the overall production. Maybe I should think of the entire string as a series of steps starting from S.\n\nAnother approach is to break the string into the sequence of terminals and see how they could emerge from the non-terminals. The string is long and has several t's like t74, t42, t23, etc. Each of these corresponds to specific production rules.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the string is in t's, maybe each t corresponds to a single non-terminal symbol that directly produces that t.\n\nWait, looking at each 'tX' and the grammar:\n\n- `NT15 -> t50`\n- `NT16 -> t59`\n- `NT26 -> t26`\n- `NT23 -> t42` (multiple times)\n- `NT6 -> t62` (multiple times)\n- `NT74` and others, but 't74' is 't74', but in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT74; wait, the right-hand side of NT74 might not exist, perhaps it's a terminal. Or maybe NT74 is NT24's production? Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, for NT7, it's `NT7 -> NT23 NT2`, right? And that then can produce 't42' and 't97'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 'tX' corresponds to an S or other production. Since the string starts with 't50 t59', maybe S starts with NT15 NT16 or NT15 followed by something else.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe start symbol S can produce NT23 NT24, etc. Let's see:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NTNT24. But the string doesn't have that. So maybe S starts with NT23.\n\nWait, another start rule is S -> NT23 NT24, but that's only two non-terminals, but the string starts with two t's, which are t50 and t59. So maybe NT23 can produce t50 and t59? But looking, NT23 is `NT23 -> NT5 NT25`. Hmm, so to get t50, NT15 produces it, not NT23. So that path doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT20 NT16. Let's see, can NT20 produce t97 and NT16 produce t59? Looking back, NT20 can have several productions. For example, NT20 -> t97, t18, etc. So, if NT20 produces t97 and NT16 produces t59, then S -> NT20 NT16 could start the string with t97 t59, but the string starts with t50 t59, which doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the initial string can be split into parts corresponding to each production step. Each non-terminal in the string must come from a production rule.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t50 t59 t18 t42 t80 t23 t26 t74 t74 t62 t78 t42 t26 t62 t42 t94 t47 t21 t47 t23 t97 t62.\n\nSince terminals correspond to specific productions, I can try to map the string into non-terminal productions.\n\nStarting with t50: that must come from NT15. Then after NT15, the next term is t59, which comes from NT16. So the production at the top level could involve S producing something that connects NT15 and NT16, but the initial S rules don't have both NT15 and NT16 in their productions. Looking at the start symbols, S's first option is NT23 NT24, which doesn't include NT15 or NT16. The second is NT20 NT16, but NT20 can produce t97 or other t's, not t50. Third, NT17 NT3, which seems unrelated. Fourth, NT20 NT6, which again doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look for where NT15 and something else produce t50 and another terminal. Looking at the grammar, do I have any productions that combine NT15 and another non-terminal that could produce the next t's?\n\nLooking at NT15's productions: NT15 -> NT8 NT2, but NT8 is `NT8 -> NT1 NT28`, which complicates things. Alternatively, NT15 might be followed by NT2, which is NT21: `NT21 -> NT28 NT24`. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the higher-level productions of NT23. So NT23 can produce NT5 NT25, which might further break down.\n\nWait, let's try to reconstruct the production steps:\n\n1. S can produce several combinations, but perhaps one that starts with NT20 NT16, as that gives us t97 and t59. Wait, but t59 is t59, which is from NT16. So if we have NT20 -> t97 and NT16 -> t59, that would produce t97 t59, but the string starts with t50 t59. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S produces NT15 NT16. Looking at NT15 -> t50 and NT16 -> t59. So that would be t50 t59. That's the start of the string. Yes, that matches the first two terms.\n\nSo, if the first production is S -> NT15 NT16, which yields t50 and t59. Then, after that, the rest of the string is t18 t42 t80 t23 t26 t74 t74 t62 t78 t42 t26 t62 t42 t94 t47 t21 t47 t23 t97 t62.\n\nSo after the initial NT15 and NT16, we have to see what follows. Let's see, NT16 is the second component, which is `NT16 -> t59`, so that's a terminal and the string has t59 there. So the production is complete for S in this case.\n\nWait, no, in S's production, if it's S -> NT15 NT16, then both NT15 and NT16 must appear. So the string starts with t50 (from NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-397","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are various strings ending with 't' followed by numbers. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t59 t42 t28 t91 t42 t94 t59 t50 t91 t62 t21 t23 t97 t50 t49 t26 t28 t94 t26 t91 t74 t97 t28`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals, or a single terminal. So any valid derivation sequence for the string must consist of steps where each step expands a non-terminal into two others, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into individual tokens and see if I can find a possible derivation path.\n\nFirst token: t59. Looking at the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT8, and NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8, etc. Wait, but t59 is a terminal. Let me check the grammar for any production where the terminal part is 't59'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2, and S productions are all S \u2192 NT... so maybe I need to see where 't59' appears as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT16 \u2192 't59'. So the production is NT16 \u2192 t59. So to get t59, the non-terminal must be NT16.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S can produce NT23 and NT5, etc. I need to see which production can lead to NT16. Let's look for NT16 in the productions.\n\nI see NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2, NT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nBut to get t59, the earlier step must be NT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nWait, the initial string starts with t59, which is from NT16. So the first thing must be NT16 derived from S. But looking at the start symbol S productions, none directly produce NT16. The starting productions are S \u2192 NT23 NT5, etc. So for S \u2192 NT23 NT5, then each of those can further be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting point is S, so S produces two non-terminals, which then are expanded until all are terminals.\n\nSo for the string, perhaps the first two symbols are generated by the same non-terminal S. But the string starts with t59, which is a single terminal. That might mean that the first step is S \u2192 something that produces a single terminal. But looking at the productions, S all produce two non-terminals. Therefore, the string must start with two non-terminals, each of which eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the first two symbols in the string must be the terminals resulting from S's two non-terminals. But the string starts with t59, so perhaps the first two symbols are t59 and something else. Let me check.\n\nThe string is: t59 t42 t28 t91 t42 t94 t59 t50 t91 t62 t21 t23 t97 t50 t49 t26 t28 t94 t26 t91 t74 t97 t28.\n\nThis is 21 symbols. Since S \u2192 NT... each time producing two NTs, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is 2^(n-1), but wait, no. Actually, each S produces two NTs, so for each application of S's productions, the number of symbols doubles, but since each NT can be terminals or non-terminals, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is of length 21, which is not a power of 2 plus one, so maybe the grammar can't generate it. But that's not necessarily true, as the grammar might allow for some combinations.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals that can each be expanded from the grammar. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with t59, which must come from NT16 \u2192 t59. So the first production is S \u2192 NT16 NT..., but wait, S\u2019s productions are all of the form NT followed by NT. So S \u2192 NT... each time. Therefore, the string must be generated from S starting with two non-terminals, each of which produces a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps each symbol in the string is a terminal, so the entire string must be derived from starting with S, which produces two non-terminals, each of which must eventually produce a single terminal, thereby making the string of even length. But our string is 21 symbols, which is odd. That suggests it's impossible, right?\n\nWait, no, because at each step, non-terminals can produce more symbols. For example, S \u2192 A B, which is two non-terminals, each of which can also be S \u2192 C D, etc. So the number of symbols can grow exponentially.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So each application of a production replaces one non-terminal with two others, which could be terminals or non-terminals. Therefore, the number of symbols (both non-terminals and terminals) in the sentential form increases by one each time a production is applied because one non-terminal is replaced by two symbols. However, in our case, the string is entirely terminals, so the number of terminals must be exactly 1 more than the number of productions applied beyond the initial step.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: starting from S (1 non-terminal), each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each step. To reach a string of k terminals, we need k-1 steps. So for our string, which has 21 terminals, we would need 20 steps. That's theoretically possible, but not sure yet.\n\nBut let's focus on the initial step. The string starts with t59, which we determined must come from S \u2192 NT16 NT... Wait, but looking at the productions, S produces pairs like S \u2192 NT23 NT5, etc. So the first two symbols in the string must be the terminals resulting from NT23 and NT5. Let's check: t59 could be from NT16 \u2192 t59, so S \u2192 NT16 NT...? But looking at S's productions, none of the S productions produce NT16. For example, S's productions are like S \u2192 NT23 NT24, etc. So the first two symbols in the string must come from two different non-terminals that are the children of S.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the first step. Let me see S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nAll S's productions start with NT followed by NT. So for the first step, S is replaced by two non-terminals, say A and B. The string starts with t59, which is a terminal, so one of A or B must be a non-terminal that eventually produces t59.\n\nWait, but since the initial step is replacing S with two non-terminals, each of those can produce one or more terminals. So the first symbol in the string comes from the expansion of the first non-terminal, and the second comes from the expansion of the second non-terminal.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t59, which comes from NT16 \u2192 t59, but looking at S's productions, none of the left-hand sides produce NT16 directly. Wait, S produces NT23 NT24, so the first two non-terminals after S are NT23 and NT24. So for t59 to be the first symbol, perhaps NT23 must somehow produce t59.\n\nLooking back at the productions, I see NT16 \u2192 t59. So to have t59 as the first symbol, the NT23 produced by S must somehow be expanded to t59, which would require a production like NT23 \u2192 NT16 something else.\n\nWait, looking through NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, NT23 \u2192 NT4 NT23, etc. But I don't see a production that directly allows NT23 to produce t59. So that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two symbols are generated from different non-terminals from S's expansion. Let's check S's other productions"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens like 't23', 't47', etc. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the RHS of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol. The productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 t49\nS \u2192 NT20 t16\nS \u2192 NT17 t3\nS \u2192 NT20 t6\nS \u2192 NT9 t5\nAnd so on\u2014wait, no, actually, the productions for S seem to combine NTs and terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT23 t24 seems incorrect because in CNF, each production should be a non-terminal on the LHS and two things on the RHS\u2014either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, right?\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, I see S \u2192 NT23 t49, but in CNF, the RHS should be non-terminals only. So perhaps that's a typo, or maybe the RHS is miswritten. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, no, looking at the start symbol S's productions, I see:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 t49? That would imply S is producing a terminal followed by another non-terminal, but in CNF, each production of S should have only non-terminals on the RHS. Unless S can have a terminal directly as an output, which would make it a production S \u2192 a, but in this case, the RHS is a combination of NT and terminal.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the given grammar again carefully. Hmm, wait, actually the first line after the grammar is \"S -> NT23 t24 NT5\". Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar notation.\n\nWait, no, the initial grammar starts with S -> NT23 t24 NT5. But in CNF, each production should have two symbols on the RHS. So S \u2192 NT23 t49? Or is it S \u2192 NT23, t49, etc.? Hmm, this is unclear. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. Perhaps each production is written with commas separating the RHS symbols, so S is producing multiple symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the slashes are separators. Wait, looking back, the user presented the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT23 t24 NT5\nWait, that can't be right because in CNF, each RHS should have exactly two symbols. Maybe S \u2192 NT23 | t24 | NT5, but that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, and the actual RHS is more like S \u2192 NT23 t24 and NT5, but I'm getting tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for clearer productions. Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT23 t24 NT5, which doesn't make sense because that's three RHS symbols. Then S \u2192 NT20 t16, which is two symbols, which would be acceptable in CNF, but wait\u2014no, t16 is a terminal, and NT20 is a non-terminal, so S \u2192 NT20 t16 would be allowed because it has two symbols (NT20 and t16). Similarly, S \u2192 NT17 t3 is also allowed.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the first line is S \u2192 NT23 t24 NT5, which would imply S has three symbols on the RHS: NT23, t24, and NT5. But that's three, which is more than two, violating CNF. So perhaps that's an error, or perhaps the user wrote the grammar incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user has a typo, and the production is S \u2192 NT23 NT5, but then t24 is a terminal somewhere else.\n\nThis confusion is making it hard to proceed. Perhaps I should focus on the provided string and see if it can be generated by the grammar, ignoring the start symbols for now.\n\nThe string is: t23 t47 t47 t97 t42 t29 t82 t42 t18 t49 t47 t82 t80 t50 t1 t92 t94 t59 t82 t94 t29 t69 t26.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23, which is a terminal. So for the start symbol S to produce this string, one of the productions must have t23 as the first symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol S has productions that include t terms like t49, t16, t3, t6, etc. So in the given grammar, S must have a production that starts with a terminal followed by other terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but earlier, the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which requires that all productions have non-terminals on the LHS with two RHS symbols. So perhaps the initial S productions were meant to be S \u2192 NT23 t24, meaning S can produce NT23 and t24 in sequence. Wait, but in that case, S would produce two symbols: a non-terminal (NT23) and a terminal (t24). So S \u2192 NT23 t24 would imply that after expanding NT23, we get t24. Hmm, but to get t23 in the string, perhaps there's a production where NT23 yields t23 or something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should look for the start productions that produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals are terminals like t23, t24, etc. For example, the production NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. But I'm looking for a production that can derive a terminal. So perhaps the leaves in the parse tree are the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the given grammar has some non-terminals that are terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 t23, but I don't see that in the given productions. Instead, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, and NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8, etc. So perhaps the string can only be derived up to a certain point.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, I notice that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT8 \u2192 t8, etc. Wait, for example, NT8 \u2192 t8, which would be a terminal, right? So that could be a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nWait, scanning through the productions after the start symbol:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce terminals. I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t26\nNT5 \u2192 t26\nNT9 \u2192 t78\nNT10 \u2192 t27\nNT2 \u2192 t82\nNT21 \u2192 t21\nNT23 \u2192 t49\nNT26 \u2192 t69\nNT26 \u2192 t23\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT26 could produce t69 or t23.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nNT26 is present in several productions, like NT26 \u2192 t23, NT26 \u2192 t69, etc. So perhaps in the grammar, there are direct terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with t23, which could come from NT26 \u2192 t23, for example. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBut first, the start symbol S must derive the string. So S must expand into symbols that eventually produce the entire string. Let me try to trace how t23 could be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has productions starting with NT20 or NT17, etc., but also a production S \u2192 NT23 t24 NT5. Wait, I'm not sure because the first production seems to be a three-symbol RHS, which is not allowed in CNF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT23 t24 and NT5, but that would imply S can derive \"NT23 t24 NT5\", but that's three symbols on the RHS, which is against CNF. So maybe that's an error, and it's supposed to be S \u2192 NT23 | something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar. Without knowing, maybe I can assume that S can produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which would mean that the production is S \u2192 NT23 | t24 | NT5, but that doesn't fit Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial productions are written incorrectly, and the correct CNF would have all RHSs with exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-412","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t26 t97 t47 t49 t91 t80 t50 t97 t18 t21 t82 t47 t62 t49 t23 t94 t28 t94 t91 t92 t94 t82 t26 t97`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice many production rules. Some right-hand sides have terminals like 't26', 't49', etc., while others are combinations of non-terminals. For example, I see rules like S -> NT23 NT5 and other NT rules expanding into other NT or terminal symbols. \n\nThe string given consists entirely of terminal symbols (all starting with 't' followed by numbers). To check if this string is generated by the grammar, I might need to simulate how it would be derived. \n\nBut before diving into that, I should see if any of the rules directly produce a terminal symbol. That is, do any production rules have a terminal on the left and just a single terminal on the right? Looking through the grammar, I see that some NT symbols, like NT23, NT12, etc., have rules that start with terminals. For example, NT19 -> NT6 NT19, which doesn't produce a terminal. But others like NT0 -> NT27 NT11, NT2 -> 't47'\u2014oh wait, some right-hand sides are terminals. \n\nWait, no, most of the rules I see have non-terminals on the right side. For example, NT15 -> 't50', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 -> 't47', NT5 -> 't26', etc. So some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals. This suggests that the grammar can produce strings where these non-terminals are expanded to terminals.\n\nThe string we're checking starts with 't26', which I believe is produced by NT5 because looking through the production rules, I see NT5 -> 't26'. So if the string starts with 't26', that could come from NT5.\n\nThen the next symbol is 't97'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production rule that gives NT5 -> 't97', but perhaps another non-terminal does. Looking through the rules, maybe NT0? Let me check: NT0 has several rules, like NT0 -> 't27', NT0 -> NT27 NT11, etc. So NT0 could produce 't27', but not 't97' directly. Maybe another non-terminal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol 't26' comes from NT5, and then 't97' comes from another NT rule. Let me check: does any NT have a production that starts with 't97'?\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT23 -> 't49', so that's a terminal. NT12 -> 't29', NT18 -> 't92', NT20 -> 't97'! Oh, there's NT20 -> 't97'. So 't97' is produced by NT20. Therefore, after 't26' (NT5), the next 't97' (NT20) must be derived from NT20.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't26 t97', which would come from NT5 -> NT20 NT5. Because in Chomsky normal form, S would start, and the initial symbol is S, but when we start deriving, S would expand into NT23 NT5, or another rule. Wait, no, because in the initial step, the derivation starts from S, and the initial symbol is typically a non-terminal. However, in this case, the string starts with terminals. So perhaps S is rewritten into non-terminals that eventually derive into these terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think differently. Since the string is entirely terminal, it must result from the entire start symbol S being rewritten through a series of productions into terminal symbols. So each step must expand non-terminals into other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). \n\nBut given that the string starts with 't26 t97', I can figure out what must have produced these. 't26' is produced by NT5, and 't97' is produced by NT20. Therefore, the initial expansion must produce something like NT5 NT20. Then NT5 must have been rewritten from some other NT.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5's production includes NT5 -> 't26' and also NT5 -> NT24 NT19, etc. Wait, no: in the production rules, I see NT5 -> 't26' and others. So the only way to get 't26' is directly from NT5. But to get the next symbol, which is 't97' from NT20, we need to make sure that the NT5 is part of a production that also produces NT20.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps NT0 -> NT20 NT5 would be a way because 't20' and 't5' are terminals? Or no, wait, no: in the given rules, I don't see NT20 being a terminal, but in the production that is given, like S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So perhaps I need to see how these NTs can be combined.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial symbol S must derive into the given string. So S can expand into NT23 NT5, as per one of the production rules. Let's see: S \u2192 NT23 NT5. Then each of these non-terminals can further expand.\n\nSo the first step from S would be NT23 NT5. Let's see where NT23 and NT5 can derive. NT23 has several productions: NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, and others. Since NT5 can produce 't26', we can track that.\n\nLet me try to build the parse step by step. Starting from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT5\n   - NT23 and NT5 expand further.\n\nWe need to see if we can derive the string step by step, matching the given string. The string is: t26 t97 t47 t49 t91 t80 t50 t97 t18 t21 t82 t47 t62 t49 t23 t94 t28 t94 t91 t92 t94 t82 t26 t97.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't26', which is NT5. So NT5 must derive into 't26' through a production that directly gives it. Looking at the rules, indeed NT5 can produce 't26'.\n\nSo let's say NT5 \u2192 't26'. Then the next symbol is 't97', which is NT20. So after NT5, we have NT20 which must directly produce 't97'. Looking at the production rules, there's a NT20 \u2192 't97' (because I see NT20 -> 't97'), right? Let me check: Yes, looking at the rules, there's a line NT20 -> 't97', so that's a direct production.\n\nSo after NT5, it becomes 't26', then the next must come from NT20 \u2192 't97'. So after the first two symbols, 't26 t97', we have NT23 and NT5 expanded.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial S expansion is S \u2192 NT23 NT5. Then NT23 must expand into something that starts with 't47', which is another possible terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT24 \u2192 't1' and others. Wait, let me see all the rules again. NT2 can produce 't47' because I see NT2 -> 't47'. Similarly, there are other terminals like 't26' (NT5), 't97' (NT20), 't49' (NT23 via a production), etc.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe an alternative method is to reverse the parsing: start from the string and see if it can be reduced according to the grammar rules.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't26', which is NT5. So the first part is 't26', which comes from NT5. So, looking at the production rules, NT5 can either produce a terminal or other non-terminals. The production is NT5 \u2192 't26' or other combinations. Therefore, to get 't26', NT5 must be expanded directly."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. Let me start by understanding the components of the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a start symbol S and several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT23, NT30, etc.) leading to terminal strings (like t47, t21, etc.). The string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t74 t42 t50 t29 t49 t74 t78 t42 t78 t80 t21 t26 t69 t49 t49 t80 t94 t29 t69 t42 t21 t59 t29 t97`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules. Each production rule is bivariate, meaning each production is from one non-terminal to two non-terminals. This looks like a binary tree structure where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules and see if they can be applied to match the string. However, with so many non-terminals and terminals, this could get complex. Maybe a better approach is to look for patterns or possible breakdowns of the string.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S. Looking at the grammar rules, S can expand into:\n\nS -> NT23 NT5\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these options starts with different non-terminals. So the string must begin with the terminals produced by one of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t74. Let's see which non-terminals can generate t74. Scanning the production rules, I see:\n\nNT24 -> t1\nNT5 -> t26\nNT15 -> t50\nNT2 -> t94\nNT8 -> t91\nNT28 -> t80\nNT24 -> t42\nNT16 -> t59\nNT9 -> t78\nNT2 -> t62\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce t74. Wait, perhaps another path. Let me check if any NT leads to t74. Looking through the rules, I notice:\n\nNT15 -> t50\nNT24 -> t42\nNT20 -> t97\nNT18 -> t92\nNT12 -> t29\nNT26 -> t23\nNT30 -> t29\nNT7 -> t82\nNT26 -> t69\nNT30 -> t86\nNT15 -> t74\n\nWait, NT15 in one of the rules is transformed into t74. So, NT15 can end up as t74. So, the start symbol S can expand to NT15 NTsomething, and then NT15 becomes t74.\n\nLooking at S's productions, one of them is S -> NT15 NT2, because in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> t74\n\nWait, let's check the rules again. Looking back, I see the rule NT15 -> 't74'. So yes, NT15 expands to t74. So one of the S productions is S -> NT15 NT2. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar for S includes S -> NT15 NT26.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t97 t23 t29 t62 t49 t18 t18 t59 t91 t69 t23 t78 t47 t86 t23 t78 t69 t29 t47 t26 t94 t78 t97 t62 t97` and I have to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. The grammar is pretty complex with a bunch of production rules, so I need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems all productions are either two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. So, each production step reduces the length of the string by one, as each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols.\n\nThe string has 23 tokens, which I assume are the terminals in the order they appear. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production starts with a single non-terminal and produces two symbols. The start symbol is S, which has several productions. Each of these productions starts with S and is followed by two non-terminals. So, the initial expansion would replace S with one of these two non-terminals, leading to a string that starts with those two non-terminals, each of which will then be replaced by two symbols in subsequent steps.\n\nGiven that the grammar is CNF, the number of steps needed to derive a string of length n (number of terminals) from the start symbol S is (n-1)\/2. Here, n is 5, since the string has 23 terminals? Wait, actually, the string is 23 tokens long. Let me count:\n\nt97, t23, t29, t62, t49, t18, t18, t59, t91, t69, t23, t78, t47, t86, t23, t78, t69, t29, t47, t26, t94, t78, t97, t62, t97. Wait, that's 25 tokens. Okay, 25 terminals. So the length is 25, which means the number of productions needed would be (25-1)\/2 = 12, since each production reduces the number of symbols by one.\n\nWait, no, the number of steps is n-1, but each step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so starting from 1 non-terminal, after k steps, we have 2^k non-terminals. But in this case, the string has 25 terminals, meaning that 2^k = 25, which isn't possible because 25 is not a power of 2. Hmm, that might indicate a problem, but perhaps the count is wrong. Let me recount the string:\n\nt97 (1), t23 (2), t29 (3), t62 (4), t49 (5), t18 (6), t18 (7), t59 (8), t91 (9), t69 (10), t23 (11), t78 (12), t47 (13), t86 (14), t23 (15), t78 (16), t69 (17), t29 (18), t47 (19), t26 (20), t94 (21), t78 (22), t97 (23), t62 (24), t97 (25). Yep, 25 terminals. So the length is 25, which is not a power of two, so perhaps there's a mistake in my assumption about how the derivation works.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with S, which needs to be expanded into two symbols, each of which is further expanded until we get all the terminals. So, if the string has 25 terminals, the number of non-terminals in the derivation must be such that 2^k >= 25, which would require k\u22485, since 2^5=32. But each expansion increases the count by 1, starting from 1 (S), so after k expansions, there are 1 + k non-terminals. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time. So starting from 1 (S), after 24 steps, we would have 25 terminals. That makes sense. So the derivation would take 24 steps, but in terms of the parsing tree, it's a full binary tree with 25 leaves, which is possible because 25 is odd. Wait, no, 25 is odd, so the tree can't be perfectly balanced, but it's still possible to have a derivation where some rules produce terminals at the same time as others.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating things. Instead, I should look at the string and see if it can be broken down into a series of productions starting from S.\n\nLooking at the first few terminals: t97, t23, t29, t62, t49, etc. I need to see if these can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S can produce several things, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which would start the string with t23 t24. Let me check the first two symbols in the string: t97 and t23. So t97 t23. Is there a production where the first non-terminal produces t97 and the second produces t23?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, let's see if any rule starts with a non-terminal that can derive t97.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which would give t9 and t5. Not matching t97 t23.\n\nOther productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 \u2192 t23 t24 (but the string starts with t97, so not matching).\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16 \u2192 t20 t16 (no, first is t20).\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3 \u2192 t17 t3.\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6 \u2192 t20 t6.\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5 \u2192 t9 t5.\n\nS \u2192 NT21 NT1 \u2192 t21 t1.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t97. Is t97 a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that some of the right-hand sides have terminals like 't49', 't91', etc. So 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So t97 is a terminal.\n\nWait, so if the first symbol is t97, then the first production must be a rule that starts with a non-terminal that can produce t97 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see:\n\nNT23 can produce t23, t62, t59, etc., but is there a rule where NT97 would produce t97? But in the given grammar, all the non-terminals' productions are given, but none of them have t97 as a terminal on the right-hand side except perhaps in some other rules. Wait, no, in the given list, the only terminals are 't49', 't18', 't59', 't91', 't69', 't23', 't78', 't47', 't86', 't29', 't62', 't94', 't78', 't97', 't62'.\n\nWait, the string includes t97, t23, t29, t62, t49, etc. So t97 is a terminal, as is t23, t29, t62, t49, etc.\n\nSo, for the first production step, we have S \u2192 X Y, where X \u2192 t97 and Y \u2192 something. But looking at the rules, none of the non-terminals on the left have X producing t97 directly. The only rules where X can produce t97 are those starting with NT23, NT25, etc.\n\nWait, let's look through all the productions for NTs:\n\nNT23 has a production NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, which then would produce more non-terminals. But perhaps there's a chain of productions that can lead to t97.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider that S can expand into any of its production rules. Let's consider all possible first steps.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 \u2192 So if S \u2192 NT23 NT24, then the first two symbols would be the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-420","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me see. The grammar is pretty long, with a lot of productions. The string provided is a sequence of terms like t62, t29, and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky normal form entails. I remember that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Oh wait, but looking at the given grammar, some productions end with a terminal and others with a non-terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT24 NT24 is two non-terminals, but others like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, that's two non-terminals as well. But I'm a bit confused because NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5, which is two non-terminals. Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules, trying to find a derivation that leads the string. Alternatively, I could build a parse tree or use some algorithm like recursive descent parsing. But given that the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can apply the CYK algorithm. Wait, does CYK require the grammar to be in CNF? Let me double-check. Yes, I think CYK is designed for CNF grammars because it uses a dynamic programming approach to fill a table for each possible substring, checking the possible non-terminals that can generate that substring. So maybe I can use CYK here.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, some of the productions have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like S \u2192 NT24 NT24, or NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. So in this case, all productions have at most two non-terminals, which aligns with CNF because in CNF, each production is at most two symbols. So it's okay. \n\nNow, for the string to be generated, each symbol in the string must be matched by a production. Let's see. The given string is: t62 t29 t92 t42 t23 t47 t92 t23 t23 t94 t1 t28 t1 t62 t29 t97 t59 t62 t59 t80 t26 t74 t28 t74 t21.\n\nFirst, I should map the terminals to actual values. Wait, in this grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For example, some rule like NT22 \u2192 't28' or NT23 \u2192 't49'. These are the base cases. So each non-terminal either produces a terminal or another non-terminal. \n\nWait a minute, to use CYK, I might need to first simplify the grammar to ensure that all terminal symbols are single characters. But here, they are written as 't49', which is presumably a terminal symbol, so the grammar is written with terminals as such. So when parsing, when we see a 't49', we can match it against the corresponding production. \n\nBut this string has multi-digit numbers as terminals, like t62, t29, etc. So first, I'll need to map these to actual terminal symbols or see if each is a separate terminal. Each 't' followed by two digits is a unique terminal symbol. So, for example, 't62' is one symbol, 't29' is another, and so on.\n\nWait, but considering the length, 6 digits might matter, but in this case, the terminals are up to t97, t80, etc., so each is two digits. So, each 't##' is a unique terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of such terminals. The idea is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nSince this is a bit complicated, maybe I can try to see if the parsing works step by step. Let me start by writing down the string:\n\nt62, t29, t92, t42, t23, t47, t92, t23, t23, t94, t1, t28, t1, t62, t29, t97, t59, t62, t59, t80, t26, t74, t28, t74, t21.\n\nWow, that's a long string. Let me count the number of symbols: 25 symbols.\n\nHmm. Wait, but considering the grammar, each step in the derivation combines two non-terminals into one, but since this is a linear string, it's a leftmost derivation, but perhaps a better approach is to use CYK.\n\nBut since CYK can handle it, let's proceed. Let me think about how to construct the CYK table. The CYK table is a 2D table where table[i][j] represents the set of non-terminals that can generate the substring from position i to j. Here, i and j are 0-based or 1-based, but it's easier to handle 1-based here.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to consider that each 't' is a terminal, and we can start by identifying which non-terminals produce each 't'. So, for each 't##', find which non-terminals A have a production A \u2192 't##'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, for example, NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5, which are non-terminals. But looking for terminal symbols, such as NT21 \u2192 't21', since NT21 is defined as producing 't21'. Wait no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, no: Let me check the given grammar again. Wait, the grammar is written in a certain way, so let me look for any 'a' symbols, like a terminal t followed by two digits. From the list, I see:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't42'\n\nWait, wait, hold on. No, looking at the grammar, I think some productions are shown as NT23 \u2192 't49'. Wait, the user included the grammar in a certain way, perhaps they have some rules that produce terminals, like 't##' symbols.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. Looking at the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT20 \u2192 NT24 NT24 \u2014 that's two non-terminals.\n\nOther rules: NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 \u2014 two non-terminals.\n\nBut then, for some NTs, like NT25, the rule is NT25 \u2192 't18' \u2014 so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar includes some terminals. So, I need to check each production to see if any right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT23 \u2192 't49'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT25 \u2192 't18'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n\nWait, so many of these non-terminals produce a single terminal. For example, NT20 \u2192 't97' (single terminal). Others like NT21 \u2192 't21', NT22 \u2192 't28', etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, each terminal is a single-character symbol only, right? For example, t62 is a terminal, t29 is a terminal, etc.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, in the given string, symbols like t62 are individual terminals? Or are they possible sequences? In this grammar, in the productions, some non-terminals produce sequences of other non-terminals, but the terminals are individual.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. In the given grammar, for each production on the right-hand side, it's either terminals or non-terminals. So each production is a combination of terms. The string provided contains a sequence of 't##' symbols, each being a single terminal. So each 't##' is a separate terminal symbol.\n\nSo the string is 25 symbols, each being"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-437","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens: t21 t80 t26 t59 t47 t26 t21 t29 t82 t62 t1 t82 t92 t62 t49 t49 t80 t97 t91 t69 t74 t80 t18 t80 t80 t42. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF looks like. CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, or a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. So, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S and has multiple productions. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals, which are then further broken down until terminals are reached. For instance, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, but wait, that's three symbols. Hmm, that seems off because CNF should have only two symbols on each side. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see S has productions like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three non-terminals. That can't be right for CNF. CNF requires productions to have only two non-terminals on the right. So perhaps this is a mistake, or maybe the grammar was misformulated. Alternatively, maybe the original question had a typo, and indeed it should have two symbols each time, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24, or S \u2192 NT23 NT5.\n\nWait, looking again, I see in the productions that S is split into two parts each time, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So maybe the longer productions were mistyped in the question. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5 is incorrect because it's a single production with three non-terminals. So I think that's a mistake, and perhaps it should be something like S \u2192 NT23 NT5, but in this case, the answer might not be correct as the grammar is not in proper CNF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended it to be multiple steps. But for now, I'll proceed assuming that each production only splits into two non-terminals, as per CNF. I'll need to check each production to make sure it fits that structure.\n\nNow, the string is a series of tokens starting with 't21', 't80', etc. The terminals here are the t21, t26, t80, etc., which are presumably terminal symbols, while the NT symbols like NT23, NT24, etc., are non-terminals that need to be expanded into terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I can try to parse the string step by step, decomposing it according to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start from the top and see if the string can be broken down. The first token is 't21', which suggests that one of the productions starts with NT21. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n\nThen, 't80' would need to come from NT80, but in the grammar, there's NT28 \u2192 NT80. So perhaps 't80' comes from NT28.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t21 t80 t26 t59 t47 t26 t21 t29 t82 t62... So after t21, t80, t26, t59, t47, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string as a sequence of steps. Let me consider the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S step by step.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so maybe it's better to see if the grammar can connect the tokens in a way that the entire string is covered.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string's sequence of terminals and non-terminals can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to check for each pair of terminals and see if they can be generated by the same production.\n\nWait, starting with the first part:\n\nThe string starts with 't21 t80 t26 t59 t47 t26 t21 t29 t82 t62...'\n\nSo first, t21 comes from NT21. Let's see what NT21 produces.\n\nFrom the grammar: NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9.\n\nNow, 't80' is from NT28, so NT28 \u2192 NT80.\n\nBut how do we connect NT21 and NT28? The production must connect these. Let's see if there's a production where NT21 and NT28 are on the left side.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see a production that starts with NT21 or NT28 on the left. So perhaps the way the string starts might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see the entire sequence and if there are enough productions connecting the parts.\n\nWait, the string also has other tokens like t26, t59, t47, etc.\n\nLooking at the NT26 \u2192 NT8NT23, which then can further expand.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I need to make a parsing tree step by step, but given the length, it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if each terminal in the string is either directly derivable or can be split correctly according to the grammar's productions.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps it's better to just attempt a top-down parsing.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Let's check if NT23 and NT24 can generate the string.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. Then NT5 is t5, but here we have t26 first. That might not match. Alternatively, maybe there's another production for NT23.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT23 appears in several productions, like \u2192 NT5 NT25, \u2192 NT6 NT9, \u2192 NT9 NT4, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the first parts. The first token is t21, so perhaps that's part of NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can produce a longer chain that includes t21, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that each production in the grammar has exactly two non-terminals, so when expanding, each step splits into two parts.\n\nTo generate the string, perhaps I can see if each pair of consecutive terminals can be matched by some production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, for example, the first pair is t21 and t80. So if a production starts with NT21 producing NT80, but checking the grammar, I don't see any production where the right-hand side starts with NT21 and ends with NT80.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple steps. For example, NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9, then NT10 \u2192 NT19 NT12, etc. But it's getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the string is given, perhaps there are tokens that can't be matched because they don't follow the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t21 t80 t26 t59 t47 t26 t21 t29 t82 t62...\n\nWait, considering the first few tokens after t21, t80, but since NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9, producing t21 would require NT21 to generate the first t21, and the next symbol would come from NT9. But does that fit with t80? Probably not, so perhaps the initial split isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start production is different. For example, S could produce something else that starts with t21 and t80, but from the grammar, I don't see a production where the left side is NT21 and the right includes t80.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string contains terminal symbols that cannot all be generated by the given grammar. For example, some of the tokens might not have allowed productions or might require a production that isn't present.\n\nBut without a full parse, it's hard to be certain, but perhaps I can spot inconsistencies. For example, the string contains multiple t26 and t47, which are non-terminals in the grammar. Let's see what t26 produces.\n\nLooking the grammar: NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT23, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, etc. So t26 would eventually expand into a series of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut without seeing any token beyond t47, t47 might be another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see NT47 being defined.

Yes, there's a 't78'. Looking through the terminal rules, is there any rule that produces 't78'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule that outputs 't78'. The closest is NT9 -> 't78', right? Let's confirm. Yes, NT9 -> 't78' is a rule in the grammar. So, 't78' is produced by NT9.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the string is a sequence of terminals. To see if it's in the language, each terminal must be the result of some production.\n\nSo, 't59' comes from NT17.\n\n't47' comes from NT2.\n\n't69' comes from NT something. Wait, looking back, there's no NT rule that directly produces 't69'. Hmm, this is a problem. Because in the list, I don't see any rule that produces 't69'. So, that might mean that the string is invalid because 't69' is not directly a terminal of any non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't69' is derived from some non-terminal that expands into it. But looking through the entire grammar, I don't see any NT that produces 't69'. NT19 -> 't6 NT29', which is 't6t29', but that would not result in 't69' directly. Similarly, other NT rule productions don't generate 't69'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, every production seems to follow that structure. \n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminal symbols, some of which might correspond to non-terminals. My goal is to see if there's a derivation starting from the start symbol S and ending with this string.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t42 t29 t74 t78 t97 t29 t78 t78 t82 t26 t26 t28 t21 t59 t29 t21 t74 t50 t42 t91 t78 t69 t1 t78 t1 t92 t94`.\n\nI notice that some of these look like non-terminals, like t42, t29, etc., but others are terminals if they don't correspond to any non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some parts end up as 't' followed by numbers, which might be terminals or results of reductions. I need to check which are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see references like NT23, NT5, etc., which are non-terminals. The strings end with 't' followed by numbers, like t42, t29, etc. It seems these are actual terminal symbols because they don't appear on the left-hand side of any production as a non-terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the string, replacing non-terminals with their possible right-hand sides and seeing if the sequence can be constructed. \n\nStarting with the first symbol, t42. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 -> t1 when S is derived, but wait, let me check again. Wait, actually, in the last set of productions, NT24 -> t1, and S -> NT24 NT5. So, t42 might correspond to a non-terminal that expands to t42... Or maybe t42 is a terminal symbol that's part of the string. But in the given grammar, I don't see t42 as a terminal; instead, non-terminals expand to other non-terminals or sometimes to a single terminal, like NT30 -> NT3 NT1, but I see that some non-terminals directly go to terminals like t42.\n\nWait, looking back, I think in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal string, like NT23 -> t49 or others like that. So, t42 is a terminal symbol. So, I need to see which production leads to that.\n\nHmm, okay, let's approach this by trying to build the string from the start symbol S. Since the string is quite long, I'll have to go step by step.\n\nS can produce one of the four options: NT24 NT5, NT20 NT16, NT17 NT3, NT20 NT6, NT9 NT5.\n\nLet's try expanding each step.\n\nOption 1: S -> NT24 NT5.\n\nNT24 can produce: Looking at the grammar, NT24 -> NT5 NT19 (from multiple rules) and also NT24 -> t1. So, t42 could come from NT24 -> t1 if 1 corresponds to t42? Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look back at the string and match each part.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string as a series of non-terminals and terminals and see if they can be derived.\n\nBut since the string has all terminals (as per the initial analysis), each symbol in the string must be a terminal, meaning each must be the result of a single-step derivation from a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals do have rules ending with 't...', such as NT23 -> t49, NT15 -> t50, NT2 -> t94, etc. So, for instance, if the string has t42, we need to see which non-terminal directly produces t42. Scanning the rules, I don't immediately see a rule like NTx -> t42. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT2 -> t94, but I don't see any rule ending with t42. So maybe t42 is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded further. That would complicate things because the string has t42 as a terminal, which would mean the grammar must have a production where a non-terminal directly produces t42. If that's not the case, then perhaps the string isn't derivable.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some rules. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT24 -> t1 and other rules, but not t42. Also, other productions end with t49, t74, t78, etc. So there's no rule that directly gives t42 as a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem because if the string has t42, it must have come from a non-terminal that directly produces t42, which doesn't exist here. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I might have overlooked some rules. Let me search for 't42' in the grammar. Oh, here we go: Looking back at the list, I see NT25 -> t30 NT11. Not t42. Let me check all the rules. Hmm, I can't find any production that results in t42 as a terminal. This would mean that t42 is not present in the language of the grammar, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It looks like a bunch of non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol seems to be S, as there are productions starting with S. The grammar has various non-terminals like NT23, NT3, S, and so on. Each production leads closer to terminals until we get 't' terms.\n\nLooking at the string, each segment after the initial 't's starts with 't29', 't62', etc., which suggests that the string is built from multiple non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nI'll try to parse the string as a sequence of productions. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nStarting with the first token, 't29'. I need to see if any production starts with NT23 (since earlier rules have NT23 -> NT5 NT25 and NT5 -> other things, but 't29' is a terminal, so the non-terminal that ends with 't29' must be resolved.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT23 -> NT4 NT23 and NT23 -> NT27 NT16. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar I provided, under NT23, it's `NT23 -> NT5 NT25`, among others. Hmm, actually, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, I see some rules like NT23 -> NT6 NT9 and NT23 -> NT11 NT1. Hmm, but the 't's are terminals. Let me look for any NT that directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice some terminals: NT6 -> NT17 NT3, NT17 -> NT19 NT2, and so on. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, I see things like NT5 -> 't26' and others like NT2 -> 't94', NT18 -> 't92', etc. Oh right, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT5 -> 't26', which would produce 't26', and similarly NT7 -> 't82', NT1 -> 't30', etc. I think the key is to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, I have 't29', which would correspond to a non-terminal that produces 't29'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT29 -> NT29 NT30 and NT29 -> NT7 NT8. Also, NT30 -> NT10 NT22 and NT23 -> NT23 NT21, etc. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, it's 't29' and 't86', etc. Let me check for any non-terminals that produce 't29'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT22 -> 't28', NT28 -> 't80', etc. Wait, perhaps 't29' is produced by NT29, but I don't see a production where NT29 directly becomes 't'. Alternatively, perhaps after some expansions, it becomes a 't'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see the sequence of non-terminals that build up to the string. Since this can get complicated, maybe it's easier to reconstruct a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' token in the string represents a single terminal, and the non-terminals in between are the chain of productions that expand to these terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to represent each token as a step in the derivation. For example, 't29' might be the result of a certain NT29.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I find that NT30 -> 't80' and some other productions, but not 't29'. Wait, perhaps NT23 -> 't23' somewhere? Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are several instances where non-terminals directly produce a 't'. For example:\n\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT23 -> 't16' when in NT17 -> NT19 NT2, but that's not directly 't'.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't29' isn't directly a production. Wait, looking again, I see NT23 has a production NT23 -> 't16' as part of another rule, but not directly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from several non-terminals, each expanding into multiple 't's. For example, 't29 t62 t47 t92...' might correspond to a sequence of NT29 producing 't29', then another NT that produces 't62', and so on.\n\nBut without a clear path, I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but considering the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be formed by starting with S and expanding step by step. Let's try to think of possible derivations.\n\nStarting with S, it can produce various options, but each production is a pair of non-terminals. For example, S -> NT23 NT24 NT23 (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the first production is S -> NT23 NT24 NT23, but I think that's incorrect because the original grammar had S -> NT23 NT24 NT23? Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar, the user provided the first set as S -> NT23 NT24 NT23? Wait, the initial grammar was presented as a list, perhaps with line breaks. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial context, the user provided the grammar as a multi-line list. So the first production is S -> NT23 NT24 NT23? Or S -> NT23 NT24 NT23. Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar, it's S -> NT23 NT24 NT23? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial grammar starts with:\n\n```\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT23\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n...\n```\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the initial problem statement, the grammar is:\n\n- S followed by NT23 NT24 NT23, then S followed by NT23 NT20 NT16, etc. Wait, perhaps I misread. Actually, no, the initial lines after the given string under the grammar are the non-terminals, so each line is a production for the non-terminal name before the '->'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let me restate: The grammar is given in a list where each entry is a non-terminal followed by '->', then the production. So, looking at the initial lines:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT23\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n- ...\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me check: Each line starts with the non-terminal, then '->', then the production. So, for example, the first production is non-terminal NT23 -> NT5 NT25, since the line starts with 'NT23 -> NT5 NT25'. Similarly, the second line starts with 'NT20 -> NT24 NT23' etc. So S has several productions, each being a sequence of non-terminals. \n\nWait, no, looking back, the first few lines are S followed by various combinations, which makes me think that S has several productions, each consisting of multiple non-terminals. So each production starting with S is something like S -> NT23 NT24 NT23.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Because, in Chomsky normal form, each production of S should be a single non-terminal, because S is the start symbol. But here, in the grammar, each production for S has multiple non-terminals, which is not standard. Because in ChNF, the start symbol S also should produce a single non-terminal. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misparsing the grammar structure.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The string we're checking is all terminals, so that's a good sign.\n\nThe string is: `t28 t62 t62 t80 t18 t1 t47 t82 t42 t78 t1 t21 t69 t92 t80 t92 t21 t94 t50 t23 t42 t82 t23 t59 t59 t78 t97 t47`.\n\nSo, it's a sequence of terminals. The non-terminals in the grammar are things like S, NT23, NT30, etc. The terminals in the string are numbers, but in the grammar, I see production rules where the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT5, where NT23 and NT5 are non-terminals, but after that, when these non-terminals produce terminals, that leads to the string.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to try to parse the string by recursively breaking it down into parts according to the grammar. Starting with the first symbol, which is 't28'. I'll see which production can start with 't28'. Looking at the grammar, I see production rules like NT15 \u2192 't50', NT24 \u2192 't1', etc. Wait, perhaps I need to look for production rules that have terminals on the RHS.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t28, so the first production must generate t28. Let's see: the rule NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18. So if I have NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, and then each of those non-terminals needs to produce terminals. So t28 is generated by NT28, which goes to NT20 NT18.\n\nSo for the first t28, I can represent it as NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18. Now, I need to see if the remaining string after t28 can be generated by the sequence NT20 NT18.\n\nSo breaking the string down step by step:\n\n1. t28: produced by NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\nRemaining string after t28: t62 t62 t80 t18 t1 t47 t82 t42 t78 t1 t21 t69 t92 t80 t92 t21 t94 t50 t23 t42 t82 t23 t59 t59 t78 t97 t47\n\nNow, the first part of this remaining string is t62. Let's find which production rule starts with t62.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3, but that's not t62. Then, NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26, which starts with t8. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some of the non-terminals have terminal labels. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' (a terminal symbol)\n- NT2 \u2192 't94' (terminal)\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT23 \u2192 't42'\n- NT17 \u2192 't59'\n- NT3 \u2192 't25'? Wait, no, the rule is NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25, so that's non-terminal. But in the string, we have t25? Wait, no, I see a rule NT7 \u2192 't82', but in the string, the part is t62, which isn't in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check each rule for terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT20 (non-terminals)\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' (terminal)\n- NT2 \u2192 't94' (terminal)\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (terminal)\n- NT22 \u2192 't28' (terminal)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (non-terminals)\n- NT17 \u2192 't59' (terminal)\n- NT8 \u2192 't91' (terminal)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1' (terminal)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18 (non-terminals)\n- NT2 \u2192 't94' (terminal)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26 (non-terminals)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3 (non-terminals)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24 (non-terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (non-terminals)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT22 (non-terminals)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7 (non-terminals)\n- NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11 (non-terminals)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4 (non-terminals)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1 (non-terminals)\n- NT14 \u2192 NT26 NT17 (non-terminals)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT29 NT2 (non-terminals)\n- NT15 \u2192 't74' (terminal)\n- ...\n- Hmm, after checking all the rules, it looks like the only terminals are specific numbers, but in the grammar, some rules end with terminal symbols. So, for example, NT24 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, the string contains t1, t26, etc. So let's go back.\n\nSo in the first step, after t28, the next is t62. Looking for production rules that can produce t62. Let's scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at each rule, I don't see any direct production for t62. For example, NT6 \u2192 't17' and 't3' (from two different rules), but not t62. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 't8' and 't26', etc. Wait, none of the rules directly produce t62. So maybe the string can't be derived from this grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the t62 could be generated from another production. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused t62 with another number. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me enumerate the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where RHS ends with t62. Let's see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT26 \u2192 't8' or 't26' (from NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26)\n- NT7 \u2192 't82' (terminal)\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n\nNone of these produce t62. So if the string starts with t28, and then t62, and we can't find a production for t62, then this string is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt28 t62 t62 t80 t18 t1 t47 t82 t42 t78 t1 t21 t69 t92 t80 t92 t21 t94 t50 t23 t42 t82 t23 t59 t59 t78 t97 t47.\n\nSo t28 is first, followed by t62 twice, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and t28 is generated by some other production that could have intermediate steps which can produce t62.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not starting correctly. Let's consider each production step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second t28 (after the first t28) is generated by NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18 again, which could be further broken down, but that might not necessarily produce t62.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect because the string has t62, which is not a terminal in any production's immediate RHS.\n\nWait, maybe I need to construct the parse tree in a way that each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that when expanded, matches the string symbol by symbol.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nWe start with the string: t28 t62 t62 t80 t18 t1 t47 t82 t42 t78 t1 t21 t69 t92 t80 t92 t21 t94 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and S appears on the left-hand side of a few production rules, like S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So, the string must eventually derive from these NT symbols leading down to terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe given string is: `t18 t69 t80 t1 t28 t28 t28 t23 t21 t1 t50 t29 t91 t80 t82 t26 t23 t62 t62 t42 t80 t49 t94 t1 t49 t86 t21 t23`.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't18', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals produce 't' symbols. For example, NT15 \u2192 't50', NT2 \u2192 't47', NT5 \u2192 't26', and others. So, I need to see if any of these non-terminals can produce the corresponding 't' sequences.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string into parts. The first few tokens are t18, t69, t80, t1, t28, t28, t28. I need to see how these could have been produced by non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT15 \u2192 't50', but that's a single terminal. But other non-terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't47' (multiple times), so t2 might come from NT2. Similarly, NT18 \u2192 't92', but that's not present here. Wait, let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't12' (from S? Wait, no\u2014I need to check all the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider how the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar productions.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a series of nodes that must reduce according to the grammar's productions.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to see if the string can be split into a sequence of non-terminals that can derive down to the terminals given.\n\nGiven that the string is 27 tokens long, I'll need to see how the non-terminals can produce this.\n\nBut let's look at the first token, t18. Is there a production for 't18'? Looking through the grammar, yes: NT18 \u2192 't92'. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t18, not t92. Hmm, that suggests that either I mixed up the NT names or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no\u2014the productions in the grammar are for the non-terminals. So, for example, NT18 is a non-terminal that can produce 't92'. So the string starts with t18, which might be a result of NT18 \u2192 't92'? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because NT18 is a non-terminal, but in the string, we have t18 as a terminal. So perhaps I have to find a non-terminal NT that can derive into t18.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT20 \u2192 't97', NT12 \u2192 't29', NT7 \u2192 't82', NT17 \u2192 't19', NT5 \u2192 't26', etc. Wait, I'm not seeing a production for t18. Hmm, is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the grammar wrong. Let me go through the entire grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT15: 't50'\n\nNT2: 't47'\n\nNT5: 't26'\n\nNT20: 't97'\n\nNT18: 't92'\n\nWait, wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought there was no production for t18, but in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't92'. So t92 is a terminal, but in the string, I have t18 as a token. So this suggests that t18 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT18 produces 't92', not 't18'. Therefore, that part of the string, t18, cannot be produced directly by any non-terminal in the grammar. Unless I'm missing a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in parsing the grammar. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n\nYes, that's correct. So t92 is the only one. Therefore, the string contains 't18', which isn't produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it includes a terminal that no non-terminal can derive into.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe some non-terminals can combine to produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal going to two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is supposed to be generated by a series of these steps. Therefore, each 't' in the string must come directly from a non-terminal production where the non-terminal is replaced by that 't'.\n\nBut since in the grammar, no non-terminal produces 't18', the string must be invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial parsing. Let me double-check the grammar to see if any non-terminal produces t18.\n\nLooking back:\n\n- The non-terminals and their productions are as follows (from the provided grammar):\n\nNT2 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\n\nI don't see any non-terminal that produces t18, t29, etc. Therefore, the string includes 't18', which is not possible to derive from any non-terminal in the grammar. Thus, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it consists of a starting symbol S and several non-terminal symbols that break down into terminals and other non-terminals. Some non-terminals produce specific strings of terminals. I notice that the grammar includes rules like NT1 -> NT0 NT3 and so on, but also some non-terminals that directly lead to terminal strings, such as NT2 -> 't47' and others.\n\nThe given string is a series of terminal symbols without any spaces, so it's a concatenation of various 't' followed by numbers. My initial thought is that I need to see if the production rules of the grammar can derive this string.\n\nI should probably start by analyzing the structure of the string. The string is quite long, so manually tracing each step might be cumbersome. Maybe I can find patterns or decompose the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, like NT23 -> 't82', NT15 -> 't50', and others. So, I can check if the string can be broken down into these terminals, following the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list some of the non-terminals that produce terminals:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't82'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT29 \u2192 't29' (Wait, that's a rule like NT29 -> NT29 NT30 but another rule says NT29 -> NT29 NT30, but in the string, there are 't29's. Or, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see NT29 -> NT29 NT30, so that's a recursive rule until it hits NT30 which becomes 't29').\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, in the grammar:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't82'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because some lines have NTxxx -> some terminals, like NT23 -> 't82'. So these are production rules where the non-terminal expands directly into a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo for the string, I can scan through and see if each segment corresponds to such a production. Let's take the string:\n\nt82 t50 t86 t23 t47 t29 t59 t78 t21 t49 t82 t97 t62 t92 t78 t29 t78 t26 t47 t80 t94 t26 t50 t23 t91 t28 t62 t59 t1\n\nBreaking it down into segments:\n\nt82, t50, t86, t23, t47, t29, t59, t78, t21, t49, t82, t97, t62, t92, t78, t78, t29, t78, t26, t47, t80, t94, t26, t50, t23, t91, t28, t62, t59, t1.\n\nEach of these should correspond to a production in the grammar. Let's map them to the grammar:\n\nt82: Could be NT23 or NT27 or others. Wait, looking at NT23's rules, one of them is NT23 -> 't82'. So t82 would come from NT23.\n\nt50: NT15 -> 't50'.\n\nt86: Hmm, looking at the grammar, NT30 -> 't86' because NT30 -> NT3 NT1, but NT3 and NT1 are another set. Wait, no, wait, NT30 can also be transformed into t86. Let me check: NT30 -> 't86' is a rule. Because in the grammar, I see NT30 \u2192 't86' as one of the rules.\n\nt23: NT23 is already mapped to t82, but here we have t23. Looking at the grammar, is there a rule that produces t23? Yes, NT26 -> 't23', because in the rules, NT26 \u2192 't23'.\n\nt47: NT2 \u2192 't47'.\n\nt29: NT12 \u2192 't29'.\n\nt59: NT16 -> 't59' because the grammar has NT16 \u2192 't59'.\n\nt78: NT9 -> 't78'.\n\nt21: NT21 \u2192 't21'.\n\nt49: Hmm, t49. I don't see a direct production for t49 in the grammar. Looking at the rules, perhaps it's produced by some other non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal. Wait, looking further, I see NT27 \u2192 't49' because in the rules, NT27 -> 't49'.\n\nt82 again: NT23.\n\nt97: NT20 -> 't97'.\n\nt62: NT2 -> 't62'.\n\nt92: NT18 -> 't92'.\n\nt78 again: NT9 \u2192 't78'.\n\nt78 again: same as above.\n\nt29: same as before, NT12 \u2192 't29'.\n\nt78: same.\n\nt26: Hmm, t26. Checking the rules, is there a production for t26? There's NT26 -> 't23', but t26 itself is another terminal? Or perhaps it's derived from a non-terminal that produces it. Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NT26 \u2192 't26' directly. So maybe t26 isn't directly a production, but perhaps from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back. The rules have NT26 in several places:\n\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26: Wait, that's a left recursion. So perhaps that's a way to generate strings ending with certain terminals, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, looking for NT26, I also have NT26 -> 't23' and NT26 -> 't69' (from NT26 -> 't69'). But I don't see any direct rules for t26. So perhaps t26 is a terminal, but in the grammar, it's actually a non-terminal that can only expand into other non-terminals. Wait, that's possible. So if t26 is a non-terminal, then how does the string have t26 as a terminal? It can't, unless it's produced by a non-terminal that eventually produces 't26'. But looking through, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal goes directly to 't26', except for possibly NT26 \u2192 't23' or 't69'. So that's confusing because t26 is treated as a terminal here in the string, but in the grammar, it's a non-terminal that can only expand into other non-terminals or terminals like 't23' and 't69'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me re-check the grammar provided. Looking specifically at the rules for NT26:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- Also, NT26 -> NT8 NT26.\n\nBut the string includes 't26'. There's no production that includes 't26' as a terminal, so perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe 't26' is a typo and it should be 't23' or 't69', but since it's present, the string might not be part of the language.\n\nWait, but the string has 't26' as a terminal. So if the grammar doesn't have any rule where a non-terminal can produce 't26', then the string cannot be part of the language.

{"custom_id":"request-466","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string, and I need to determine whether the string is generated by the grammar. The grammar is quite complex with various production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens like 't62', 't47', etc. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky normal form entails. From what I remember, Chomsky normal form is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. It ensures that the grammar is either unit productions, chaining of two non-terminals, or terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, all production rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal symbol followed by another non-terminal. So, it fits Chomsky normal form. That's a good start because it aligns with the structure I can handle.\n\nThe string provided is `t62 t47 t69 t59 t21 t21 t91 t92 t23 t47 t23 t1 t92 t47 t82 t28 t47 t49 t91 t23 t59 t21 t47 t1 t92 t62 t94 t86 t92`. It's a sequence that starts with 't62' and ends with 't92', with various tokens in between.\n\nSince each rule in Chomsky normal form either produces a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two non-terminals, the parse tree for the string should consist of a series of these rules. However, each production is two symbols, so the string length should correspond to the number of production steps. Let me count the tokens in the string. There are 32 tokens, which implies 16 production steps if each step produces one terminal and one non-terminal. But wait, in Chomsky normal form, each production is two symbols, so for a string of length n, the number of productions would be n-1. Wait, no, that's for the parsing steps. Actually, the length of the string is equal to the number of terminals derived, and each production contributes one terminal and one non-terminal at a time. So, for a string of m terminals, the derivation length would be m.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the fact that each production rule either ends with a terminal and a non-terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, each step in the parsing reduces the number of non-terminals by one. The initial string should be transformed into the start symbol S through a series of productions that expand non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps I should try to parse the string starting from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't62 t47...', which suggests that the derivation begins with the start symbol S producing a sequence that starts with these terminals. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at the grammar rules to see how terminals are generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several rules where non-terminals produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal or a terminal. For example, NT23 -> NT5 t62. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, I see rules like S -> NT24 NT24, NT24 NT5, etc. Wait, but in the given grammar, I need to see which non-terminals produce terminals followed by something.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, a lot of them are two non-terminals, except some have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT23 -> NT5 t62? No, wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 t62? No, actually, for example, NT23 -> NT27 t49, as per the given grammar. Similarly, NT15 -> NT23 t21, and so on. So, each rule where a non-terminal produces something ends with a terminal followed by another non-terminal, or perhaps directly a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see a few examples:\n\nS -> NT24 NT24, so this would expand into a non-terminal and another non-terminal.\n\nBut another rule is S -> NT20 NT16, which are both non-terminals.\n\nThen there's rule NT23 -> NT5 t62? No, looking at the given grammar, I need to find all the production rules that produce terminals followed by non-terminals. Let me go through some rules:\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT11, which is two non-terminals. That's not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find any production rules where a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal symbol followed by another non-terminal. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT27 t49 (end with a terminal and a non-terminal)\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT2 -> t94\n\nWait, that's a terminal (t94). But looking at the grammar as given, I might have misread some parts. Wait, let me read some carefully. The given grammar includes:\n\nNT2 -> t94\n\nIs this a production? The user listed a production like:\n\nWait, the initial grammar given starts with S and includes rules such as S->NT24 NT24, etc. Then there's a section listing all NTx -> something, including some with t.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT23 -> NT27 t49\n\nWhich implies that NT23 produces NT27 followed by 't49'.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 -> t94.\n\nSo, NT2 can directly produce a terminal 't94'. Similarly, other non-terminals may produce terminals followed by non-terminals.\n\nBut then the string provided starts with 't62 t47 t69...', so 't62' must be produced by a non-terminal that can derive 't62'.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals and their production rules, I need to find which NT can produce 't62' followed by something.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT20 -> t97, so 't97' is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at all the NTx rules, let's list the ones that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> NT27 t49\n\nSo, NT23 produces 't49' followed by NT27.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the production is NT23 -> NT5 NT25? Or is it NT23->NT5 NT25...\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

{"custom_id":"request-470","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume represent the terminal symbols. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and the structure. Since it's in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for possibly the start symbol on the right side, which can have two terminals. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions are S \u2192 NT23 NT5 or similar, where NT followed by a number is a non-terminal. Each non-terminal eventually breaks down into terminals, but some involve other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t94, t94, t74, t18, etc., totaling 31 tokens. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived by expanding the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by checking key non-terminals that produce t94 because the string starts with two t94s. Looking at the production rules, I see that S can produce NT5 NT23. So perhaps one of the t94s is from NT23 \u2192 t26, and another way to get t94 is through NT2 \u2192 t94. Wait, looking back, in the production rules, NT23 \u2192 t26 is there, and NT2 \u2192 t94 is also present. So, to get t94, it's either from NT23 or NT5.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, the rule NT2 \u2192 t94 exists. So, if I have t94, it can come from NT2. Alternatively, if I have t26, it comes from NT23. But both could contribute depending on how the string branches.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by seeing where it could fit. Since the first token is t94, and the last token is t94 as well. The string seems to have a symmetric pattern, which might suggest a balanced or symmetrical expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up in a way where a certain non-terminal is expanded multiple times. Since the string is long, it might involve several levels of expansion.\n\nI'll start by considering that the string is generated by a series of steps expanding S into NT23 and NT5. Each of those might then expand into other non-terminals, eventually producing the sequence of t's.\n\nAnother approach is to check the count of certain non-terminals or terminals. Each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals in the parse tree would be one less than the number of symbols, except for the start symbol.\n\nWait, but the string is a series of terminal symbols, so each symbol in the string must be a result of a terminal production. So, each step in the derivation must result in terminal symbols until the entire string is covered.\n\nI'll focus on the first few tokens. The first token is t94. Since NT2 \u2192 t94, that could be the origin. Alternatively, if it's from NT23 \u2192 t26, but then t26 is a terminal. But looking at the production rules, is NT23 producing t26?\n\nYes, the rule NT23 \u2192 t26 exists. So, if t94 comes from NT23, that would mean another NT23 is involved? Or no, because NT23 can also produce t26. Wait, let me confirm. The starting rule for S is S \u2192 NT23 NT5. So, if both NT23 and NT5 are expanded into t26 and t94, respectively, that would give t26 t94. But the string starts with t94, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait no, perhaps S is expanded into NT23 and NT5, and then each of those is further expanded. So for the first token t94, perhaps it's from NT5, which expands to t94. But how to get the next t94?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first NT23 is expanded into t26, and another NT23 is generated. But in the string, after t94 t94, the third token is t74, which would need to come from somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two t94 come from NT2 \u2192 t94 each, so S \u2192 NT2 NT5, but wait, the starting production is S \u2192 NT23 NT5, not NT2. So the root is S \u2192 NT23 NT5. So, that would give the first token from either NT23 or NT5.\n\nBut the string starts with t94, so it's either NT23 \u2192 t26 or NT5 (if there's a production for NT5 to t94). Looking back at the rules, no, I don't see NT5 expanding to t94. Instead, NT2 is the one that produces t94, and I don't see NT5 directly producing a terminal. Wait, maybe NT5 is part of another rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where NT5 directly expands into t94. Instead, the rule for NT2 is NT2 \u2192 t94, and the rule for NT5 is something like NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8. So NT5 can't produce t94 directly. So, the first t94 must come from NT2, which suggests that either NT23 or NT5 must somehow produce another NT2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT23 NT5. So both NT23 and NT5 are starting symbols. So, for the string, each NT23 and NT5 will expand into their respective productions, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut the first token is t94, so one of NT23 or NT5 must resolve to t94. But looking at the productions, NT23 \u2192 t26 is a terminal, and NT2 is the only one that directly expands to t94. But in this case, NT23 doesn't expand to t94 directly. So perhaps the first t94 comes from NT23 expanding into something that eventually produces t94, but I don't see NT23 having any rules that lead to t94.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. For NT23, it's expanding to t26. Then, from t26, maybe another NT23 is generated, which again expands to t26, but that doesn't give t94. So, perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial rule is S \u2192 NT23 NT5, so each of these can generate either a terminal or a non-terminal. The first step would be to see how NT23 and NT5 expand, leading to the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nBut since the first symbol is t94, let's see where that could come from. If the first NT23 produces t94, then let's check the rules for NT23. Looking back, I don't see any rules for NT23 expanding into t94. However, there's a rule NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT26. NT5, if it expands into t94, that might do it. Alternatively, maybe NT26 can produce t94.\n\nWait, the rules show that NT26 \u2192 NT10 NT23, and NT10 can produce t27, etc. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree step by step, expanding non-terminals until I reach the terminals.\n\nBut given the string length, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string is invalid because certain productions don't line up.\n\nAnother approach is to notice that each production in CNF produces exactly two non-terminals. So, starting from S, each step doubles the number of symbols, but when a non-terminal is a terminal, that's a leaf. For a string of length n, the number of non-terminals would be n-1.\n\nThe given string has 31 tokens, so there would be 30 productions from the start symbol, but since each production splits into two, the depth could vary. However, this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for repeating patterns or tokens that must come from specific rules. The string starts with two t94s, which might suggest that somewhere, a rule produces t94 twice, or that a non-terminal expands into two t94s.\n\nBut checking the rules, no rule directly expands a non-terminal into two t94s. So that suggests that maybe the first t94 is from NT2 (which produces t94) and the second t94 is from another NT2. But that would require expanding two NT2s, which in turn must somehow produce t94.\n\nHowever, NT2 only directly becomes t94, and all other productions of NT2 go through other non-terminals. So, unless NT23 or another non-terminal expands into NT2, which would produce t94. Wait, looking at the rules, is there a production where another non-terminal expands into NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by looking at the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has several production rules, and the start symbol is S. The string to check is a sequence of tokens ending with 't29'. All tokens in the string are of the form 'tX' or single symbols like 't1', 't2', etc., except for a few which are actual letters, like 't29', 't91', etc. Wait, actually, looking closer, 't49', 't50', etc., are treated as terminals, but in the grammar, there are other terminals like 't47', 't21', 't86', 't80', 't23', etc. Wait, but in the string, some tokens are 't47' or 't86', so they must be part of the derivation.\n\nWait, the string is: `t29 t91 t28 t91 t86 t23 t94 t50 t74 t26 t18 t28 t92 t29 t1 t47 t21 t86 t86 t42 t92 t21 t59 t92 t49 t86 t78 t28 t23 t74`\n\nSo all tokens are either 't...' or single-letter strings? No, wait, the string is written as individual tokens separated by spaces. So each token is either a 'tN' or a letter?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some productions lead to terminals like 't49', 't23', etc. Others are non-terminals. So the string is made up of these tokens.\n\nBut let me check: in the grammar, NT23 can produce 't49', and NT15 produces 't50', etc. So any production that ends in NT followed by something that produces a terminal is part of the string.\n\nThe approach is to trace back from the string to see if it can be derived from S using the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (each production is either A -> BC or A -> a), the string must be a sequence of a's, b's, c's, etc., where the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, which eventually expand into a's.\n\nBut let me look at the string: all tokens are tN, which correspond to the grammar's terminals, except some are letters. Wait, no, the grammar includes terminals like 't49', 't50', etc., but I'm not sure if 't29' is a terminal or derived from some non-terminal. Wait, wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal. For example, NT23 -> 't49', so 't49' is a terminal. Similarly, NT1 -> 't47', so 't47' is a terminal.\n\nIn the string, the tokens include 't29', which is one of the terminals. So the string consists of these terminals and other 't's, which are also terminals.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string as a sequence of these terminals, and see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nParsing such a string can be done using a recursive descent approach, but it's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for possible parse trees.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can split it into smaller parts that can be checked individually.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt29 t91 t28 t91 t86 t23 t94 t50 t74 t26 t18 t28 t92 t29 t1 t47 t21 t86 t86 t42 t92 t21 t59 t92 t49 t86 t78 t28 t23 t74\n\nI notice that the string is 30 tokens long. Since each step in the grammar can produce two non-terminals (since it's in CNF, each production has two symbols on the right), the total number of symbols in the derived string must be 2^n, where n is the number of productions used. But 30 is not a power of two, so maybe that's a hint. However, the string could be a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, all are terminals except perhaps some non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, let me clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a single terminal. So any derived string can be generated by a sequence of A -> BC expansions, leading to a leftmost derivation that builds the string until all are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string must be a leftmost derivation where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (or a terminal if it's a production like A->a).\n\nSo to check if the string is in the language, I can attempt a backward parse: starting from the entire string and trying to find the top-level non-terminal, which should be S.\n\nBut given the length, this might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for known substrings or patterns.\n\nLooking for known terminals in the grammar that are in the string:\n\nt49, t50, t23, t47, etc., are all terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, all tokens are either t... or letters. Wait, no, all tokens in the string seem to be tokens in the grammar. For example, t29 is a terminal, as NT29 can produce 't29' (from the grammar):\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT8\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\nNT1 -> NT30 NT27\nNT27 -> NT4 NT26\nNT4 -> NT0 NT11\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but later in the grammar, some NT symbols produce terminals like NT23 -> t49, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find which non-terminals produce each of these terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nt29 is produced by NT29 -> 't29' (from the grammar line NT29 -> t29).\n\nSimilarly, t50 is produced by NT15 -> 't50' (grammar line NT15 -> t50).\n\nt26 is produced by NT26 -> t26.\n\nt86 is produced by NT86? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, there's a line: NT86 isn't in the grammar. Wait, looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's parse the grammar again. The grammar ends at NT23, etc., but in the grammar lines, some are written as 'tN' letters. For example:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n...\nNT23 -> 't49' (from line NT23 -> t49?)\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar provided, I see that some NT symbols produce 't's, like:\n\nFrom the grammar lines:\n\nNT23 -> t49\nNT15 -> t50\nNT2 -> t47\nNT21 -> t21\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe grammar has lines like:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT30 -> NT3 NT1\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24\nNT7 -> NT23 NT2\nNT1 -> NT0 NT3\nNT29 -> NT7 NT8\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT19 -> NT23 NT27\nNT18 -> NT10 NT26\nNT30 -> NT22 NT8\nNT10 -> NT14 NT22\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\nNT19 -> NT29 NT29\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\nNT26 -> NT8 NT26\nNT6 -> NT17 NT3\nNT2 -> NT25 NT19\nNT26 -> NT2 NT19\nNT26 -> NT4 NT29\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\nNT19 -> NT6 NT19\nNT8 -> NT18 NT16\nNT20 -> NT26 NT30\nNT3 -> NT12 NT26\nNT20 -> NT18 NT22\nNT10 -> NT9 NT27\nNT15 -> NT23 NT6\nNT23 -> NT27 NT16\nNT14 -> NT21 NT22\nNT24 -> NT9 NT20\nNT21 -> NT28 NT24\nNT17 -> NT19 NT2\nNT17 -> NT16 NT25\nNT28 -> NT20 NT18\nNT23 -> NT1 NT11\nNT9 -> NT5 NT2\nNT21 -> NT5 NT14\nNT0 -> NT6 NT28\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) is defined by tuples (V, \u03a3, R, S), where V is the set of variables, \u03a3 is the set of terminals, R is the set of production rules, and S is the start symbol. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are variables and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it consists of several productions. Some of them have variables on the right-hand side, like S \u2192 NT23 NT5. Each of these productions directly expands a variable into two other variables or terminals. Our goal is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string provided is: `t78 t28 t86 t86 t91 t91 t94 t86 t1 t49 t18 t47 t59 t86 t49 t69 t23 t82 t28 t91 t21 t42 t59 t29 t26 t21 t1 t23 t80 t62 t82`.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals are letters like t78, t28, etc., which are probably terminal symbols in this grammar. \n\nI should start from the start symbol S and try to break down the string into the productions. Since it's in CNF, each production step will replace a variable with two others. So, the parsing process would involve splitting the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT5\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nI'll check which of these can produce the string.\n\nLet's pick the first one: S \u2192 NT23 NT5. This would mean the first part is generated by NT23, followed by NT5. The string starts with t78, which could be the result of NT23 being expanded. Let's see if NT23 can produce t78.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 is defined as NT24 NT6. Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should use a parsing strategy like leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see which terminals in the string correspond to production rules. For example, some of the 't's followed by numbers might be terminals from specific productions.\n\nLooking at the string again, I see 't78', 't28', 't86', etc. Let's see if these are terminals or can be part of any productions.\n\nIn the grammar, some of the terminals include 't49', 't50', 't21', 't22', 't74', etc. But others like 't78' and 't86' are not directly listed. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014the given grammar has some terminals like 't47', 't42', 't59', 't62', etc., but 't78', 't86', etc., aren't listed. That makes me think these might be non-terminals or part of other productions. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the string uses variables that I need to expand further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't's are part of the variables. For example, in the grammar, NT7 is rewritten as NT24 NT6. So, if a variable NT7 expands to t7, but in the string it's t78, which is two digits. Maybe each 't' followed by a number represents a single terminal symbol. But I'm not entirely certain how to interpret these.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that N symbols (non-terminals) and terminal symbols can be matched with the given string. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, right? So, t78 is a terminal, t28 is another, etc.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if the string can be built by applying the productions starting from S.\n\nLet's break down the string: [t78], [t28], [t86], [t86], [t91], [t91], [t94], [t86], [t1], [t49], [t18], [t47], [t59], [t86], [t49], [t69], [t23], [t82], [t28], [t91], [t21], [t42], [t59], [t29], [t26], [t21], [t1], [t23], [t80], [t62], [t82].\n\nThis looks quite long, but let me see if I can find a way to split it into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT5. So the first part would be NT23 and the second NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, if the first part is t78, which might come from NT23, but I need to see how.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT7 is defined as NT24 NT6. So, NT7 could produce t24 followed by t6. But in the grammar, I also see NT24 being NT9 NT20, among others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe instead of trying to derive the entire string from S, I can parse the string using the grammar by applying the inverse approach: starting from the string and trying to reduce it to S.\n\nIn parsing, we look for the leftmost occurrence where a production can be applied. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces a variable with two terminals or variables. So, for a given string, we look for possible splits and see if the parts can be reduced.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t78. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t78 as its first symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 is defined as NT24 NT6. So, if t78 is the first symbol, perhaps the first production is NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6. Then, the next step would be to see if the rest of the string starts with t24 followed by t6. Hmm, but the string starts with t78, t28, etc. Maybe that's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see which non-terminal can produce t78. Let's check the productions of non-terminals. NT23 has a production as NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT11. That doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, maybe looking at the entire grammar might help.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals do have production rules that end with a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8. So, NT5 produces two non-terminals. But NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which are non-terminals again. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals are actually single symbols, but in this case, the terminals are sequences like 't78', 't28', etc. So, each is a single terminal. So, in the grammar, when a non-terminal is expanded, it can do so into two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the given string, 't78' is the first symbol. So, I need a production where a non-terminal expands to t78 as the first symbol. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals have t78 as part of their expansion?\n\nLooking, for example, NT19 has a production NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29. No terminals there. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 NT19 NT12. No terminal. Wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me go through each non-terminal's rule.\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2.

Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, in the later lines, I see entries like NT24 -> 't1', where 't' is part of a single symbol. But in the initial productions, variables like NT24, NT25, etc., only expand into variables, not terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe after a certain point, the variables start producing terminals. For example, NT23 has NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which are variables. Then somewhere, one of these variables might produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through, I see that NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8. Still non-terminals. Then, NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24.

{"custom_id":"request-488","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which represents a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of production rules that generate strings of terminals and non-terminals. The CFG provided is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals (A is a non-terminal, B and C can be either non-terminals or terminals). However, in this case, looking at some of the productions, I see that some non-terminals are producing other non-terminals directly, which might mean that the grammar is not strictly in CNF as per the usual definition where all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Wait, actually, in CNF, the right-hand side can be two symbols, terminals or non-terminals. So the given grammar seems to be in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t49 t18 t80 t69 t1 t21 t82 t80 t59 t23 t78 t59 t94 t23 t97 t78 t42 t47 t91 t94 t97 t86 t62 t97 t78 t47 t78 t23 t78 t86 t94.\n\nEach token is a terminal symbol, which could be a variable or a constant. Now, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll check how the grammar starts. The start symbol is S. From the productions, S can produce combinations like NT23 NT24 NT5, but looking closer, the grammar shows multiple S productions: S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nWait, looking again, the productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo the string starts with t49, t18, etc., but looking for the start symbol S. The string seems long, but perhaps it's generated by a series of these productions.\n\nI notice that the first token is t49, which corresponds to NT23 \u2192 t49 as per the rule NT23 \u2192 t49. That suggests that NT23 is the left-hand side of a production that produces t49. From the production rules, yes, there is NT23 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo, the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, because S can produce that. Then, the NT23 can be t49, so that gives t49. Then, the NT24 would need to be something that can produce the rest of the string starting from t18 t80... etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step, checking if the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me outline the string tokens again: t49, t18, t80, t69, t1, t21, t82, t80, t59, t23, t78, t59, t94, t23, t97, t78, t42, t47, t91, t94, t97, t86, t62, t97, t78, t47, t78, t23, t78, t86, t94.\n\nThe string is 32 tokens long. Starting with t49, which comes from NT23 \u2192 t49. So the first production would be S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Then, the rest of the string needs to be derived from NT24 followed by NT23.\n\nNow, looking at NT24, according to the rules, NT24 \u2192 t1, t28, t1, etc. Wait, checking the productions for NT24: \n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t1, so if we can get t1 next, that works. Let me check the string after t49: the next tokens are t18, t80, etc. So the initial tokens after t49 are t18, which doesn't match t1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. After NT23 (which is t49), the next production would be NT24, which can be t1 or t28. But the string after t49 is t18, which is the second token. So maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps there's a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string by finding matching productions. Another approach is to check each token against the possible productions, ensuring that the left-hand side can generate the right-hand side in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting with S and trying to match the string.\n\nStarting with S, the first production to use is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, as that gives us t49 (from NT23 \u2192 t49) and then NT24 can generate t1 or t28. But the next token after t49 is t18, which is not t1 or t28. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT16. Let's see: NT20 \u2192 t97, t80. Looking at the first token, it's t49, not t97 or t80. So that might not fit.\n\nAnother production is S \u2192 NT17 NT3, which could end up as something else, not t49. S \u2192 NT20 NT6: NT20 can produce t97, t80, etc. Not matching t49.\n\nWait, only S \u2192 NT23 NT24 can start with t49, right? Because NT23 \u2192 t49, so the first token must come from NT23 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo first token is t49, then after that, the remaining string is t18 t80 t69 t1 t21 t82 t80 t59 t23 t78 t59 t94 t23 t97 t78 t42 t47 t91 t94 t97 t86 t62 t97 t78 t47 t78 t23 t78 t86 t94.\n\nSo the initial production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which gives t49 followed by NT24.\n\nNow, what does NT24 produce? Looking at the production rules for NT24: NT24 \u2192 t1, NT24 \u2192 t28, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT8, etc. There's NT24 \u2192 t1, which would produce t1, but the next token after t49 is t18, not t1. Alternatively, perhaps NT24 can produce something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a longer production that can be used. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT8. Let me see if that works. So after NT23 \u2192 t49, the next part is NT24, which could be NT5 NT8, and then that would need to derive the rest of the string starting with t18.\n\nSo the string after t49 is t18 t80... which would need to be produced by NT5 followed by NT8. So let's see: NT5 can produce various things, such as NT15, NT57? Wait, looking at the production rules:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT5\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nWait, actually, looking back, the production rules for NT5 are:\n\nWait, in the given rules, starting from NT5:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT5 \u2192 NT26 NT9\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nActually, looking at the production rules for NT5, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT5 \u2192 NT26 NT17\nWait, no, looking again, the production rules for NT5 in the given are:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at lines:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\nNT5 -> NT26 NT17\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a bunch of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I remember that the Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the grammar seems to have multiple production rules directly for S, NT23, and others. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't28', then 't1', 't18', etc. I realize that some of the production rules directly result in terminals, like 't28', 't47', etc. These are probably the leaves in the derivation tree. \n\nI think the approach should be to try to decompose the string step by step, checking if each part can be generated by the grammar. Starting with the entire string, I split it into possible two parts, each matching a production rule. \n\nLet me try to see if the whole string can be broken down. The string length is 30 tokens. If I consider the first two parts, perhaps looking for a rule that can split the string into two compatible parts. \n\nLooking back at the grammar, for example, the production S -> NT20 NT16. The S generates two non-terminals. So perhaps the entire string can be split into two parts that each can be generated by NT20 and NT16. \n\nWait, but NT20 might further split into other non-terminals, each of which can generate more tokens. Alternatively, maybe I can use a recursive approach, checking if the first token matches any terminal in the grammar and then seeing if the rest of the string can be generated by the remaining part. \n\nHmm, but the grammar isn't in a standard form for easy parsing because it's quite big. It might be easier to use the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure how to apply it here. Alternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach would work, starting from S and seeing if the string can be produced.\n\nAnother approach is to list all the terminals in the grammar. The terminals are tokens like 't28', 't1', 't18', up to 't97', 't86', etc. Each non-terminal can expand into two terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nSo, for the string, I need to see if it can be produced by the grammar starting from S. I can try breaking the string into parts that match the production rules. For example, starting with 't28', I can see if there's a production that directly matches 't28'. Looking through the productions, I see that some of the productions result in 't' followed by numbers, like NT23 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't50', etc. \n\nWait, there's a production NT23 -> 't49', and elsewhere NT23 -> NT5 NT20, etc. So 't28' is generated by perhaps NT28 -> 't28', but I need to check if NT28 has a production that starts with 't28'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT28 has a production: NT28 -> NT5 NT9, which is a non-terminal expansion. But there's also NT28 -> 't80' in another rule. Wait, let me check: yes, NT28 has multiple productions, one of which is 't80', and others like NT28 -> NT23 NT9, etc. So 't80' is directly a terminal, so in the string, when we have 't80', it must come from that production.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the string has sequences like 't28 t1 t18 t92 t1 t28 t18 t62 t18 t1 t18 t80 t42 t47 t50 t1 t97 t86 t28 t59 t23 t94 t26 t50 t18 t69 t28 t50 t62 t49 t59 t78'. That is 30 tokens.\n\nI'll try to split the string into chunks that can be generated by non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider splitting the string into two parts from the first non-terminal. Let's look for possible splits that can be generated by leftmost derivation.\n\nFor example, starting with S, which can produce NT20 NT16. Then, each of those can be non-terminals or terminals. So the string could start with a production that starts with NT20. Looking at the grammar, NT20 expands to many things, including NT17 NT8, which is a non-terminal expansion. Wait, perhaps we can find a path where the first token 't28' comes from NT28 directly, but then we need to see how that combines with other parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the overall approach is to see if the string can be built by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string by looking for possible matches from the grammar's terminals. Let me list the terminals from the grammar: 't28', 't1', 't18', 't92', 't26', 't78', 't62', 't59', 't97', 't86', 't42', 't47', 't50', 't18', 't69', 't23', 't94', 't26', 't50', 't18', 't69', 't28', 't50', 't62', 't49', 't59', 't78'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the production for NT26 is NT26 -> NT12 NT7. So it can generate two non-terminals, each of which can expand further.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to try memoization or a recursive descent parser, but I don't have that luxury here. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that the grammar has only a few non-terminals that can produce certain terminals, and trying to follow the string's structure.\n\nFor example, let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't28'. Looking in the grammar, I see that NT28 is defined as production:\n\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT11\n- Others involve NT28 as a left-hand side in more complex productions.\n\nSo, the first 't28' could come from NT28 -> 't80'. Then, the next token is 't1'. So after 't80', the next is 't1'. So, we need to see if 't1' can be produced by the next non-terminal.\n\nBut after 't80', assuming we used NT28 -> 't80', there's no Nterminal after that, but 't80' is a terminal. Hmm, no, wait: NT28 is a non-terminal that can produce these terminals or other non-terminals. So if the first token is 't28' from NT28 -> 't80', then the remaining string after 't80' would be 't1 t18 t92 t1 t28 t18 t62 t18 t1 t18 t80 t42 t47 t50 t1 t97 t86 t28 t59 t23 t94 t26 t50 t18 t69 t28 t50 t62 t49 t59 t78'.\n\nWait, but after 't80' (the first token), the next part starts with 't1', which might be an issue because NT28 only directly produces 't80' as a terminal, not 't1'. So perhaps the first 't28' comes from some other production of NT28. Let's check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT28's productions:\n\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT11\n- Others involve NT28 as a non-terminal on the left, meaning NT28 can't directly produce 't1' because it's a non-terminal. So the 't1' must come from another non-terminal expansion beyond NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. The string's first token is 't28', which must come from a production that generates 't28' as a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce 't' followed by a number, like NT28 -> 't80', NT23 -> 't49', NT23 -> 't50', etc.\n\nSo 't28' could be from NT28 -> 't28'? Wait, no, looking back, the production rules for NT28 are:\n\nFrom the provided context, NT28 is defined as:\n\n- NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-494","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to figure out whether each token is reachable from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I see that most of them are non-terminals breaking down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe provided string is: `t74 t29 t92 t92 t62 t29 t1 t42 t59 t91 t82 t82 t47 t59 t42 t94 t80 t29 t18 t29 t62 t78 t82 t23 t29 t80 t1 t69 t59 t1 t91 t50`\n\nI notice that several tokens correspond to non-terminals, and some are terminals. For example, 't74', 't29', etc., are likely terminals, while others represent non-terminals based on the grammar.\n\nMy task is to trace back from each token in the string to see if they can be derived from some non-terminal and eventually back to S. If all tokens can be produced by the grammar, then the answer is \"Yes\"; otherwise, it's \"No\".\n\nI'll start by listing the terminal symbols in the string to see which ones are present: 74, 29, 92, 62, 1, 42, 59, 91, 82, 47, 80, 18, 78, 23, 50. These seem to represent terminal values.\n\nNext, I'll check if each of these terminals can be derived from some non-terminal. For example, 't74' must come from a production where a non-terminal can go directly to 't74'. Looking at the grammar, I see a production NT15 \u2192 't50' and NT2 \u2192 't94'. Wait, I also see NT7 \u2192 't82', which is a terminal.\n\nI'll go through each token in the string and see if they can be reached.\n\n1. t74: Looking for a production that directly outputs t74. I see NT23 \u2192 't82', which is t82, not t74. Hmm, maybe through another path. Let me check if there's a production for NT23 or any other non-terminals that can derive to 74. Looking through the productions, I don't find a direct production to 74. Maybe it's derived from a longer chain.\n\n2. t29: Check if t29 can be produced. From the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't82' and other productions. Wait, there's a production NT20 \u2192 't97', which doesn't help. Maybe t29 comes from a non-terminal that can produce it. Let me check the grammar for any productions that lead to 29.\n\n3. t92: Similarly, check if t92 is a terminal that comes from a non-terminal. Looking at NT12 \u2192 't29', which would produce 29, but I'm looking for 92. Maybe NT12 \u2192 't29' doesn't help, but perhaps somewhere else.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree or at least seeing if each token in the string can be connected through the grammar rules.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if each token is present in the start symbol's derivations. Since the start symbol is S, if all tokens can be derived through some productions, then it's yes. If any token is not present, it's no.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that S \u2192 NT23 NT24, each of which goes to specific non-terminals. But since all the tokens in the string seem to be terminals (like t74, t29, etc.), I need to check if each is a terminal that can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps some tokens are non-terminals. For example, 't74' is a terminal, but I need to see if it's represented by a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, the only terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, which are likely just placeholders, but perhaps each represents a specific production.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Maybe the string is a sequence of tokens where each token represents a non-terminal in the grammar. Let me check: for example, 't74' might correspond to NT15 \u2192 't50', but that's not matching. Alternatively, 't74' might be a terminal that's produced by some non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, each 't' followed by a number might represent a specific non-terminal. For example, 't74' could be the production of NT23, which has several productions, some leading to terminals and some to other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6. Hmm, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should look for each token in the string and see if it's a terminal or non-terminal and check its possible derivations.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to check if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar. Given that the grammar has multiple productions and terminals, it's possible the string is a valid output.\n\nWait, another thought: if the string is a valid derivation, each part of it must be connectable through the productions. To confirm, perhaps I should simulate a derivation from S.\n\nBut given the time and complexity, perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" because the string seems to be constructed in a way that follows the grammar's rules, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some tokens might not have a corresponding production.\n\nWait, after carefully reviewing the grammar and the string, I realize that some tokens like t74, t29, t92, etc., might not have any production in the grammar that leads to them. For example, t74 isn't a terminal in the grammar, and I don't see a production that outputs it directly or indirectly. Therefore, it's likely that the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string isn't generated by the given grammar. Therefore, the answer is \"No\".\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-505","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems there are several production rules starting from S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t23 t47 t23 t42 t21 t92 t69 t78 t74 t92 t21 t26 t82 t86 t94 t91 t47 t49 t42 t80 t74 t80 t97 t82 t21 t78 t1 t28 t42 t18 t23 t69 t23`.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the parsing process is straightforward using a method called the CYK algorithm, which determines whether a string can be derived from the grammar. However, since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't23' and ends with 't23'. Looking at the grammar rules, 't' symbols seem to be terminals that are defined by specific production rules. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT23, NT30, etc. \n\nLet me list out some key rules that involve 't' terminals:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49' (I think this is incorrect because in the given grammar, NT23 has multiple rules, but the last line above mentions NT23 -> 't49', which might be a typo because other rules suggest longer productions. Wait, looking back, actually, in the grammar provided, there's a rule like NT23 -> NT9 NT4, etc., and also some NTs go directly to 't's. For example, NT26 -> 't23' in one rule, NT21 -> 't21', and so on. So these 't's are terminals defined directly by these production rules. \n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that at the end of the grammar, there are a bunch of rules where NTs are replaced by 't' symbols and numbers. For example:\n\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT17 -> 't50'\n- NT2-> 't47' and so on.\n\nSo these are specific terminal productions, meaning that in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce a terminal and another symbol, or perhaps just a terminal.\n\nNow, looking at the string: it starts with 't23 t47 t23'. I need to see if the grammar has a way to produce these in sequence.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions, the first few rules are:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\n\nBut then in the grammar, I also see rules that produce 't's. For example:\n\nLooking back, the grammar includes rules like NT23 -> 't49' in some cases, but wait, actually, the last part in the user's message seems to have a lot of rules with 't' terminals, but I have to parse that correctly.\n\nWait, I think I need to read the grammar again more carefully. The user provided the grammar as a series of lines, each line being a production. Let's process that.\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar, here's a list of production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\nWait, no, wait. The user's grammar is written as a series of lines, each line is a production, e.g.,\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\n...\n\nSimilarly, NT23's productions are lines starting with 'NT23 ->' so, for example:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\nBut looking further down, some NTs have rules that produce 't's:\n\nLooking at the end of the user's grammar:\n\nNT25 -> NT30 NT11\n\n...\n\nWait, but then I see lines like:\n\nNT23 -> 't49'\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT21 -> 't21'\n\nWait, no, looking at the end:\n\n- NT30 -> 't29' etc.\n\nWait, I'm confused because the grammar presented as input seems to have some rules where non-terminals are replaced by strings of terminals and non-terminals, but also some rules where a non-terminal is replaced directly by a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the user's grammar includes multiple lines, but each line is a production. For example, the last part of the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT21 -> 't21'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT22 -> 't28'\n\nNT23 -> 't49'\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again:\n\nThe user's grammar ends with:\n\n...\n\nNT26 -> NT12\n\nNT27 -> NT4 NT26\n\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT15 -> NT23 NT6\n\n...\n\nAnd finally, a series of lines where NTs are replaced by 't's:\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT21 -> 't21'\n\nNT23 -> 't49'\n\nBut wait, I'm getting mixed up with the lines. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nI think the key point is that certain non-terminals like NT23 have rules that produce 't's. For example, one of the rules for NT23 is NT23 -> 't49'. Similarly, NT26 -> 't23', NT21 -> 't21', etc.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first part is 't23 t47 t23'. So the first 't23' must come from a production that includes 't23'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT23, one of the rules is NT23 -> 't49', but that's not 't23'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look again at the grammar lines. Oh, I see that in the later rules, NT23 has a rule NT23 -> 't49', but that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, let me check: the last few lines of the user's grammar are:\n\nNT26 -> 't23'\n\nNT21 -> 't21'\n\nNT23 -> 't49'\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because earlier NT23 had other rules. But perhaps in the full grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, and others produce further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is such that the NT23 can either produce a combination of non-terminals or a 't' followed by a number.\n\nBut wait, if the production of NT23 includes a terminal 't', then in the string, a 't23' would correspond to that production.\n\nBut in the given string, 't23' appears twice at the beginning and then again towards the end. So perhaps there's a production for NT23 that directly gives 't23'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's see the structure more carefully.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules again, focusing on the more important ones:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT9\n\n- NT23 -> 't49' (is this correct?)\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar, in the lines towards the end, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n\n- NT23 -> 't42'\n\nWait, perhaps not.

Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because in CNF, the structure of the parse tree is straightforward: each production corresponds directly to a level in the tree. \n\nLooking at the string we need to evaluate: `t28 t29 t80 t80 t97 t1 t1 t23 t86 t91 t29 t86 t21 t97 t91 t23 t18 t49 t86 t94 t69 t80 t94 t42 t29 t94 t23 t62 t62 t69 t49 t21 t1`.\n\nI see a lot of these 't' like t28, t29, etc. I should check what each of these represents. From the grammar rules, it looks like some non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For instance, NT23 -> 't49' among others. So, each 't' is a terminal, and the grammar defines how non-terminals can expand into combinations of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or perhaps apply the Cocke-Younger-Kasdan (CYK) algorithm, but given the size of the string, manual analysis might be more feasible.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long, and manually tracing might be time-consuming.

Also, in CNF, start symbols are non-terminals, and all other non-terminals derive terminal strings, which are actually a single symbol in this case, as per the entries in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, each rule starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT23, etc.) and produces either another non-terminal or a single terminal symbol, except for the start symbol S which has several productions leading to sequences of NT's.\n\nWait, but in CNF, all productions except for the start symbol should have terminals only on the right. However, in the grammar, some non-terminals do produce single terminals, like NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT8, but wait, NT15 seems to produce terminals? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: In CNF, a grammar is in CNF if all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (terminal). The start symbol can have productions leading to both non-terminals and terminals? Or is the start symbol the only symbol that can produce a terminal?\n\nActually, in CNF, the start symbol can produce either a sequence of non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals, while other non-terminals produce only non-terminals until they reach the terminals. Or sometimes, the grammar is defined so that all non-terminals produce terminals, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, every production is of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. So each production either produces a terminal symbol directly or a sequence of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the production NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11, that's two non-terminals. But looking at the string, each token is a terminal, like t28, t86, etc. So each token corresponds to a production of a non-terminal to a terminal. So perhaps the non-terminals can only produce terminals as single symbols. But in the grammar, most right-hand sides are two non-terminals, but sometimes a single terminal is present. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6. Are there any productions that only have a single terminal on the RHS? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, most of the rules have two non-terminals. For example, NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29, which is two non-terminals. The start symbol S has productions to combinations of NT's, none of which produce terminals directly except at the end, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. In the given grammar, all the productions except the start symbol (S) have the form NT -> NT NT, but perhaps S can have productions that directly lead to terminals? Wait, looking again: the productions are all S \u2192 NT23 NT24, etc. Then the NTs are all productions with two NTs. So perhaps the entire grammar is made up of only NT symbols, and the start symbol is the only one that can have a string of NTs that will eventually translate to terminals.\n\nBut in reality, each NT production represents a step to build up the string, and when all the NTs are reduced to terminals, the string is built. However, in this case, the string provided consists solely of terminals (like t28, t91, etc.), so each token corresponds to a production of NT to a terminal.\n\nWait, but the grammar in CNF would have each non-terminal derive a sequence of terminals, but actually, the productions are in CNF so each step is a pair of non-terminals. Then the overall process is that each NT production is replaced by two NT productions, which in turn may produce terminals or non-terminals until the full string is built.\n\nBut how does the string get built? Each step in the derivation reduces the number of NTs by replacing one with two, and eventually, all NTs are reduced to terminals.\n\nBut given the string, it's a sequence of terminals, which must have been produced by a series of productions starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string against the grammar. The CYK algorithm works for CNF grammars and can determine if a string is in the language by checking each position and each symbol against the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can break it down into parts based on the productions.\n\nWait, but since the user provided the full string, and it's a single string, perhaps the CYK algorithm is the way to go.\n\nGiven that, let me outline the steps I would take:\n\n1. Number the positions of the string from 0 to n-1, where n is the length.\n\n2. Initialize a matrix where cell (i, j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at i and ending at j.\n\n3. For intervals of length 1 (i.e., each single character), check which NTs produce that character.\n\n4. For longer intervals, split them into two parts, considering the left and right parts, and check if there's a production that connects them with a NT.\n\nWait, but the string given is \"t28 t86 t91 t23 t80 t18 t26 t69 t26 t74 t49 t29 t69 t69 t18 t1 t78 t74 t59 t59 t26 t29 t23 t94 t69 t1 t82 t74 t80 t82 t91 t94 t62 t59\". Each token is a single symbol, but the non-terminals sometimes expand into multiple symbols. So each token in the string must correspond to the application of a production rule that leads directly to a terminal.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, which in turn expand further until a terminal is reached. So the single symbols in the string must be derived through a path of productions.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to map the string to the productions. Each token is a terminal, so each must be matched by an NT production that reduces to that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the NTs produce terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1, etc. But from the list, I see some NTs producing terminals. For instance, NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9, but looking at the productions, I don't see any NTs directly producing a single terminal except perhaps some at the end.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, most productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT, meaning they produce two non-terminals. Only some have single terminals? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\nWait, so NT5 is NT15 and NT8. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT1. But none of these produce a single terminal. So perhaps in this grammar, there are no productions that directly produce a single terminal. Then all productions must go through multiple steps.\n\nBut that can't be, because then the string we need to test can't be a concatenation of these steps since the string consists solely of terminals, each of which must have been produced through some path.\n\nWait, but if all productions are two non-terminals, then it's impossible for a single terminal to appear in the string, except when the NTs at some point have a production that produces a terminal all the way.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. If every production in the grammar produces two non-terminals (e.g., all rules are NT \u2192 NT NT), then the entire string would have to be built by a series of replacements, but the end result would only produce sequences of non-terminals until they hit a production that produces a terminal. But in this grammar, looking at the rules, every production seems to be of two non-terminals, except that I can't find any production that ends in a terminal.\n\nWait, looking more closely through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28\nNT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\nNT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n...\nWait, perhaps none of the given productions produce a single terminal symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-511","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are the symbols in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll read the grammar carefully to understand how the symbols can combine. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production is a single non-terminal symbol transforming into two non-terminals or a terminal. This helps because it simplifies the analysis; I don't have to deal with \u03b5-productions or other complexities.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't47', and so on. These terminals are part of the string I need to evaluate.\n\nNow, I'll list out the starting symbol, S. From the grammar, S can produce combinations like NT23 NT24 or others. I'll have to see if the string can be built starting from S, using the productions.\n\nThe string starts with 't59'. Let's check which NT productions lead to t59. Looking through the grammar, I see NT16 -> 't59'. So, to get 't59', we can have NT16 as one part. But looking at the context of NT16, in the grammar, NT16 only appears in S -> NT20 NT16. So, the first production of S is NT20 NT16, which would give us t59 as the second symbol.\n\nWait, the string starts with t59, so perhaps the first symbol is from NT20, and the second is from NT16. Let me see: S -> NT20 NT16, which would produce t59 (from NT16) and then another symbol from NT20. But the first token is t59, which matches NT16, so maybe the first part is NT16. Then, what's NT20? Looking at the grammar, NT20 can be various things. Let's see: NT20 -> NT9 NT8, NT20 -> NT6 NT3, etc. Wait, in the grammar, S can be NT20 NT16, which would mean that NT20 would produce t59 (from NT16) but actually, NT16 is terminal. So maybe my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t59 comes from NT16, as NT16 produces 't59'. So looking at the grammar, S can only be in the form of two NT productions. But in the string, the first symbol is t59, so the S must resolve to something that starts with t59. Looking at S's productions, S can be NT20 NT16, which would be two symbols, each produced by their respective NT. So, in that case, the first symbol would come from NT20 and the second from NT16.\n\nBut wait, NT16 only appears as a terminal in the grammar, or does it produce a terminal? Wait, in the grammar, I see NT16 -> 't59', so NT16 is a terminal symbol. So in the string, if the first symbol is 't59', which is produced by NT16, that means the entire string must be derived starting from S -> NT20 NT16. So the string's first two elements would be the results of NT20 and NT16, respectively.\n\nBut wait, 't59' is the first symbol. So perhaps the first part is NT20 producing another symbol, and the second part is NT16 producing 't59'. So the first two elements of the string should be from NT20 and NT16. Let me check if the first element after 't59' is another symbol. The string is: t59 t91 t91 t80 t50 t94 t50 t97 t21 t74 t50 t97 t69 t18 t49 t80 t94 t21 t74 t26 t26 t29 t82 t28 t18 t59 t91 t91 t62 t23 t78 t47.\n\nWait, the first element is t59, which is 't59' \u2013 that's NT16. So the next element is t91, which is NT15. Looking at the grammar, S is NT20 NT16, which would split into two parts: NT20 and NT16. So the second element would be from NT20. Looking at the grammar, NT20 can produce things like NT9 NT8, NT6 NT3, etc. Let's see if 't91' is among the terminals from NT20. Looking through NT20 productions, I don't see any terminal symbols except possibly if any of the non-terminals produce t91. Wait, t91 is a terminal in NT15. So NT15 is 't91'. So perhaps the second element comes from NT20, which needs to be split into symbols that include t91 as part of NT20's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's try to approach this systematically.\n\nThe string starts with t59, which is NT16. So the entire string must be the result of S -> NT20 NT16. Therefore, the string is t59 followed by the expansion of NT20. Let's look at what T91 is: The second token is t91, which is NT15. So the second symbol in the string should come from NT20. Let's check what NT20 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT20 can be:\n\n- NT9 NT8\n- NT6 NT3\n- NT14 NT22\n- NT24 NT5\n- NT26 NT30\n- NT5 NT20\n- NT29 NT2\n- NT7 NT8\n- etc.\n\nNone of these produce a terminal directly, except possibly if any of the components do. For example, NT20 -> NT9 NT8, so the first part would produce whatever NT9 and NT8 produce. Let's see:\n\n- NT9: looking for where NT9 produces 't91'. But from the grammar, I don't see NT9 -> t91. Instead, NT9 is part of NT24 -> t1, etc. So I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let's think differently: the string needs to be a valid derivation sequence starting from S. Let's try to parse the string backward or look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to build the derivation step by step. Starting from S, which can only be NT20 NT16, so the first symbol is t59 (from NT16). Then, the second symbol would come from NT20's expansion. Wait, no, actually, S is NT20 followed by NT16, which would produce a sequence where the first symbol is from NT20 and the second from NT16. So if the string starts with t59, that's from NT16, but the first part of S is NT20, which shouldn't produce t59. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. The productions are such that the left side produces the right side as a concatenation. So S -> NT20 NT16 means that S produces a string where the first part is NT20 and the second part is NT16. So in terms of the string, S would give us something like A B, where A is the string generated by NT20 and B is the string generated by NT16. Therefore, the first symbol in the string should be from NT20 and the second from NT16. But the string starts with t59, which is from NT16, which suggests that the second element must be from NT20. That can't be because S is NT20 NT16, so the first symbol is NT20 and second is NT16. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT20.\n\nBut the first symbol is t59, which is NT16. That can't happen because the first symbol comes from NT20. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to start with t59, because that would imply that NT20 produces t59, but looking at the grammar, NT20 doesn't have a production that produces a terminal. All the productions of NT20 are to other non-terminals. So that would mean that the string cannot start with NT16 as the first symbol because S's first symbol must come from NT20.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be produced by the grammar because the first element is t59, which comes from NT16, but S resolves to NT20 followed by NT16, making the first symbol part of NT20, which does not produce a terminal like t59. Instead, NT20 resolves to other non-terminals which might eventually produce a terminal, but not at the first step unless one of the NTs produces a terminal directly.\n\nWait, looking back"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammar has productions where the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols, or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, it does seem to be in CNF since all RHSs are either two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't62', which I guess represents a terminal symbol. To see if this string fits the grammar, I need to track how these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. \n\nStarting from the initial symbol 'S', I check its productions. Each rule for S leads to two non-terminals. For example, S -> NT23 NT24, etc. So the first step would be to see if 't62' could be derived from any of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals have productions ending with 't26' or other terminals. For instance, NT25 -> NT30 NT11, but also some terminals like NT5 -> 't26', NT1 -> 't6', etc. So, each time a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol, it's a step closer to building the string.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step. The string starts with 't62', which I look for in the grammar. From NT2, which has a rule NT2 -> 't94', that's not it. NT4 has NT4 -> 't26', which is another number. Wait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce 't' symbols. For example, NT5 -> 't26', NT22 -> 't28', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a parse tree. Starting with S, the first production is S -> NT23 NT24. So the string must start with the terminals generated by NT23 and NT24.\n\nLooking at NT23, its production includes NT16 and NT20. Wait, maybe I should look for each terminal in the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. Since the string is long, perhaps it's easier to track each step, but that might take too long. Alternatively, I can use the fact that each production is two non-terminals, and the terminals are at the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built from the root S, which has two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals has further productions. So the string length should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. The given string has 32 characters, which is 2^5, so that makes sense\u2014it would require 5 levels of productions.\n\nLet me try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar. For example, 't62' would need to come from a rule that ends with 't62'. Looking through the rules, I see NT2 -> 't94', which is close. Wait, maybe NT26 -> 't23' or other terminals. Alternatively, maybe NT28 -> something but I don't see a 't62' directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a rule.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see NT2 -> 't94' and NT26 -> 't23', but not 't62'. Maybe 't62' is derived indirectly. Let's trace back. Suppose the first symbol is 't62', which must come from a non-terminal that can derive to 't62'. Looking at the rules, do any non-terminals produce 't62'? \n\nLooking through the RHS, I see NT2 -> 't94', so that's not it. NT5 -> 't26', NT21 -> 't21' which is not a terminal, NT8 -> 't91', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing a direct production, but maybe through a chain. For example, perhaps a non-terminal like NT26 can derive one terminal, and NT23 can derive another.\n\nWait, the string is 't62 t42 t62 t78 t18 t42 t78 t47 t80 t91 t18 t18 t42 t26 t23 t82 t50 t1 t26 t69 t26 t1 t94 t82 t94 t69 t42 t82 t42 t23 t50 t28 t97 t23 t74'.\n\nI notice that 't62' appears at the beginning and some other positions. Perhaps the grammar allows generating multiple 't62's through certain non-terminals. \n\nLet me check if NT26 can produce 't62'. Looking at the grammar, NT26 has multiple rules. One of them is NT26 -> NT4 NT19, which itself are non-terminals. Another is NT26 -> NT22 NT7, which also are non-terminals. Hmm, maybe not directly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't62' is derived from NT2's production, which is 't94', but that's not matching. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Instead, I could use the fact that each production in CNF is a binary expansion, so the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n. The string length is 32, which is 2^5, so the parse tree would have 5 levels. \n\nLet me try to see if each step in the parse tree can produce the corresponding symbol. Starting with S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which splits into two, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is correctly generated. Given the rules, each non-terminal can produce certain terminals, and it's possible to chain them through the productions. Since the string length is a power of two and the grammar is in CNF, it's plausible.\n\nHowever, without seeing each step, it's a bit unclear.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, working through this will take some time, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. All the production rules in CNF have two non-terminals on the right side, except the starting symbol S, which goes to NT, but I think that's covered because the string only has terminals, right? Let me double-check the grammar. Yeah, all the productions start with S and go to NT followed by NT in each rule. So, I'm guessing that the string provided is in terms of the terminals derived from the non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t28 t42 t26 t82 t49 t26 t23 t23 t62 t21 t42 t80 t29 t59 t49 t42 t42 t69 t49 t92 t1 t74 t82 t26 t47 t28 t23 t47 t28 t78 t23 t92 t18 t18`\n\nThat's a mouthful. Let me parse it into individual tokens. There are 44 tokens. Each token seems to be a terminal string, possibly representing a non-terminal in the grammar. For instance, t23 might be NT23, t49 might be NT49, etc.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the grammar, all non-terminals from the start go up to certain numbers like NT30, NT12, and so on. There are some rules where non-terminals produce terminals as well, like NT24 -> 't1' and so on. So, certain NT symbols produce terminal strings starting with 't'. So, the number after 't' might be the NT symbol.\n\nFor example, 't23' would be NT23, right? Similarly, 't28' is NT28, etc.\n\nLet me try to write down the string with replaced non-terminals:\n\nt23 -> NT23\nt28 -> NT28\nt42 -> NT42\nt26 -> NT26\nt82 -> NT82\nt49 -> NT49\nt26 -> NT26\nt23 -> NT23\nt23 -> NT23\nt62 -> NT62\nt21 -> NT21\nt42 -> NT42\nt80 -> NT80\nt29 -> NT29\nt59 -> NT59\nt49 -> NT49\nt42 -> NT42\nt42 -> NT42\nt69 -> NT69\nt49 -> NT49\nt92 -> NT92\nt1 -> NT1\nt74 -> NT74\nt82 -> NT82\nt26 -> NT26\nt47 -> NT47\nt28 -> NT28\nt23 -> NT23\nt47 -> NT47\nt28 -> NT28\nt78 -> NT78\nt23 -> NT23\nt92 -> NT92\nt18 -> NT18\nt18 -> NT18\n\nSo the string as NT symbols is: NT23, NT28, NT42, NT26, NT82, NT49, NT26, NT23, NT23, NT62, NT21, NT42, NT80, NT29, NT59, NT49, NT42, NT42, NT69, NT49, NT92, NT1, NT74, NT82, NT26, NT47, NT28, NT23, NT47, NT28, NT78, NT23, NT92, NT18, NT18.\n\nNow, the starting symbol is S, which according to the grammar, goes to NT24 NT24 or NT20 NT16, etc. So S is a non-terminal that produces combinations of other NT non-terminals.\n\nEach of these production rules is in CNF, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So, for example, S -> NT24 NT24, or S -> NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nGiven that S is the start symbol, any derivation must eventually reduce to a series of NT production rules until we get to the terminals.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because in the given string, all the NT symbols are being presented, not just terminals. Wait, the string given consists of terminals and non-terminals. Or maybe all tokens are non-terminals because the grammar produces sequences of NT symbols, and those NT symbols produce either other NT symbols or terminals.\n\nWait, no. In the string, it's given as a sequence of tokens, some of which are terminals (like t23, t28 etc., which we've translated to NT symbols) and others, like 't' followed by numbers. Wait, perhaps the string is all terminals, but in our case, some of them correspond to NT symbols.\n\nWait, no, the string is just a flat list of tokens, some being terminals (like t23, t28 etc.), which are just terminals labeled with numbers and 't's, and others being sequences like 't49' which might be terminals as well. Or maybe they represent non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the only terminals are those that start with 't', like t1, t23, etc. So the string is entirely composed of these 't' terminals, with the number following 't' indicating their identity.\n\nSo, the input string is: [t23, t28, t42, t26, t82, t49, t26, t23, t23, t62, t21, t42, t80, t29, t59, t49, t42, t42, t69, t49, t92, t1, t74, t82, t26, t47, t28, t23, t47, t28, t78, t23, t92, t18, t18]\n\nWhich means, in terms of non-terminals, this is: NT23, NT28, NT42, NT26, NT82, NT49, NT26, NT23, NT23, NT62, NT21, NT42, NT80, NT29, NT59, NT49, NT42, NT42, NT69, NT49, NT92, NT1, NT74, NT82, NT26, NT47, NT28, NT23, NT47, NT28, NT78, NT23, NT92, NT18, NT18.\n\nSo now, our task is to check whether this sequence of NT symbols can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nBut this approach might be too time-consuming because there are many possible derivations. Perhaps a better way is to construct a parse tree or use dynamic programming for parsing, but given the length of the string (44 symbols), it's a bit cumbersome manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns or inconsistencies that would make the string invalid.\n\nAnother thought is to consider that S can only go to certain combinations of NT24, NT20, etc., so any string that starts with certain NT symbols must have a corresponding production.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, NT23. Let's see what rules produce NT23. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT23 -> NT20 NT4\nNT23 -> NT25 (wait, not sure if that's a rule)\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25 (line 14)\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT9 (line 20)\n- NT23 -> NT20 NT4 (line 28)\nWait, yeah, line 28 is NT23 -> NT20 NT4.\n\nWait, the list includes:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nLine 28: NT23 -> NT20 NT4\nLine 19: NT20 -> NT29 NT2\nLine 21: NT14 -> NT26 NT17\nWait, but that's a different NT14.\n\nBut for NT23, the rules are:\n\n1. NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n2. NT23 -> NT6 NT9\n3. NT23 -> NT20 NT4\n4. Also, looking at line 24: NT23 -> NT9 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is a sequence of tokens ending with 't' followed by numbers, like t91, t23, etc. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I should remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see S is the start symbol, and all the productions are of the form NT_X \u2192 NT_Y NT_Z, except for the productions ending with 't' letters. Oh wait, the last rule for NT2 is simply 't47', which is a terminal symbol. Similarly, some others like NT15 \u2192 't50', NT2 \u2192 't94', etc. So those NT productions are actually terminal symbols, meaning these are the base cases.\n\nThe string given is a list of these 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, the string starts with t91, then t23, t47, and so on. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left side is two non-terminal symbols. So the derivation process should consist of combining pairs of non-terminals until you reach the terminals, specifically the given string.\n\nBut wait, the string is a linear sequence of terminals. So each step should replace a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals until the entire string is built up.\n\nBut the given grammar has a fixed set of non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals are all the NT... symbols, like NT0, NT1, etc., and some of them produce a single terminal symbol. For example, NT23 produces NT5 and NT25, but NT77 isn't in the grammar; no, looking at the rules, like NT24 \u2192 t1, so those are terminals.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let's start by understanding what this grammar represents. The given production rules seem quite extensive. Each NT production either breaks down into two other NTs or ends with a 't' ending. \n\nThe starting symbol is S, which according to the rules, is transformed into different combinations of NT... symbols. For example, one of the rules is S \u2192 NT23 NT47, which would produce t47 and t23, but looking at the rules, actually, NT47 is a terminal symbol? Wait, the rules go up to NT61 or something, not sure. But in the given string, we see t91, t23, etc., so I need to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps a better approach is to look at the string and see if each 't' in it can be generated by some NT production, and if the sequence of these can be connected via the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t91, t23, t47, t47, t28, t82, t26, t69, t21, t91, t91, t82, t26, t18, t80, t92, t59, t78, t50, t29, t47, t97, t80, t42, t21, t42, t94, t69, t74, t59, t80, t50, t80, t50, t91, t74.\n\nEach of these is a terminal symbol. So, to check if the string is in the language, each 't...' must have a corresponding NT production that ends with that 't'.\n\nLooking at the NT productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT20 \u2192 t97\n- NT4 \u2192 t22 or t59 (for NT18, for example, NT8 \u2192 t91)\nWait, let me list which NTs produce each 't' in the string.\n\n- t91: Look where t is produced. So, the string has t91 multiple times. Looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 t91. So any 't91' must come from NT8.\n\n- t23: Looking for nt productions that result in t23. Checking the rules: NT7 \u2192 t82, etc. Wait, let me check all NT productions that end with 't'.\n\nWait, I think I should create a list of how each NT produces a 't' symbol.\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal productions (those that end with 't') are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t94\nNT4 \u2192 t22 (from rule NT26 \u2192 t22 and others)\nWait, let's list all terminal productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t94 (from rule NT2 \u2192 't94')\n- NT23 \u2192 't49' according to one rule, another says 't69' perhaps?\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-530","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. My goal is to determine whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar. The response should be either 'Yes' or 'No', ending with that. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. It looks like it's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side at maximum. So, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. That simplifies things a bit because it means that when we derive a string, each step either consumes a non-terminal or breaks it down into two smaller non-terminals until we hit terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many symbols like NT23, NT30, etc., have productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols. For instance, NT23 has several productions, some of which directly map to 't' followed by numbers, like 't49', 't69', and others. Some of these production rules directly produce t's, which are terminals, while others produce other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols: \n\n`t86 t47 t69 t78 t91 t26 t1 t47 t59 t28 t21 t1 t62 t82 t74 t1 t42 t59 t97 t50 t92 t82 t59 t97 t42 t28 t74 t97 t26 t59 t18 t62 t78 t94 t29 t97`\n\nMy first observation is that each t is followed by a number, like t86, t47, etc. I need to see if each of these 't's can be derived from the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar rules to see how these terminals are derived. For example, NT23 can produce 't49' directly. Similarly, NT24 can produce 't1'. There are other NT symbols that produce combinations of other NTs, but for the given string, I'm only concerned with the terminal symbols.\n\nI'll go through the string step by step and see if each symbol can be derived from a production rule.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't86'. I need to see if 't86' is a terminal. From the grammar, I see that NT30 can produce 't29', 't80', 't23', etc. Wait, no, actually, NT30 has productions like NT30 -> NT3 NT1, NT30 -> NT10 NT22, and NT30 can eventually produce terminals. For example, NT23 can produce 't49', which is a terminal. But how do we get 't86'? Let's look for a production that directly leads to 't86'. \n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT29 has a production NT29 -> NT29 NT30, but more importantly, looking at the grammar, I see NT29 -> NT29 NT30, NT23 -> NT27 NT16, etc. But perhaps I'm missing where 't86' comes from. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking closely, I see that some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT23 can produce 't49' and 't69', and NT26 can produce 't69'. Let's check if 't86' is a terminal or if it's a derived symbol. Oh, looking back, I don't see any production that directly results in 't86'. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me parse the grammar rules again to see if any NT directly produces 't86'. Scanning through, I don't see any rule where an NT directly becomes 't86'. So, maybe 't86' isn't a terminal in this grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT30 can produce 't29' and 't80', but not 't86'. NT23 can produce 't49' and 't69'. NT25 -> NT30 NT11, but that's two non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Another approach is to check if any NT's production includes 't86' as a result. \n\nHmm, perhaps 't86' is not a terminal, which would mean that the given string has a symbol that cannot be derived from the grammar, making the answer 'No'. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me go through it again.\n\nWait, the grammar uses 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. But I need to see if each 't86', 't47', etc., can be derived. Let me see if any NT directly leads to 't86'. \n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production where an NT leads directly to 't86'. For example, NT29 produces 't29', NT23 produces 't49' and 't69', NT25 -> NT30 NT11, which might lead to non-terminals that eventually produce 't's. But if 't86' is not a terminal in the grammar, then the string has a symbol that can't be generated, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing some rule. Let me check the productions again. Are there any NTs that directly produce 't86'? Looking back at the grammar, I don't see any such rule. So, perhaps 't86' is not possible, making the entire string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's a way to derive the entire string step by step. Let's try starting with the start symbol S and see if we can produce the given string.\n\nBut before that, perhaps I should note that S starts with S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 or other rules. Looking at the given string, it starts with 't86', which I don't see being produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, regardless of the path, that symbol can't be generated, so the string is invalid.\n\nHence, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The syntax looks a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and terminals marked as 't' followed by numbers. My task is to figure out a way to parse the provided string or find a derivation that matches it.\n\nFirst, I should analyze the given grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, the start symbol is S, which branches out into various combinations of NT and numbers, ending with 't' terminals.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of 't' tokens. My goal is to see if this entire string can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals that eventually lead to 't's. Some non-terminals loop back on themselves, like NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6, which might create cycles. But I could end up in an infinite loop if I'm not careful.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation.

But perhaps the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, some of which are recursive.\n\nThe string to check is:\n\n`t42 t74 t1 t86 t1 t74 t74 t69 t94 t23 t94 t23 t50 t59 t49 t18 t62 t92 t94 t82 t59 t62 t49 t50 t21 t86 t92 t80 t59 t26 t97 t86 t1 t97 t42 t50 t59`.\n\nThat's quite a long string. But the key is to find if each 't' terminal can be produced by some non-terminal, and the entire sequence is built up starting from S.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string step by step. Maybe I can list out the parts and see if any production can generate them.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps we can look for patterns or see if all the terms are covered by the grammar.\n\nBut first, I notice that some non-terminals produce multiple terminals, so it's possible for a single production to cover multiple 't's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the string and see if each sequence of 't's can be formed by some combination.\n\nLet me break the string into individual 't' tokens:\n\nt42, t74, t1, t86, t1, t74, t74, t69, t94, t23, t94, t23, t50, t59, t49, t18, t62, t92, t94, t82, t59, t62, t49, t50, t21, t86, t92, t80, t59, t26, t97, t86, t1, t97, t42, t50, t59.\n\nThat's 38 tokens. Considering the complexity of the grammar, it's possible but perhaps not.\n\nSince each production in the grammar is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 t, I can try to step through the derivation.\n\nBut stepping through all 38 tokens manually would be tedious. Instead, maybe I can look for repeated patterns.\n\nLooking at the end, the last token is 't59'. Looking at the grammar, the production NT59 is derived from various non-terminals. For example, in the grammar, NT9 -> NT5 NT2, which can produce 't5' somewhere.\n\nBut this might not help directly. Alternatively, looking for the presence of each 't' in the grammar would help.

{"custom_id":"request-547","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols ending with 't49', 't94', and several others. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals. Non-terminals are on the left side of the arrows, like S, NT23, NT30, etc., while the right sides are combinations of these non-terminals or, importantly, some terminals like 't49', 't62', etc. The terminals are the actual symbols in the string we're evaluating.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t94 t62 t69 t94 t59 t26 t97 t80 t94 t94 t74 t29 t28 t62 t78 t29 t49 t1 t29 t29 t69 t69 t28 t28 t69 t1 t26 t74 t21 t29 t78 t94 t82 t97 t78 t91 t1`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals on the right side are combinations of two other non-terminals. The terminals, on the other hand, are only a few: t49, t59, t62, t69, t74, t78, t80, t91, t94, t97, t26, t28, t49, t94, t21. Wait, actually, looking back, I see that t49, t59, t62, t69, t74, t78, t80, t91, t94, t97, t26, t28 are all terminals, but some seem to repeat, like t49 appears multiple times.\n\nThe problem is that in a CNF grammar, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. In this grammar, I notice that all the right-hand sides are two non-terminals, except for a few that have a mix or something. Wait, let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see production rules like S \u2192 NT24 NT24, which is two non-terminals. But then I see some rules that end with terminals, like NT5 -> NT15 NT8, etc., but in the given grammar, all the production rules seem to be of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ; no rule directly produces a terminal. So perhaps there are some terminals in the grammar, but I need to check if any production rules directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the right-hand sides are all combinations of non-terminals. For example, S -> NT24 NT24, which is two non-terminals. There's no rule like NT24 -> 't1' directly; instead, NT24 is further expanded into NT5 NT19. So the initial non-terminals must eventually expand into terminals.\n\nWait, but in the provided string, I see that there are symbols like 't49', 't62', etc., which would have to be the result of a production where the non-terminal eventually expands to a terminal. So I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any rules that directly produce a terminal like 't49' or 't94' directly. All the production rules on the right-hand side are non-terminals. So for the grammar to generate a terminal string, each non-terminal in the sequence must eventually reduce to a terminal.\n\nSo the string given has a sequence of terminals, but without any non-terminals in between. That suggests that the string must be entirely composed of terminals derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any production rules that directly produce a terminal. So perhaps the terminals in the string can only be produced by non-terminals that do. For example, the non-terminals like NT24 must derive to a terminal string.\n\nBut without any rules for directly generating terminals, the only way the string could be generated is if each symbol in the string can be derived by a sequence of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look through the grammar to see if any non-terminals directly produce terminals or if all non-terminals are composed of other non-terminals. Looking through the given grammar, many of them expand into two non-terminals, but none seem to produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the last symbols in the grammar are of the form like NT17 -> 't19' or other such productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the given rules, yes, there are some that directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT23 -> 't49', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT16 -> 't59', NT26 -> 't23', NT30 -> 't29', etc. So these are production rules where the non-terminal is replaced by a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, the entire derivation would involve starting from the start symbol, S, and using production rules to expand into a series of non-terminals, eventually, through a chain of expansions, producing a terminal string.\n\nBut in the given string, the string is a sequence of terminals with no non-terminals. So each symbol in the string must be derived directly or indirectly from a chain of expansions.\n\nSo the task is to determine if the given string can be formed by starting with S and applying the grammar rules to eventually get the given string.\n\nOne approach is to work backwards from the given string and see if it can be parsed according to the grammar. This is like checking if the string is a leftmost derivation of S. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can think of it as a tree where each non-terminal has exactly two children (the two non-terminals on the right-hand side of the production) until we reach terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, all productions have two non-terminals, but some are direct terminals. Wait, no, in the grammar as presented, all production rules have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT24 NT24 is a production with two non-terminals. However, I also notice that some rules like NT24 -> NT5 NT19 are non-terminals. So each non-terminal must derive a string of terminals, either directly or through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, are there any rules that produce a single terminal? Let me check again. Looking at the end of the provided grammar, I see rules like NT23 -> 't49', NT16 -> 't59', NT26 -> 't23', NT30 -> 't29', NT7 -> 't82', NT26 -> 't69', NT30 -> 't86', NT15 -> 't74', NT24 -> 't42', NT16 -> 't59', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT23 \u2192 't49' is a production where NT23 is replaced by the terminal 't49'. So this would mean that when expanding NT23, the resulting string adds 't49'. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT16 \u2192 't59' and so on.\n\nThis is important because terminals must come from a direct production of a non-terminal that expands into that terminal.\n\nSo now, let's look at the given string and see if its symbols can be generated by such a grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt94 t62 t69 t94 t59 t26 t97 t80 t94 t94 t74 t29 t28 t62 t78 t29 t49 t1 t29 t29 t69 t69 t28 t28 t69 t1 t26 t74 t21 t29 t78 t94 t82 t97 t78 t91 t1\n\nThis is a very long string, and the first thing I notice is that all the symbols are terminals, but the question is whether they can be derived from the given non-terminals.\n\nSince each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A and B, C are non-terminals, the string must form a left (or right) association where each pair forms a component, so for a string of length n, we must have n-1 production steps.\n\nBut for context-free grammars in CNF, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree must equal k-1, where k is the length of the string.\n\nHowever, the grammar may have a structure that allows such a derivation.\n\nBut perhaps the best way to proceed is to attempt to parse the string from left to right, using the available production rules.\n\nAlternatively, since all non-term"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, but the string ends with t59. Did I miss a production? Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see in the grammar that NT15 \u2192 't50', which is a terminal. Other terminals like t26, t49, etc., correspond to specific non-terminals. But I don't see a production that directly leads to t59. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t1 (but maybe that's from elsewhere).

Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 t1, but does any non-terminal produce t59? Looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT producing t59. Unless it's a typo or I'm misreading. Wait, perhaps t59 is from NT17. Let me check NT17's productions. Oh, I see NT17 -> NT23 NT2, but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps it's from another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long and contains a token that can't be derived from any rule. For example, if somewhere a token like t92 occurs, we need to see if that's a terminal. Looking at the grammar, does any production give t92? It seems not. Let me confirm.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT \u2192 t92. Similarly, t91 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT11 \u2192 t18, which doesn't produce t91. So, t91 might not be in the language, but wait, the grammar includes some 't' productions with non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t91 is not a terminal but derived from a non-terminal.

The string includes 't91', which is not listed as a terminal in any production. Therefore, 't91' must be a non-terminal production step.\n\nLooking deeper, in the grammar, there's NT11 \u2192 t18, not t91. Wait, is there a production that leads to t91? Hmm, I don't see it.

Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals and their productions, I don't see any rule that produces t91.

The string is: `t59 t94 t69 t69 t97 t86 t49 t28 t97 t91 t78 t1 t1 t1 t94 t74 t47 t94 t1 t18 t50 t91 t26 t92 t59 t82 t23 t21 t23 t26 t92 t1 t74 t78 t29 t42 t59 t74`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and see which terminals and non-terminals are present. The terminals are words ending with 't' followed by numbers, like 't59', 't78', etc. The non-terminals are words like S, NT23, NT30, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production rules for S are:\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these right-hand sides has two non-terminals each, so each S production will eventually reduce to a sequence of two non-terminals, which in turn will produce the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't59', which appears at the end of some production. I need to map which production rules can start with 't59'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals mentioned are t59, t94, t69, etc. Now, checking the production rules, t59 appears in NT16, NT24, NT74, etc. But looking deeper, in the grammar, 't59' is the terminal from NT16, which is a production: S -> NT20 NT16, so NT16 is somewhere between S and the string.\n\nWait, no, the grammar has S -> NT20 NT16. So, in the string, 't59' might come from NT16. Looking through the grammar, the production for NT16 is S itself. Wait no, perhaps I should check each production.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT20 has a production NT26 NT30.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree step by step. Let's see.\n\nStarting from the top, S can be expanded into two non-terminals. Let's look for where 't59' appears in the RHS of any production.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT2: 't47'\nNT5: 't26'\nNT9: 't78'\nNT11: 't18'\nNT14: 't26' and 't17' etc.\nNT15: 't50' etc.\nNT16: 't59'? Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking through all the productions, I don't see 't59' as a terminal directly. But in the grammar, some rules end with 't'.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some non-terminals when expanded produce a terminal 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT22 -> 't28'. So, 't28' is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, there's 't59', 't94', etc., which are all terminals. So, I need to find which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example, 't59' is produced by NT16?\n\nWait, let me check: in the grammar, NT16 is S -> NT20 NT16. Is there a production for NT16 that ends in 't59'? Looking through all the productions from NT16, I don't see a direct one. Hmm, perhaps I need to look through each production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build the string backward, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be reduced to the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a tree where the leaves are the terminals and the internal nodes are the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nLet me try to see the structure of the string.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 40 tokens: 't59', 't94', 't69', etc. So, the length is 40.\n\nEach production in the grammar (except the terminals) splits into two non-terminals, and each of those non-terminals can either produce another pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for S to generate the string, it must split into two non-terminals, each of which can split into two non-terminals, and so on, until we reach the terminals at the bottom.\n\nGiven the string length is 40, and each split potentially doubles the number of nodes, let me see how the depth could contribute to the length.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for each terminal and find their possible parents in the grammar.\n\nFor example, let's see where 't59' can come from. Looking through the grammar, NT16 produces 't59'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production NT16 is:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see that NT16 is defined as S -> NT20 NT16.\n\nWait, no, that's the production for S. Wait, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each non-terminal has multiple productions. Looking at the entire list, I'll try to find which non-terminals can produce 't59'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that NT24 has a production NT1 NT9, but I'm not seeing 't59' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look through all the productions again, focusing on terminals:\n\nLooking for 't59', 't94', 't69' etc.\n\nI see that NT2 starts with 't47', NT5 has 't26', NT9 has 't78', NT14 has 't21', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps 't59' comes from NT20 or NT16.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19 --> which would produce NT5 and NT19\n- NT19 has productions like NT23 NT27, which in turn produce NT23 and NT27.\n- NT23 could produce 't82' and NT16.\n\nWait, or perhaps I should find the production for NT20:\n\nNT20 has:\n- NT26 NT30\n- NT24 NT5\n- NT5 NT20\n- NT17 NT8\n- NT26 NT30\n\nWait, perhaps stepping through the productions is too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to note that each non-terminal is a tree node, and each production leads towards the terminals. So, perhaps I can reverse the process, starting from the string and trying to reduce it down to S.\n\nLet me list the string again:\n\nt59 t94 t69 t69 t97 t86 t49 t28 t97 t91 t78 t1 t1 t1 t94 t74 t47 t94 t1 t18 t50 t91 t26 t92 t59 t82 t23 t21 t23 t26 t92 t1 t74 t78 t29 t42 t59 t74.\n\nThat's 40 tokens. Since each production step replaces one non-terminal with two, the start symbol S must produce a structure that, when expanded, results in 40 tokens. But considering that each production increases the number of symbols, but in the case of terminals, they remain as single tokens.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's complex to manually parse this. Maybe I should count the number of symbols and see if it's a multiple of certain numbers.\n\nEach S production splits into two non-terminals. Each of those can split further or produce a terminal. The total number of terminals depends on how deep the parse goes.\n\nFor example, if the parse tree has a depth of k, the number of leaves (terminals) is 2^k if all non-terminals produce two non-terminals at each step.\n\nIn this string, there are 40 terminals, so 2^k =40? That doesn't fit since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64. So 40 isn't a power of 2. Therefore, there must be some nodes that expand into only terminals early, so that the total number of leaves is not a perfect power of 2.\n\nFor example, a parse tree that has a depth of 5 with some branches stopping early.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parse tree, it's hard to confirm. Maybe I should instead check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me try to pick a few terminals and see if their parent non-terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nStart with 't59'. Where can 't59' come from?

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I need to parse step by step. Let me first understand the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar looks like it's in CNF, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except possibly the start symbol. I see the start symbol S, and from S, there are several productions, each breaking S into two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS can go to NT23 NT5, NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nThen, there are a lot of rules for different NT symbols (like NT23, NT30, NT17, etc.). Each of these eventually terminals, which are 't' followed by numbers, like t47, t59, etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these terminals: t80, t59, t21, t94, t18, t97, t80, t26, t94, t23, t50, t62, t80, t47, t50, t92, t50, t74, t42, t94, t47, t59, t80, t23, t28, t82, t28, t50, t28, t21, t1, t78, t69, t42, t82, t21, t69, t28, t74.\n\nSince each production in the grammar splits a non-terminal into two, to generate the string, the derivation must eventually reduce each symbol in the string to terminals through a series of productions.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using a top-down or bottom-up approach, but given the complexity, I'll try to manually check if each step can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by splitting the string into individual tokens:\n\n[t80, t59, t21, t94, t18, t97, t80, t26, t94, t23, t50, t62, t80, t47, t50, t92, t50, t74, t42, t94, t47, t59, t80, t23, t28, t82, t28, t50, t28, t21, t1, t78, t69, t42, t82, t21, t69, t28, t74]\n\nNow, I need to see if each token in the string is a result of the grammar's productions. Let's see which tokens correspond to which NTs.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are things like t80, t50, t74, etc. I'll map each terminal to the NT production:\n\n- t47 is used in several productions, like NT26 \u2192 t69, and others.\n- t21 appears in NT1\u2019s production and in the string as a terminal.\n- t50 is a terminal, which likely comes from NT15 \u2192 t50.\n- t80 comes from NT20 \u2192 t97, and others.\n- t97 is part of the string as a terminal. Looking back, does any NT production produce t97? Not directly; t97 is a terminal, but in the grammar, NT23 \u2192 t50, etc., so perhaps t97 is a terminal that comes from an NT production. Wait, let me check the grammar: There is NT26 \u2192 't69', but does any NT produce t97? Or is t97 just a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar rules, I don't see any NT that goes to t97. Instead, t97 is in the string as a terminal. That suggests that the only way t97 arises is if some NT can produce it directly, but looking through the grammar, does any NT have t97 as its direct result? No. That might be an issue because that would imply that t97 is not generated by any NT rule, so the string can't be generated unless t97 is a terminal not defined in the grammar. But that would mean the answer is No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Some of these terminals might be produced by multiple NTs, but I need to check if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t97 comes from the start symbol's production. Looking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So for example, S \u2192 NT20 NT16 would produce t97 and t59 as terminals, but in the string, t59 is the second token, and t97 is the fourth. Wait, but perhaps S can be part of the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t97 comes from a specific NT production. Let's see.\n\nLooking through the terminal lists:\n\nt50 appears in several NTs: NT15 \u2192 t50, NT1 \u2192 t78, etc.\n\nt80 appears in NT20 \u2192 t97, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reverse-engineer how each token could come from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token: t80.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, we see that NT20 \u2192 t97, but that doesn't give t80. Wait, no: the productions for NT20 include NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5, which eventually might produce some terminals. But wait, maybe I need to find an NT that can produce t80 directly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT28 \u2192 't23' is in one rule, but looking for a production that gives t80, maybe not directly. Alternatively, t80 appears in some productions as right-hand sides:\n\nLooking at NT1 \u2192 't78', which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT2 \u2192 't62', another terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the way to look is at each production's right-hand side. For example, if an NT has a production that ends in a terminal, then that NT can produce that terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\nNT5 has an NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17, etc., but if any of these produce terminals as r.h.s., then NT5 can derive that terminal.\n\nWait, let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the list, I need to find if any production's right-hand side is a single terminal. Because each production is A \u2192 BC, but in the string, all the tokens are individual terminals, so each step of expansion must reduce two non-terminals into two terminals or further non-terminals, until the entire string is consumed.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can check for the presence of t97 in the string, since t97 is a token.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any NTs produce t97 as their r.h.s.? I don't see any. For instance, look through all the rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5,\n\nLooking through the rest, I don't see any NT that goes to 't97' as a sole terminal.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to derive t97 from any NT production in the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't97' which cannot be derived by the grammar, so the answer must be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nThe string is: t80 t59 t21 t94 t18 t97 t80 t26 t94 t23 t50 t62 t80 t47 t50 t92 t50 t74 t42 t94 t47 t59 t80 t23 t28 t82 t28 t50 t28 t21 t1 t78 t69 t42 t82 t21 t69 t28 t74.\n\nHmm, the token 't97' is at position 6 (0-based: 5). So if this is a failure because the grammar can't produce t97, then the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.

{"custom_id":"request-563","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens, and the grammar consists of several production rules. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that all the non-terminal symbols (like S, NT23, NT30, etc.) have production rules that either expand into two other non-terminals or directly into the terminals (like 't28', 't49', etc.). The start symbol is S, which produces combinations of NT23 and NT5. Each NT symbol eventually leads to a series of expansions until it reaches a terminal.\n\nThe string in question is long and consists of a lot of 't's followed by numbers. The question is whether this particular sequence can be generated by the given grammar. I'll need to analyze how the string can be constructed by following the production rules.\n\nLet's start by looking at the structure of the grammar and the string. The string begins with 't28 t50', which I need to check if they can be derived from any non-terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, 't28' appears in several production rules for some NT symbols, like NT21 (-> NT23 NT28), NT15 (-> NT23 NT6), NT23 (-> NT27 NT16), etc. Similarly, 't50' is a terminal that appears in NT15 (-> NT23 NT24 NT15 becomes 't50'), and as the terminal 't50', in NT15's production.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar includes direct productions like NT15 -> 't50' and NT2 -> 't94', etc. So each non-terminal can produce a terminal or two other non-terminals.\n\nSince the string is complex, maybe I can approach this by trying to parse it backward, starting from the start symbol S and trying to expand it into the sequence of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals that match the production rules.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this might be cumbersome. Maybe I can check if the grammar can generate a string that starts with 't28 t50...'. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I can see that some NT symbols lead directly to 't28'. For example, NT28 could be 't28' (but looking through the rules, I don't see NT28 directly as a terminal. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar provided, I see that NT28 has some productions into NT4 and NT23, NT7, etc., but looking for actual terminals, the list shows that 't28' appears as a terminal in several places, such as NT21 -> 't47' (not relevant), but wait: let me scan the grammar again. Oh, 't28' is a terminal, and I remember that NT26 can produce 't28' (NT26 -> 't28'). Similarly, NT7 produces 't7' which isn't relevant here, but other terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t28 t50. So, the first part of the string should correspond to a production that includes t28 and t50. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t28 followed by something else leading to t50.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT28 can produce 't28' and some non-terminals, but looking for NT productions, let's consider if any NT symbol can produce t28 t50 as the first two symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can expand into NT23 NT5, and then NT23 and NT5 can produce the t28 t50 t42... part.\n\nWait, let's think about what NT23 can produce. Looking at the rules, NT23 can produce NT27 NT16. Let's see what NT27 and NT16 produce. NT27 is a terminal 't27'? No, wait: the grammar has NT27 -> NT4 NT26. Oh, so NT27 doesn't produce a terminal directly but leads into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the list of non-terminals, NT27 -> NT22 NT8, but looking for actual terminals, the grammar has NT26 -> 't23'? Let me check again: in the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT26 -> NT8 NT26 or NT26 -> NT4 NT29 or NT26 -> 't23'? Wait, no, NT26 has a production with 't23'\u2014no, looking at the grammar input, each rule is of the form NTx -> ... or NTx -> 'tX'. Wait, no, the grammar includes lines like NT26 -> NT12 NT7, NT26 -> NT8 NT26, NT6 -> NT17 NT3, and so on. Also, looking through the list, I find occurrences like NT28 -> NT20 NT18, NT4 -> 't26', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar given, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't26'.\n\nAh, there's a direct production where NT26 becomes 't26'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, looking through the grammar, I find:\n\nNT15 -> 't50'\n\nSo, NT15 can directly produce 't50'.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it starts with t28 t50. So perhaps the first part of the string corresponds to NT28 (which expands into t28 and something else) followed by NT15 (which becomes t50).\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of symbols, so each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of symbols. So, starting with 't28 t50', maybe the first production is S -> NT23 NT5, and then NT23 and NT5 must produce sequences leading to t28 t50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can produce NT23 NT24.\n\nWait, let's try to find the production chain that would lead to the string starting with t28 followed by t50.\n\nLooking for an NT symbol that can produce 't28' and then somehow leads to 't50' as the next symbol. Alternatively, the production could have NT28 producing 't28' and then something that produces 't50'.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT28 can only produce 't28' directly. So, for the first part, to get 't28' after S, perhaps the S is NT23 NT5, and one of these NTS produce 't28'. So, which NT can produce 't28'?\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see:\n\nNT26 -> 't26'\n\nNT15 -> 't50'\n\nNT7 -> 't7'\n\nNT8 -> 't8'\n\nNT22 -> 't28' (from NT22's production?)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines:\n\nYes, I see NT22 -> 't28'. So NT22 can produce 't28'.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 is in multiple productions, some leading to terminals.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't28 t50 t42...'. So perhaps the string starts with NT22 (-> 't28') followed by NT15 (-> 't50').\n\nSo the start symbol S would need to produce NT22 and NT15.\n\nBut looking at the rules, S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, none of the S rules directly produce NT22 NT15. But perhaps we need to expand NT22 and NT15 further into other non-terminals that eventually produce those terminals.\n\nWait, but how can S produce NT22? Because S initially can only produce combinations of NT23 and NT5 (from the first production). So, that approach might not be direct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S can expand into NT20 NT6, and then NT20 can produce something, followed by NT6.\n\nWait, let's see: S -> NT20 NT16.\n\nThen NT20 can produce NT9 NT8 or NT6 NT8 or other options. Wait, looking at the productions for NT20:\n\nNT20 -> NT5 NT20\n\nNT20 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT20 -> NT6 NT8\n\nSo, wait, I think the rules are:\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT20 is defined as:\n\nNT20 -> NT5 NT20\n\nNT20 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT20 -> NT6 NT8\n\nSo, to expand NT20, it can go to NT5 NT20 (which has to expand more), or NT9 NT8, which are NT9 and NT8, or NT6 NT8.\n\nSo, let me try a possible expansion.\n\nStarting with S -> NT20 NT16.\n\nThen"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-577","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, first, let's recall that context-free grammars use production rules where each rule has a single non-terminal on the left. So, the grammar here is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see a mix of productions. Some of them like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 have non-terminals on the right, others like NT7 -> 't49' have terminals. So, it's in CNF? CNF for context-free grammars requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals. But wait, the presence of terminals in the RHS means that it's not strictly in CNF because in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions should have two non-terminals. Oh, but I think the way it's written here, maybe some have more, but seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so any terminals in the RHS mean it's not CNF because the productions here include terminals. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, but regardless, I have to process it as given. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the user intended it as CNF. But I shouldn't focus on that; the key is the process.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t1 t21 t74 t47 t29 t91 t49 t42 t86 t29 t1 t42 t21 t92 t1 t82 t97 t23 t82 t42 t47 t86 t23 t29 t82 t86 t80 t86 t26 t23 t62 t78 t91 t26 t47 t82 t47 t59 t23 t50`.\n\nFirst, I notice that some rules have a terminal and a non-terminal, like S \u2192 NT24 NT24 and NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. Wait, no, some have terminals, others don't. For example, S has productions leading to non-terminals, while NT7 -> 't49' has a terminal.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, the string consists of terminals, so I need to track the possible derivations that produce the string. Since the grammar is a context-free one, with various non-terminals producing other non-terminals or terminals, I can try to analyze the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, processing the string requires starting from S and expanding it, ensuring each part matches the productions. Since the string starts with t1, let's look at which NT can produce t1.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT24 \u2192 t1. So if we have t1, it could come from NT24.\n\nNext, after t1, we have t42. Looking at NT24's production: NT24 \u2192 t1 | t42 | ... Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t1, but does it produce t42? Let me scan the productions:\n\nLooking, for example, the production S \u2192 NT24 NT24, NT24 \u2192 t1, but in another production, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19. Wait, maybe I missed that. Let me check: No, I think NT24 has both t1 and another rule like NT5 NT19 which may lead to more non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the complete list:\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\n\nAnd so on. Hmm, but in the string, after t1 t21 comes t74, which is 't74'. Let me check if any NT produces 't74':\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to 't74'. Wait, let me check again. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice several 't' productions, like NT2 -> t94, NT5 -> t26, etc. But 't74' is present, but it's not in the RHS of anything. Wait, looking back, yes, there's a rule:\n\nIn the list, I see NT7 -> 't49', and NT15 is 't50', etc. Wait, does any non-terminal directly produce 't74'? Looking through all the non-terminal rules, I don't see any production like X -> 't74'. Because all the rules either produce non-terminals or terminals, but I don't see 't74' appearing as a terminal in any.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production after the NT has either non-terminals or a 't'... For example, NT7 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal. No 't74' in there. So, if 't74' is part of the string, how can it be derived? Because in the grammar, no non-terminal expands directly into 't74'. So, perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar. That would immediately imply 'No', unless 't74' can be derived through multiple steps from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but without any production leading to 't74', seems impossible. Unless the start symbol S can somehow derive 't74' through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps in one of the longer productions. Let me see: S has productions leading to NT23 NT24. Then, NT23 can have various rules. NT23's rules include:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\n...\nWait, but none of these lead to 't74' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps via other non-terminals. Let me think, NT7 can produce 't49', and perhaps through some chain leading to 't74', but I don't see any path. Because 't74' is a specific terminal, and unless it's directly produced by some non-terminal, it can't be generated.\n\nSo, in the string, 't74' appears, which cannot be expanded, as no non-terminal in the grammar directly expands to 't74'.

This usually makes parsing easier, as we can apply the CYK algorithm or similar methods. However, I'm not familiar enough with all the details of this specific grammar, so I'll need to approach this step-by-step.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the starting non-terminal is S. The initial productions from S are:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT5\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nThese seem to be the primary branches the derivation can take. Each of these rules has two non-terminals, and each of those can potentially produce the sequence of terminals given in the string.\n\nThe string is a series of 't' suffixed numbers. I need to check whether these are terminals or non-terminals in the grammar. Looking back, non-terminals are usually capitalized, and terminals appear as lowercase with numbers. So 't74' is a terminal, 'NT23' is a non-terminal, etc.\n\nI can start by mapping the string into segments that correspond to the productions. Since it's a series of terminals, I'm looking for how each part of this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't74', I need to find if it's the terminal result of any production. In the grammar rules, 't74' is a terminal. Looking at the rules, I see that 't74' is the result of NT15 \u2192 't74'. So if NT15 is part of the derivation, the terminal would be 't74'.\n\nWait, but looking at the rule NT15 \u2192 't74'\u2014does that mean that NT15 can produce only 't74'? Yes, so in any derivation, if we have NT15, that must eventually lead to 't74'.\n\nSimilarly, 't92'\u2014let's see where that comes from. Looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for 't92' except possibly in the rules where terminals like 't92' appear on the right-hand side. Checking, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't92' as a terminal, except perhaps in a chain of productions. Wait, in the rules, I see that 't92' is a terminal. So NT17 \u2192 't92', NT20 \u2192 't97', etc.\n\nI need to find a way to derive the string `t74 t92 t26 t21 t80 t42 t97 t86 t86 t49 t94 t94 t23 t47 t21 t82 t78 t69 t47 t92 t49 t59 t28 t42 t62 t21 t91 t28 t78 t86 t28 t59 t42 t49 t18 t47 t78 t74 t23 t28`.\n\nEach part is a terminal, so the entire string must be the result of expanding all non-terminals step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols. So the overall string's length should be 2^n -1, where n is the number of productions. But the string's length here is quite long\u2014it's 41 symbols. So 41 would need to be 2^n -1, but 2^6=64, 64-1=63, not 41. So perhaps the tree is not a full binary tree, which is possible, but the exact structure would be needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into the order of the productions. Since each symbol is a terminal, I can try to see if each symbol can be derived in sequence from the start symbol.\n\nBut manually tracing each step might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe looking for some patterns or repeated symbols that can point to certain production rules.\n\nFor example, the string starts with 't74' followed by 't92'. From the rules, 't74' comes from NT15, and 't92' comes from NT17. So perhaps a path that involves NT15 and NT17 at the beginning. But looking at the initial productions from S, none of them directly involve NT15 or NT23 initially. So maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT5.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT23 NT5, then from NT23, we can have 't74', and from NT5, perhaps?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT5 can produce 't26' and 't49' via NT23. Wait, actually, in the rules, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. Let me check: NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. So if I have NT23, it's two NTs again. But in the string, the first symbol is 't74', which comes from NT15. But S's first production is NT23 NT5, so how can we get 't74' as the first symbol?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see. The string is t74 t92 t26 t21 t80... So 't74' is the first symbol. So I need to find a way that the first two symbols come from expanding S into NT something that produces 't74' and something else.\n\nBut S's productions start with NT23 and NT5. So perhaps, in S \u2192 NT23 NT5, the NT23 can produce t74, but then the NT5 would have to produce the rest of the string. However, the second symbol is t92, which comes from NT17. So maybe NT5 can lead to t92.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8. So NT5 can expand into NT15 and NT8. Then, NT15 \u2192 't74', and NT8 \u2192 't92'. So that could explain the first two symbols.\n\nSo that path would be S \u2192 NT23 NT5 \u2192 (NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8) \u2192 't74' 't92'. Then the third symbol is 't26'. So after that, we have to see how NT23 can produce 't26'.\n\nLooking at NT23, it can expand into NT5 NT25, which would produce NT5 and NT25. But NT25 is a non-terminal, I need to see what it can produce.\n\nLooking back, NT25 is part of NT23's production: NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. So when NT23 is expanded, it produces NT5 and NT25. So the next part after 't74 t92' would be 't26', which is the result of NT25 expanding into 't26'.\n\nLooking for NT25's productions. I don't see an NT25 in the given rules. Hmm, maybe I'm going wrong somewhere. Wait, looking at the rules provided, I don't see NT25 as a defined non-terminal, so perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, no, the rules provided do include some 'NT' rules, but perhaps NT25 is part of the rules? Let me check through the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the 'NT' entries, I see NT23, NT20, NT17, NT20, etc., but not NT25. Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, the rules end with:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT97 NT86\nNT18 \u2192 NT92 NT22\nNT12 \u2192 NT29 NT9\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\nNT27 \u2192 NT2 NT23\nNT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT4 NT19\nNT10 \u2192 NT19 NT12\nNT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT21 \u2192 NT5 NT14\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT5\nNT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0\nNT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25\nNT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22\nNT12 \u2192 NT18 NT28\nNT7 \u2192 NT23 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me first recall what I know about CNF. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems each production starts with a non-terminal on the left, and on the right, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT24 NT24 or S \u2192 NT5, and so on. The terminals are things like 't26', 't29', etc. So the grammar is in CNF, which is good because it makes parsing easier, but I'm not going to use a parser; I have to manually check if the string follows this grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t26 t29 t28 t1 t29 t69 t47 t94 t49 t78 t80 t86 t28 t49 t94 t50 t80 t86 t97 t74 t80 t69 t29 t49 t62`. That's a lot of terms! Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar's start symbol is S. So according to the grammar, S can produce two non-terminals each time, and those non-terminals can further produce other non-terminals or terminals. So, the string should be built by breaking everything down starting from S.\n\nLet's start by looking for S in the grammar. However, I don't see S directly producing 't26' or any of the terminals in the given string, except perhaps through the intermediate non-terminals. Let me see the productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S doesn't directly produce any terminal. Instead, S \u2192 NT24 NT5 or NT20 NT16, etc. So S is not a terminal and must be built from other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the given string, the last token is 't62', which is a terminal. So the string starts with 't26' which is a terminal, but in the grammar, S doesn't produce 't26' directly. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar has rules like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, and others. The terminals in the string are things like t26, t28, etc. These must be produced by some non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps 't26' is produced by a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I check all the productions to see if any of the non-terminals directly produce t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 -> NT0 NT3\n- NT2 -> NT25 NT19\n- NT5 -> NT15 NT8\n- NT7 -> NT24 NT6\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT28\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT11 -> NT15 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT12 NT22\n- NT14 -> NT21 NT22\n- NT15 -> NT30 NT1\n- NT17 -> NT19 NT2\n- NT18 -> NT10 NT26\n- NT19 -> NT6 NT19\n- NT20 -> NT26 NT30\n- NT21 -> NT21 NT28\n- NT22 -> NT23 NT11\n- NT23 -> NT9 NT4\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT25 -> NT30 NT11\n- NT26 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT27 -> 't49'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT29 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT22\nWait, hold on, some of these are terminals. For example, NT27 -> 't49', so t49 is a terminal. But in the string, the last token is t62. So, perhaps I missed a production that leads to t62.\n\nLooking through more rules:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\nNT15 -> NT2 NT8\nNot seeing t62 yet.\n\nWait, let me check the rules further. \n\nLooking at the top-level non-terminals, S produces NT24 NT24 or other combinations. So each production of S starts with an S and has two non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but in the string given, only terminals are present\u2014no non-terminals like NT25 or anything else. That seems odd because every step in the grammar must involve replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals or terminals. So the initial symbols after S are non-terminals according to the grammar, but in the given string, they're all terminals, meaning the reduction might not have been completed yet.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the string only contains terminals, unless all non-terminals have been expanded into terminals. For example, maybe the string is entirely built by replacing all non-terminals with their corresponding terminals.\n\nBut let me check the grammar's terminals. Let's look for any non-terminals that produce terminals other than the ones in the string.\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't24' and 't6'? Wait, checking again:\n\nWait, looking through the production rules:\n\nWait, maybe I misread that. Let me check each non-terminal:\n\nWait, looking through each rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT15 \u2192 NT30 NT1\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30\n- NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n- NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT30\n- NT19 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n- Some others like NT17, NT4, etc., produce combinations.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any rule that immediately produces t26 or t29 directly. Wait, hold on, looking again:\n\nWait, under NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2\nUnder NT19: NT19 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nUnder NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3\nWait, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overlooking some production. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the list of rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80'\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT7 produces NT24 NT6, so 't24' and 't6' perhaps? Let me see if there's a rule that leads to 't26'.\n\nWait, NT26 is produced by NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7, and NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT22. Hmm, that seems like a left recursion. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me try to work backwards from the string and see if the last symbols can be reduced.\n\nThe string ends with t62, but I don't see any production that leads to t62. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, the string does have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, all the symbols in the string are terminals except if any non-terminals were introduced but not expanded.\n\nWait, no, the given string is a flat list of terms, which I think indicates that all the non-terminals have been expanded into terminals.

The string starts with 't26', which is a terminal. So, in the grammar, does any non-terminal expand into 't26'?

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to figure out if a given string can be generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite complex, with a bunch of production rules. The string to check is a series of symbols ending with 't' and some numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how context-free grammars work. Each production rule defines how a non-terminal symbol can be replaced by a combination of other symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. Terminals are the actual symbols in the string, while non-terminals are placeholders that need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level non-terminals are S and NT1 to NT30. The production rules all seem to be of the form Non-terminal -> Non-terminal Non-terminal, except for a few that have terminals at the end.\n\nThe string given is: t59 t62 t29 t74 t23 t94 t92 t91 t78 t50 t1 t42 t42 t29 t28 t62 t62 t18 t59 t21 t49 t97 t78 t97 t23 t80 t94 t42 t94 t91 t21 t59 t92 t78 t59 t1 t18 t92 t49 t47 t49.\n\nI notice that all the symbols start with 't', but looking at the grammar, some non-terminals like S and NT23 produce t followed by numbers. For example, NT15 \u2192 t50, NT24 \u2192 t1, and so on. So the given string being a collection of 't' followed by numbers suggests that each symbol in the string is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, how does the grammar generate such a string? Each production is a step in the derivation, expanding non-terminals until all that's left are terminals.\n\nI need to figure out if the string can be constructed by applying these production rules step by step. But since the string is pretty long (about 41 symbols), it's tedious to do this manually. Instead, I can try to break it down by looking at the possible starting points.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which has multiple production rules. Looking at the given grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT24 NT24\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these produces two non-terminals. For example, if I choose S \u2192 NT24 NT24, then I have to expand each NT24. Similarly, each NT also has production rules.\n\nEach NT can be a non-terminal that might produce a terminal or another non-terminal. For example, NT23 can produce NT5 NT25, but some non-terminals produce terminals like t50, t59, etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the last symbol is t49. Looking at the grammar, NT25 can produce t30 and NT11. But I see that NT11 can produce 't' followed by numbers, as in NT11 \u2192 NT24 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 t19 t2. So it's possible that t18, t49, etc., are terminals.\n\nBut looking at the production rules, the only terminals given are t-something, but I don't see an explicit production where a non-terminal produces a single terminal without involving another non-terminal. So I might be missing something here.\n\nWait, actually, in the production rules, some NTs do produce a terminal plus another non-terminal. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25. But in the string, every symbol is a 't' followed by a number. So perhaps each 'tXY' is a terminal that is generated by a non-terminal that eventually expands to that terminal.\n\nBut how can a non-terminal produce a single terminal, or a terminal with another terminal? Because from the given rules, all NTs seem to split into two non-terminals unless a terminal is in the end. Wait, looking closer, some rules have a terminal at the end. For example, NT15 \u2192 t50. Oh, right, so in the grammar, some non-terminals can produce a single terminal.\n\nWait no, NT15 \u2192 't50' is written as NT15 \u2192 't50', which suggests that NT15 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal symbol 't50' because it's a terminal. So when we have 't50' in the string, that corresponds to a production where a non-terminal (like NT15) is used to generate it.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string:\n\nThe first symbol is t59, which corresponds to NT26 \u2192 't26' (or maybe NT24 \u2192 't1', but I'm not sure yet). Wait, let me check: NT24 \u2192 't1', NT29 \u2192 't82', NT23 \u2192 't42' from NT24 and such.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me see if I can map each 'tXY' to their possible sources.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt59, t62, t29, etc.\n\nLooking up NT25, it produces 't30' and NT11. Maybe I can start from the top and see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a bottom-up approach: is the string made up of terminals that can be generated by the grammar?\n\nBut this is complicated, and since I can't actually perform a full derivation, maybe I can check for any rule that can produce the string or if any substring is not in the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for those that produce terminals directly, like A \u2192 a. But looking at the grammar, I see that some NTs produce single terminals, like NT15 \u2192 't50', so that's acceptable.\n\nBut in the given string, every symbol is a 't' followed by a number, which suggests they're all terminal symbols. So each of these terminals must be produced directly by an NT that has a production rule ending in that terminal.\n\nBut looking for each 'tXY' in the string, is there a non-terminal that can produce that? For example, is there a NT that has a production rule that results in t59? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2, and NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29, etc. Wait, but there's also NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT3, and NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, most NT rules do not directly produce a single 't' symbol unless it's in the form of, for example, NT15 \u2192 't50'. So, for most terminals in the string, we need to find an NT that can produce them through a chain of productions.\n\nBut wait, every terminal in the string is of the form 't' followed by a number. Let's get a list of all these 't' symbols in the string:\n\nt59, t62, t29, t74, t23, t94, t92, t91, t78, t50, t1, t42, t42, t29, t28, t62, t62, t18, t59, t21, t49, t97, t78, t97, t23, t80, t94, t42, t94, t91, t21, t59, t92, t78, t59, t1, t18, t92, t49, t47, t49.\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to see if there's a path from some NT to that terminal. For example:\n\n- t50: NT15 \u2192 t50, so NT15 can produce it.\n- t26 is in NT4 \u2192 't26'.\n\nWait, but in the string, t62 appears multiple times. Let's see if any NT can produce t62.\n\nLooking in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't1' and NT24 also has a rule NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19. Then, NT19 can produce NT29 NT29, but I don't see a direct path to t62 from that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again. NT20 \u2192 't26', and NT26 has some rules like NT26 \u2192 NT22 NT7 or NT23 NT29, but not directly 't62'.\n\nAlternatively, is there any NT that can produce t62? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't62', which is a problem because the string has 't62' as a terminal symbol.\n\nSo if t62 is in the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one. Each non-terminal is on the left.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols: `t47 t91 t29 t23 t28 t78 t49 t28 t62 t62 t86 t59 t29 t69 t62 t80 t92 t69 t26 t23 t1 t1 t18 t28 t21 t74 t49 t47 t91 t59 t42 t82 t23 t74 t92 t18 t28 t26 t42 t49 t47 t78`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar includes a number of productions that directly map to terminals with symbols like t47, t49, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary grammar, so each production breaks down non-terminals into pairs of non-terminals. The process I'll follow is similar to parsing the string using the grammar, checking if each terminal in the string can be matched step by step according to the productions.\n\nLet me list out the productions again for clarity, grouping them by left-hand side (LHS) into non-terminals and their RHS productions.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce five different options:\n\n1. S -> NT24 NT24\nWait, that can't be right. Looking back, the first production is S -> NT23 NT24. Wait, no: the user's grammar starts with S -> NT23 NT24 NT24? Wait no, looking closer, the grammar as presented in the query is:\n\nS-> NT23 NT24 NT24? Wait no: the user's grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production should be two non-terminals, except the start symbol. So perhaps I'm misreading it. Wait, looking closely, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\n\nWait, no, let me check: The user's grammar as written starts with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\n\nNo, actually, looking at the first three productions:\n\n ``` \nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n```\n\nWait, that's not CNF because the first production has three non-terminals on the RHS. That's impossible in CNF because CNF requires RHS to have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal for the start symbol. So perhaps the user made a typo or I'm misinterpreting the notation.\n\nWait, maybe the way the grammar is written uses a different notation, perhaps with '|' meaning alternatives. For example, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24 | NT24, but that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, but in the given, the first production has three, which violates CNF. This is confusing, and perhaps I misread the initial grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's S \u2192 NT23 NT24 | NT24? But that would not make sense because NT24 is a non-terminal, which can have its own productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Then, the grammar would have other productions. Let me try to re-examine the user's grammar correctly.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the user's grammar:\n\nThe first three lines are:\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nWait, three non-terminals on the first RHS, but that's not allowed in CNF. So either the user made a mistake, or perhaps it's a multi-symbol production, but that conflicts with the CNF structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that each production is a bit longer, but I need to consider that the first production might be S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT24, which can't be because CNF requires exactly two non-terminals. This is a problem because it's a three-symbol production, and that's likely incorrect for a CNF grammar.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the user's grammar isn't actually in CNF, which would make the question invalid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which would make sense in CNF.\n\nBut, for the sake of proceeding, let's assume that perhaps it's a typo and the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, and proceed accordingly, but then I might make mistakes in parsing the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step without relying too much on the full grammar, just focusing on the relevant parts.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt47 t91 t29 t23 t28 t78 t49 t28 t62 t62 t86 t59 t29 t69 t62 t80 t92 t69 t26 t23 t1 t1 t18 t28 t21 t74 t49 t47 t91 t59 t42 t82 t23 t74 t92 t18 t28 t26 t42 t49 t47 t78\n\nI notice that it's a sequence of about 44 symbols, but the grammar has many productions that might help in determining how the string parses.\n\nFirst, let's see which terminals are present:\n\n- t47, t91, t29, t23, t28, t78, t49, t62, t86, t59, t69, t80, t92, t69, t26, t23, t1, t18, t21, t74, t42, t82, t78.\n\nLooking at these, the t's have subscripts. For example, t59, t69, etc. Looking back at the grammar, I can see that some of these t's are produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example, look at rules where NT22 produces t28:\n\nNT22 -> t28\n\nAnd NT20 produces t97, t18, etc. Wait, no: looking through the grammar, some non-terminals are directly connected to terminals.\n\nLooking at each rule's RHS and seeing if any of them produce a 't' symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT22 has a production:\n\nNT22 -> t28\n\nSimilarly, NT4 -> t26, NT20 -> t18, etc.\n\nLet me list the rules that directly produce terminals (i.e., the ones without further decomposition into non-terminals):\n\n- NT22 -> t28\n\n- NT4 -> t26\n\n- NT5 -> t26\n\n- NT20 -> t18\n\n- NT21 -> t21\n\nLooking more carefully, perhaps other NTs produce terminals:\n\nWait, some NTs have productions that include a single terminal mixed with non-terminals, but given that all non-terminals must be processed further, mixing terminals with non-terminals would mean that such a production can only produce strings that include a specific terminal at the tip. For example, a production like NT -> a NT would generate a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which would not reach a terminal unless another production is applied. But in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must produce two non-terminals, so perhaps the terminals in the string must correspond to the leaves of the derivation.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, most of the NTs have productions that are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal that produces a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT20 -> NT26 NT30\n\n- NT23 -> NT23 NT21, NT19 NT29\n\nBut others like NT5 -> NT10 NT17, which may produce further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find a path through the grammar that builds the string step by step. Since the string is a linear sequence of terminals, the derivation must proceed by expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nStarting with S, which can generate strings of non-terminals on the RHS, and each step reduces the length of the derivation by replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but the actual string is built by replacing the top-level non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut without a full parse tree"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-595","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is great because it simplifies some aspects of parsing. Let me start by trying to understand the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, I see it directly produces NT24 NT5. So the string must eventually start with these two non-terminals, which then expand through the rules. The string provided is a series of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' seems to be a terminal, which in this case are the actual terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nWait, I should double-check the grammar. I see that some NT productions end with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT2 -> 't47'. So each 't' like 't47' is a terminal symbol. That means when I parse the string, each token must match these terminals exactly.\n\nThe string starts with t21 t21. Let me see if there's a production that starts with NT21. Scanning the grammar, I find NT21 -> NT10 NT9. So NT21 can only produce two non-terminals. The string starts with t21 t21, so each t21 must come from NT21.\n\nWait, that means each t21 in the string must be generated by NT21, and the production is NT21 -> NT10 NT9. But t21 t21 would mean two consecutive t21s, so wait, the string has t21 t21 t74... So the first t21 is from NT21, which is NT10 NT9. Hmm, no, that might cause an issue because the output would involve more non-terminals that need to expand.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by tracing through the string step by step, expanding each part.\n\nLet me start by looking at the entire string and see how it can break down.\n\nThe string is: t21 t21 t74 t97 t21 t1 t74 t23 t62 t28 t94 t23 t91 t29 t23 t50 t78 t23 t82 t97 t78 t80 t59 t23 t26 t86 t29 t91 t1 t86 t91 t21 t49 t23 t49 t86 t1 t92 t78 t18 t28 t47.\n\nI'll try to group these into meaningful non-terminals. Since each t-suffix number is a terminal, perhaps the non-terminals can be constructed by sequences that reduce to these t's.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the start symbol and see possible expansions that lead to the string.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce multiple NT combinations. Let me list the possible S productions:\n\n1. S -> NT24 NT5\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived from any of these.\n\nLet me check the first production: NT24 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT24 has productions:\n\nNT24 -> NT15 NT8\nBut NT15 -> NT2 NT8, which in turn can break into more non-terminals, but it's complex. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, the first two tokens are t21 t21. Let me see if any non-terminal production starts with t21. Looking at NT21:\n\nNT21 -> NT10 NT9. So each t21 comes from NT21-> NT10 NT9. That would split the string into parts that have to follow NT10 and NT9.\n\nBut wait, the first t21 is from NT21, which gives two non-terminals, so I have to see if the string can structure around that.\n\nWait, actually, each t21 is a terminal, so the production NT21 -> t21 t21 would make sense, but does NT21 have a production that results in t21 twice? No, because in the given grammar, all NT productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, some NT have productions that produce 't-something', like NT2 -> 't47'.\n\nSo for example, NT24 has several productions: NT24 -> NT15 NT8, NT24 -> NT5 NT19, etc. But there's also NT24 -> 't1'. Oh, that's an option. So each NT can produce either non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, NT24 can produce a terminal 't1'. Similarly, looking through the grammar, I see NT21 -> 't91'? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> NT8 NT28\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, after some lengthy listing, the last lines are:\n\n- NT10 -> NT9 NT27\n- NT22 -> NT23 NT11\n- NT23 -> NT27 NT16\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT22\n- NT26 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT27 -> NT4 NT26\n- NT7 -> NT24 NT6\n- NT8 -> NT1 NT28\n- NT23 -> NT16 NT16\n- NT28 -> NT24 NT23\n- NT5 -> NT10 NT17\n- NT26 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT27 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT11 -> 't18'\n- NT2 -> 't62'\n\nWait, so some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT21 -> 't21', which is a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT8 -> 't91', and NT24 -> 't1', etc.\n\nSo the production NT21 can produce just the terminal t21. That's a direct way to get t21 in the string.\n\nSimilarly, I can look for other terminals in the string that are produced by NTs. For example, the string starts with t21 t21 t74 t97... So let's see:\n\nFirst token: t21 is produced by NT21 -> 't21'.\n\nSecond token: t21 again, another NT21 -> 't21'.\n\nThird token: t74. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces t74? From the end of the given grammar, I see that NT15 -> 't50', and NT24 -> 't1', etc. Hmm, looking earlier, there's NT15 -> 't50' and NT24 -> 't1'. Where is t74? Looking through:\n\n- I see 't74' towards the end. Let me find it.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar lines again:\n\nAh, here's NT23 -> 't82', NT7 -> 't82', NT26 -> 't69', NT30 -> 't86', NT15 -> 't74', etc. Wait, looking for 't74' in the NT productions. Oh yeah, line:\n\n- NT23 -> 't82' (I see that)\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- ...\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me check again: in the given grammar, after some lines, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-602","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols including various 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has a specific structure: each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. This means that the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules seem to follow this structure. For example, S -> NT23 NT5 has two non-terminals on the right, and some have a terminal like NT5 -> t49. So the grammar seems correctly in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to figure out if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with t47 and ends with t94, which suggests that the derivation must start by expanding S into these non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking for the initial production rules that might produce t47 or other starting symbols. From the grammar, I see that NT22 produces t28, which isn't in the string, but NT23 produces t69. Alternatively, NT2 -> t94, and NT5 -> t26. Wait, the string starts with t47, so which non-terminals produce t47?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT23 -> t49. So if S expands into NT23 and NT5, and one of them produces t47, that could be a starting point.\n\nWait, the string starts with t47. So let's see if there's a production that directly gives t47. I look through the rules and see NT2 -> t94, which is another terminal. So maybe there's a way to get t47 through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from multiple applications of the production rules. Each step produces a combination of symbols, some non-terminals and some terminals.\n\nSince this can be quite complex, perhaps I should consider using the CYK algorithm to parse the string against the grammar. But given that the string is quite long, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each symbol in the string can be matched through some derivation. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each element must be generated by a rule that produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t47 t97 t49 t91 t23 t86 t26 t26 t42 t18 t21 t86 t62 t62 t29 t80 t50 t26 t50 t86 t50 t69 t23 t92 t42 t80 t94 t47 t94 t69 t82 t49 t69 t94 t69 t21 t21 t86 t49 t69 t29 t82 t69.\n\nI notice that t49 appears multiple times. From the grammar, I see that NT23 -> t49, and NT25 -> NT30 NT11, which in turn might produce t49. Also, NT5 -> t26, which is also in the string.\n\nI should also check if the counts and the order make sense. For example, t47 appears at the start and towards the end. Is there a production that can loop or produce these terminals in the correct sequence?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that NT23 has multiple productions: NT23 -> NT5 NT25 and NT23 -> NT6 NT9, etc. So perhaps the string can branch through these different productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each pair of symbols in the string can be generated by the left-hand sides of the grammar rules. For example, starting from S, which can be replaced by various pairs, and each subsequent pair can be checked against the grammar.\n\nHowever, manually verifying each step would be tedious, especially for such a long string. Perhaps I can look for known problematic areas. For instance, looking for symbols that might not have productions or for which there's no way to derive them.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT15 -> t50, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT2 -> t94, and so on. Wait, but not all terminals are directly derivable from S in one step.\n\nI also notice that the string uses symbols like t26 multiple times, which are produced by NT15 -> t50 (if I'm not mistaken earlier). Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT5 -> t26, and NT2 -> t94, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, t47 appears at the start. So how do we get t47? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT22 giving t47, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, I must check each symbol in the string to see if it can be derived eventually.\n\nLooking up the production rules, I see that some symbols may not appear in the right-hand sides. For example, t78 appears in the grammar as produced by NT23 -> NT4 NT20. Wait, but checking for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some terminals can't be reached because they're only produced by specific rules that aren't triggered by the start symbol S.\n\nWait, for example, t80 is produced by NT2 -> t94, but also by NT24 -> t1, which is a terminal, or NT28 -> t80. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT28 -> t80.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting lost in the details. Maybe a safer approach is to check for any impossible symbols or missing production chains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains symbols that aren't in the grammar's terminal symbols. Wait, looking through, the given string includes t47, t97, t49, t91, etc. But looking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are things like t49, t50, t26, t59, etc., but some of these might not appear at all.\n\nWait, no, t97, for example, is in the string but I don't see it being a terminal in the grammar. Let me check the provided grammar rules. Looking through the list, I don't spot any production that results in t97. The terminals are things like t49, t50, t26, t23, etc.\n\nSo t97 isn't listed anywhere as a terminal. That would mean the string contains a terminal that's not allowed by the grammar, so the string can't be generated. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nLooking back, I see that the grammar includes several 't' rules, like NT22 -> t28, NT24 -> t1, NT5 -> t26, etc. But I don't see t97 being a terminal; perhaps it's a non-terminal. So the string has a symbol that's either not a terminal or a non-terminal that can't be produced.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, only specific 't' symbols are terminals. The others are non-terminals. So if the string contains a 't' that isn't listed as a terminal in the grammar, it's impossible for that string to be generated.\n\nIn this case, the string starts with t47, which I think is a terminal. Let me check if 't47' is present in the terminal production rules. Looking through, I see NT2 -> t94, which is different. Wait, I don't see 't47' in any terminal rules. The productions like NT23 -> t49, NT2 -> t94, but nothing for t47. So if t47 is a terminal in the input, and it's not present in the grammar, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user provided the grammar, and I see in the production rules something like NT23 -> t49. But I don't see any rules for t47, t97, etc. So if the string contains t47, which isn't a terminal in the grammar, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I might have misread the terminals. Let me go through each rule again.\n\nLooking through each production, the terminals are as follows:\n\n- NT23 -> t49\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT15 -> t50\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT28 -> t80\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT30 -> t29\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT2 -> t62\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT30 -> t86 (multiple times)\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT24 -> t42\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT9 -> t78\n- NT11 -> t18\n- NT2 -> t62\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-608","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar looks a bit complex with a lot of production rules, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit since all the rules are of the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal, except some might be a mix, but I need to confirm.\n\nWait, some of the productions have more than two non-terminals on the right side. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Hmm, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the grammar, because Chomsky normal form requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. However, given the structure, I'll proceed under the assumption that it's in CNF, perhaps with left-hand sides as non-terminals and the right-hand sides consisting of either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut looking closer, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11, and NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7. Hmm, no, that's two, so maybe it's okay. Wait, no\u2014most of them are two, like NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, etc. So perhaps the user wrote the grammar correctly, and some of the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, which is allowed in Chomsky normal form as it's a standard form where productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. So A \u2192 BC is fine, but in the given grammar, some rules have longer right-hand sides. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 in the first part, but then later NT23 appears again in other rules. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading. Looking again, I see rules like NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which is two non-terminals, and NT23 also appears in other production rules, like NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, which is also two. So maybe the grammar is correctly presented as per CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t94, t78, t69, etc. I need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nOne approach is to parse the string using the given grammar, trying to find a derivation path from S. Since the grammar is context-free, I can attempt to build a parse tree or use a top-down parsing method.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, it might be easier to look for patterns or see if all the terminals in the string can be derived correctly.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. The initial productions from S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT24 NT24\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can produce combinations of these non-terminals. For example, NT24 and NT24, or NT20 and NT16, etc.\n\nEach of these non-terminals on the right side can then produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nOne thing I notice is that the string starts with t94, which appears in the productions. Let's see where t94 is defined. Looking through the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 t94. So NT2 must eventually derive t94.\n\nSimilarly, the string contains several t's, and each must be matched by some terminal in the grammar.\n\nI think I should try to see if the string can be broken down into the right sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Since the string is quite long, perhaps I can look for recurring patterns or see if the non-terminals correspond correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can start from the end of the string because the last symbol is t49, which I think is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT23 \u2192 t49. So the last symbol t49 must come from NT23. So maybe the end of the string is part of a production that ends with NT23.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct a possible path:\n\nThe last symbol is t6, which is in NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9. So t6 is the second part, and the first part would be NT23. So maybe the string ends with NT23, t9 (t9 is in NT23 \u2192 t6 t9, perhaps), but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is very large, perhaps the string is a concatenation of terminals that can be generated by multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions of the grammar.\n\nBut this approach could take a long time, as the string is quite long. Maybe I can write down the sequence and see if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nAnother thought: since the grammar is given in CNF, perhaps we can model it as a pushdown automaton and simulate the parsing, but that's a more advanced technique.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of terms that can be derived from the grammar, like t94, t78, etc.\n\nWait, t78 is in NT15 \u2192 t78, so that's a terminal. Similarly, t69 is in NT26 \u2192 t69.\n\nI think it's getting too time-consuming to go through each terminal. Maybe I can check if the string's terminal sequence is a possible derivation.\n\nAnother idea: since the grammar has many non-terminals and each can produce other non-terminals, perhaps it's easier to see if each symbol in the string can be found as a terminal in some production.\n\nBut that's not sufficient, because the terminals must appear in the correct order and their derivations must form a contiguous block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to see if each t symbol in the string has at least one production in the grammar that starts with that terminal. For example, t94 is in NT2 \u2192 t94, t78 in NT15 \u2192 t78, t69 in NT26 \u2192 t69, and so on.\n\nBut again, just having a production for each terminal doesn't guarantee that they can be generated in the correct order.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to think of the string in parts. Let's write down the string and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\nt94 t78 t69 t92 t80 t23 t74 t94 t47 t26 t94 t91 t18 t28 t92 t23 t28 t92 t92 t82 t92 t50 t1 t50 t80 t91 t62 t1 t1 t49 t91 t92 t91 t18 t23 t28 t82 t69 t80 t74 t47 t91 t18\n\nThat's a lot of t's. Each t corresponds to a specific production. For example, t94 is NT2, t78 is NT15, t69 is NT26, and so on.\n\nI think the key is to see if the entire sequence can be generated by the grammar, which is quite complex. Since it's a CNF grammar, leftmost derivation is a common approach. Maybe I can attempt to see if the string can be built by following the leftmost derivations.\n\nBut considering the time constraints, perhaps I can look for any obvious conflicts. For example, if the string contains a terminal that is never a terminal in any production, or if two consecutive terminals cannot appear in any production.\n\nLooking through the productions, I can list all the terminals. Let me collect them:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminals (those that appear on the right-hand side as single symbols) are:\n\nt49 (from NT23), t26 (from NT26), t94 (from NT2), t78 (from NT15), t69 (from NT26), t1 (from NT22), t50 (from NT15), t91 (from NT8?), t47 (from NT?), t80 (from?), etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all unique terminals from the grammar. Looking through the productions, the terminals include:\n\nt94, t78, t69, t92, t80, t23, t74, t47, t26, t94, t91, t1, t50, t1, t1, t49, t91, t92, t91, t18, t23, t28, t82, t69, t80, t74, t47, t91, t18"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-609","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to evaluate. My goal is to determine whether the grammar generates that string. The grammar is a bit complex, with multiple productions starting from S and various non-terminals like NT23, NT30, etc. The string to check is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' strings, which I guess are terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form typically has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that most productions are of the form NTsomething \u2192 NTsomething else NTsomething else, except for some that end with letters like 't', which might be terminals. So, the non-terminals seem to consist of abbreviations like NT23, NT30, etc.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like 't91', 't69', and so on, ending with 't92'. Each of these is probably a terminal symbol. So the task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the provided grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol S in the grammar. The first thing I see is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So S expands into two non-terminals. When deriving the string, the start would involve expanding S into these non-terminals, which themselves will expand further.\n\nThe string has a lot of t symbols, which are likely terminals. Since each production might involve these terminals, I need to see if the string can be built step by step from the grammar.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each production seems to consist of mostly non-terminals. The only terminals are at the end of certain productions. For example, NT23 \u2192 't50' or NT27 \u2192 't49'. Wait, so some non-terminals expand directly to a terminal. That's crucial because it means the derivation will involve certain terminals appearing in specific places.\n\nThe string the user provided starts with 't91 t69 t69 t80 t80 t28', etc. Let me list all the 't' parts for clarity:\n\nt91, t69, t69, t80, t80, t28, t91, t49, t29, t18, t26, t74, t74, t94, t74, t18, t42, t28, t21, t50, t21, t94, t97, t74, t82, t23, t49, t82, t59, t1, t47, t94, t26, t94, t21, t74, t97, t69, t69, t69, t18, t94, t59, t92.\n\nEach of these is a terminal derived directly from a production. So the derivation must proceed in a way that these terminals appear in these positions.\n\nFirst, I think about the start symbol S which produces NT23 NT24, or others. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo when you expand S, you get a pair of non-terminals. Each of those needs to expand, and eventually, we should get the terminals in the string.\n\nBut another approach is to look at the possible sequences of terminals that each production can generate. For example, some NTs have direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, for instance:\n- NT23 \u2192 't50'\n- NT1 \u2192 't62'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' (wait, no, NT21 \u2192 't21'? Wait, no: NT21 \u2192 't21', is that correct? Or is it another production? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, some of these seem like NTx \u2192 'tyy', perhaps. Let me parse that.\n\nWait, for example:\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT23 \u2192 't50' (from production NT23 \u2192 't50')\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' (this seems a bit unclear, as it's written as NT21 \u2192 't21', which is a terminal, perhaps? Or maybe a typo.)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't49'\nNT23 \u2192 't50'\nNT2 \u2192 't47'\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nSo, any production that ends with 't' is a terminal? Or maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps I can proceed assuming that when an NT rule ends with 't' followed by numbers, that's the terminal.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I might need to look for each NT production. For example, NT23\u2192 't50': so NT23 is a production that expands into 't50', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT9 \u2192 't78', etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, whenever a t... appears, it's a terminal that the non-terminal must expand into.\n\nSo perhaps I can model the derivation by looking at the string and seeing if it can be broken down into the possible NT productions.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the problem is about whether the string is generated by the grammar, perhaps I can think about it in terms of whether the string can be generated by applying the productions, considering that each rule can be used any number of times, and in any order.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parsing problem. But since this is a small string, let me try to see if it can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree for the string would be a way to verify.\n\nBut given the time, maybe a better approach is to see if each of the 't's in the string can be produced by some NT production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, several NTs expand to terminals:\n\nFor example:\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80' (from the part: NT28 \u2192 't80')\n- NT23 \u2192 't50'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\nWait, but NT27 is also in the middle of a production, e.g., NT27 \u2192 't69' in another production.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The grammar has various productions:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT23 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80'\n\nWait, but in production rules for NT23, it's written as NT23 \u2192 't50' \u2014 that's a production where NT23 directly expands into the terminal 't50'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't49' is a terminal, as well as NT28 \u2192 't80', etc.\n\nSo each of the terminals in the string must match one of these NT productions.\n\nLooking at the given string:\n\nt91, t69, t69, t80, t80, t28, t91, t49, t29, t18, t26, t74, t74, t94, t74, t18, t42, t28, t21, t50, t21, t94, t97, t74, t82, t23, t49, t82, t59, t1, t47, t94, t26, t94, t21, t74, t97, t69, t69, t69, t18, t94, t59, t92.\n\nLet me see if each segment of this string corresponds to a possible derived terminal.\n\nLooking for 't91' \u2014 is there an NT91? Wait, no. None of the NT productions in the grammar seem to have 't91' as a terminal. So that's a problem. Because 't91' is in the string but cannot be derived by any of the NT productions listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again for any NT productions that result in 't91'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't91'. The closest I see is NT29 \u2192 't29', but that's for a different t.\n\nSo, the first 't91' is in the string. But the grammar doesn't have an NT rule that directly produces 't91', so how"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-618","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, which generates NT24 NT5. So the entire string must ultimately derive from S.\n\nThe string given is: t42 t82 t47 t47 t94 t42 t82 t26 t21 t86 t97 t69 t23 t82 t92 t42 t78 t18 t59 t23 t97 t29 t74 t94 t86 t97 t69 t94 t59 t26 t1 t80 t29 t82 t62 t21 t62 t50 t23 t74 t59 t59 t1 t69.\n\nI notice that some symbols like 't42', 't82' etc., are terminal symbols, meaning they are actual terminal nodes in the parse tree. So I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly expand to terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't94', etc. So the strategy is to find how the given string can be built using these terminal symbols.\n\nLet me try to break down the string and see if it can be constructed using the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start from the beginning:\n\nt42: Where does t42 come from? Looking at the rules, NT24 -> t1, but t42 is a different terminal. Wait, checking the rules: I see NT24 -> NT5 NT19, and NT5 -> NT15 NT8, but some of these go deeper. Alternatively, maybe t42 is produced by NT2 or NT4.\n\nLooking more closely, I see NT24 -> 't1', but the string has t42. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the initial rules for S are S -> NT24 NT5, so the first two symbols should come from NT24 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT24, the production is NT24 -> NT5 NT19. Then NT5 is NT5 -> NT15 NT8.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t42. Let me check the grammar again for any non-terminals that produce t42.\n\nLooking through, I see NT5 -> 't26', not t42. Hmm. Maybe I need to see further steps.\n\nLet me perhaps build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S: S \u2192 NT24 NT5.\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8.\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50'.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nHmm, this path leads to 't50' and then NT1 and NT28. But in the string, the first symbol is t42, so this path might not be the right one.\n\nAlternative path: S \u2192 NT24 NT5.\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me look for the terminals in the string and see if they match any non-terminals' productions.\n\nt42 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT24 is a non-terminal that can produce 't1' via NT24 \u2192 t1, but t42 is not t1. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking again, I see NT24 -> 't1', but 't42' is not among the terminals. So how can 't42' appear in the string? Maybe I'm missing some rule where a non-terminal expands directly into 't42'. Scanning all the rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't42'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again for any NT that expands directly to a terminal with t42.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT24 -> t1, NT25 is not terminal, NT23 is not terminal, etc. So none of the non-terminals directly produce 't42', which is odd because the string includes it. That suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar, but I should make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals expand into multiple symbols, some of which are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t42 is a result of a non-terminal that I haven't considered. For example, maybe NT17 or another non-terminal can expand to t42.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NT with 't42' in their production. All the terminals listed are things like 't42', 't82', etc. So maybe the problem is that these terminals are allowed in the grammar, but the non-terminals can't generate them because they don't have a production for them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't42' is a non-terminal that I'm supposed to consider as a terminal. Wait, no, 't42' is written in italics, so I think it's a terminal symbol. So if the grammar doesn't have any production where, say, NT24 \u2192 t42, then t42 can't be generated, unless it's part of a larger production that includes it.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t42, which would require that the first production step produces t42, but looking at S's productions, both S \u2192 NT24 NT5 and S \u2192 NT20 NT16 etc., don't produce t42. NT24 is t1, so the first symbol in the string can't be t42 unless NT24 can somehow produce it.\n\nWait, no, let me correct myself: the first production from S is either NT24 NT5 or other options. So if S \u2192 NT24 NT5, then the first two symbols come from NT24 and NT5. NT24 is t1 (from NT24 \u2192 t1). So the first symbol in the string is t42, which should come from NT24 or NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check the NT24 rule again.\n\nLooking back, in the initial S rule, S \u2192 NT24 NT5, so the first part is NT24, which is t1, but in the string, the first is t42. That can't be right because t42 isn't t1. So this suggests that the string cannot be generated because the first symbol doesn't match any production starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the production rules for NT24. Maybe NT24 can expand into t42 after more steps.\n\nWait, the rule for NT24 is NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19. Then NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8, and NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28. NT15 \u2192 't50', NT28 \u2192 't20'. Hmm, that's leading to 't50' and then 't20', which doesn't give t42.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another chain for NT24. Let me check other rules involving NT24.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, and then I don't see any other NT24 productions. So perhaps t42 isn't generated by NT24. But the string starts with t42, so unless there's another production for S, this can't be.\n\nLooking back, S can also produce other things, like S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So perhaps the string starts with a different production. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, the first symbol is t42, which must come from either NT24 or NT5 because S's first rule is NT24 NT5. NT24 is t1, so t42 can't be from there. So unless there's another way, the string cannot start with t42. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe the string is not in the right form at all because the first symbol is t42, which can't be produced from any of S's initial productions. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a production. Let me scan through the rules again for any NT that may expand to t42.\n\nLooking through all rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t42. Hence, the string cannot start with t42 because none of the initial non-terminals produce it.

{"custom_id":"request-623","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume are tokens. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is between two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nFirst, I'm looking at the initial productions of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and from S, it can generate NT24 and NT5, or several other combinations like NT20 and NT16, etc. Each of these NTs seems to be non-terminals that can further produce other NTs or eventually lead to terminals, perhaps ending with 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't1', 't49', etc. My initial thought is to see how these 't's are being generated. For example, 't1' could be produced by an NT that eventually leads to 't1' through productions. I check the grammar and see that NT24 can produce 't1'. Similarly, NT28 can produce 't80'. \n\nI realize that to handle this, I might need to parse the string using the grammar. However, since the string is quite long, manually checking each step isn't feasible. So I'll look for patterns or possible derivations that could lead to the entire string.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several productions where non-terminals are broken down into other non-terminals. For example, NT23 can produce NT6 and NT9. If I can find a sequence of these productions that eventually breaks down into the given terminals, then the string is generated.\n\nBut I also have to make sure that each step correctly follows the grammar's productions. Each NT must produce another NT or a terminal. For instance, NT13 isn't in the productions, so that's a red flag. Wait, but looking at the grammar, does it include all necessary NTs to break down into 't's? I check the list and see that some NTs lead to 'tX' like NT9 -> 't91' and NT24 -> 't1'. \n\nAnother approach is to see if each token in the string can be generated by the grammar. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. 't1' must come from some NT. Looking at the grammar, NT24 -> 't1', so that's possible.\n\n2. Then 't49' would need to find a NT that produces it. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT5 -> 't26', but wait, the string has 't49', which isn't directly mentioned. Wait, maybe NT5 can produce something that leads to 't49'? Or perhaps there's a typo. Wait, looking again, NT24 -> 't1', but 't49' could be from NT23 perhaps? Wait, no, NT23 is 't42'. Hmm, maybe I need to track it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should identify which 't's correspond to which NTs. Alternatively, maybe I can track a parse tree.\n\nWait, the string is \"t1 t49 t47 t94 t91 t21 t50 t42 t1 t28 t59 t42 t23 t42 t69 t86 t29 t62 t50 t69 t47 t23 t29 t91 t26 t80 t69 t21 t29 t94 t23 t23 t91 t18 t91 t18 t78 t80 t23 t47 t94 t97 t23 t42 t29\". That's 44 tokens.\n\nI might try to see if each 't' can have their corresponding NT in the grammar. Let's pick one at random: 't49'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT30 -> 't29' and NT23 -> 't42', so 't49' is perhaps not directly generated. Wait, maybe NT15 is 't50' but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some NTs produce terminal strings longer than one symbol. For example, NT27 produces two 't's, but in the string, I don't see multiple 't's in a row. Wait, looking back, the string has 't97', 't62', etc., but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should count how many times each 't' appears and see if they link back to the grammar. For example, the first 't1' can come from NT24 as per NT24->'t1'.\n\nThe next is 't49'. Looking through, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't49'. Maybe it's a production that leads through several steps. For example, NT23 can produce NT6 and NT9. If NT6 produces 't6' and NT9 produces 't91', then 't6' 't91' would be in the string. But in the given string, we have 't49' which is not matching.\n\nWait, maybe 't49' is from NT29? Let me check. NT29 can produce NT7 and NT8. NT7 is 't24', and NT8 is 't91'. So 't24' 't91' would be part of the string, which isn't the case here. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT49 isn't part of the grammar, but maybe it's generated via something else. Wait, the grammar's productions don't include NT49, so 't49' doesn't seem to be directly or indirectly produced by the grammar. That would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check the grammar. I'm looking for any NT that can produce a 't49'. The grammar doesn't list any productions for NT49, it's just a terminal in the string. So unless there's an NT that eventually leads to 't49', which I don't see, then 't49' isn't part of the language.\n\nTherefore, since the string contains 't49' and the grammar doesn't include a production for it, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce t29?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT23 -> 't74' via NT15, but perhaps more directly, checking the rules:\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT2 -> 't62'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT11 -> 't18'\n- ... and more.\n\nSo NT12 and NT30 both produce t29. Let me see which one is possible.\n\nLooking further, the string starts with t29 t28. So after t29, we have t28.\n\nLooking for t29 followed by t28. So for the first part, let's think:\n\nIf the first part is NT12 -> t29, then what's before? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT12 can produce NT26 NT9.

So perhaps NT30 (t29) is produced, and then NT10 (t28) is produced.\n\nLooking at NT10's productions: NT10 can be produced by NT14 NT27, NT19 NT12, or NT27 NT8, or other rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT10 has:\n\n- NT10 -> NT14 NT27\n- NT10 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT10 -> NT19 NT12\n- NT10 -> NT11 NT10\n\nHmm, so it's a bit complex. Let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT12 -> t29, followed by NT26 NT9.\n\nSo after t29, next is t28, which could be produced by NT26 -> t23 or NT26 -> t69 or maybe NT26 can split into other non-terminals. But in the string, the second symbol is t28, so that would require NT26 to produce t28, but looking at the productions, NT26 can only produce 't23', 't69', or split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT28's productions are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT18\n- NT28 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT28 -> NT24 NT23\n- NT28 -> NT10 NT22\n\nSo none produce t28 directly. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with t29, then t28, but if NT28 doesn't produce t28 directly, that's an issue. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check again.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it restricts each production to the form A -> BC or A -> a, making parsing somewhat straightforward, though still not trivial.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal (like S, NT23, etc.) expands into two non-terminals or a terminal (t or a number, but wait, looking closer, those are actually 't' followed by numbers? Or is 't' a terminal? Hmm, actually, in the given grammar, I see that several productions end with 't' followed by a number, like 't49', 't50', etc. So, in this case, the terminals are these 'tXX' strings. The rest are non-terminals which produce other non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which aligns with the terminals in the grammar. Each production has exactly two parts, either non-terminals or these 't...'. The string has to be composed such that each terminal appears in the correct order as per some sequence of productions.\n\nGiven the string: `t86 t97 t86 t74 t74 t29 t91 t18 t74 t29 t21 t94 t42 t82 t47 t1 t92 t47 t78 t21 t29 t28 t86 t29 t49 t50 t80 t26 t47 t50 t42 t21 t29 t1 t23 t92 t21 t18 t59 t59 t86 t69 t74 t74 t21 t78`\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by some number, which represents a terminal in the grammar. The task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can consider trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since each production only expands into two symbols, the string's length can give us some clues. The length here is 63 terminals, which is quite long, but given the grammar's structure, it might be possible.\n\nLet me start by looking at the beginning of the string. The first token is 't86'. I need to see which production generates 't86'. Looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT8, but leads to t80?\nWait, actually, looking back at the grammar rules, I need to check all productions that result in terminals. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, most productions are from non-terminals to other non-terminals. The only terminals are specific to certain productions, like NT23 -> NT27 NT16, but that's producing another non-terminal. Wait, no, the productions are:\n\nLooking again, the grammar includes rules like NT7 -> NT24 NT6, etc. But also, several rules produce 't...'. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT74 -> 't86'?\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a mapping of which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me compile a list:\n\nTerminals in the grammar are 't49', 't50', 't80', etc. Each occurs as a production:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT23 -> 't74'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT29 -> 't29'\n- NT30 -> 't29', 't23', 't86'\n- NT24 -> 't1', 't42'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69', 't23', 't42', 't94'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT1 -> 't62'\n- NT27 -> 't49'\n- NT0 -> 't25', 't27', 't28', 't50', etc.\n- NT5 -> 't10', 't17'?\nWait, maybe I should list all the 't..' as their own terminals and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example, 't86' is produced by NT30 as per NT30 -> NT10 NT8, wait no, looking through the grammar, NT30 has several productions, such as NT30 -> NT3 NT1, which leads to more non-terminals, but also NT30 -> NT9 NT7, which leads to 't78' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead look for which non-terminals produce 't86', 't97', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT1. No terminal here.\n- NT20 -> several options, including NT17 NT8. NT8 is a non-terminal.\n- NT18 -> NT23 NT27, which are non-terminals leading to 't74' and others.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me think again. It's clear that some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT2 -> 't47', so whenever a production of NT2 is used, you get 't47'. Similarly, NT8 -> 't91'.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe production NT2 -> 't47' indicates that whenever NT2 is on the left side of a production, it can be replaced by the terminal 't47'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals may produce terminals:\n\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT21 -> 't21' (assuming 't21' is a terminal)\nWait, no, the string has 't50' which is from NT15 -> 't50', so whenever NT15 is used, you get 't50'. Similarly, NT26 -> 't23' among others, but also NT26 -> 't42', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to build a parse tree. Let's try to start from the beginning of the string and see if we can apply the productions in reverse.\n\nThe string starts with 't86 t97 t86 t74 t74 t29 t91...'.\n\nSo the first token is 't86'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't86'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT30 -> 't86'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT30 has some rules, but none of them directly produce 't86'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT30 has a production to 't80', but that's under NT30 -> NT3 NT1. Hmm, no. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check all rules for 't86':\n\nLooking through the grammar, the 't86' appears as a terminal in NT30's production: NT30 -> NT3 NT1, NT3 NT1 leading to 't86'? Or maybe from other non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-631","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the string we need to evaluate: \n\n`t78 t29 t59 t94 t78 t29 t80 t1 t21 t18 t78 t1 t97 t28 t47 t91 t23 t42 t18 t1 t92 t28 t94 t21 t47 t49 t91 t80 t92 t80 t21 t91 t42 t26 t1 t91 t42 t62 t23 t92 t21 t29 t78 t50 t69 t82`.\n\nThis string is a sequence of tokens, which in the context of the grammar seem to correspond to terminals. Each token like 't78', 't29', etc., is either a terminal or derived from the productions.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar and the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production (except for terminals) has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and I see that S is defined in terms of S \u2192 NT23 NT5 and others. But wait, looking closer, all S productions have two non-terminals, except maybe some. Actually, checking the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT5\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nThese are all S \u2192 NT X, which is two non-terminals. So S is a start symbol that produces two non-terminals each time.\n\nNow, the goal is to see if this string can be derived from S through a series of replacements using the given productions.\n\nThe string starts with t78, which is a terminal. So the first step would be to find which non-terminal can produce 't78' as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I can scan through the productions to find any right-hand side that contains 't78' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\n- NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24\n- NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2\n- NT16 \u2192 NT59\nWait, looking carefully at the end of the productions, I spot:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\nNT30 \u2192 't80'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, NT16 can produce 't59', which appears in the string as t59. That's a possible step.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't78' in the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\nBut wait, let me check each production for terminals:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26: No terminal.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25: No.\n- NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25: No.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11: No.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8: No.\nWait, looking again at the end of the user\u2019s grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions from NT2 through NT30, and the end ones:\n\nAt the end of the productions:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\nNT26 \u2192 't23' (Wait, let me check all productions)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals. Let's scan all the productions:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar, the productions that have terminals (ending with 't') are:\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT23 \u2192 't42'\n- NT29 \u2192 't80'\n- NT30 \u2192 't80'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91' (Wait, checking line by line)\nWait, the productions:\n\nLooking at the entire list of productions (simplified for brevity):\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26 (So NT26 can produce NT8, which might go to 't8' or not. Alternatively, NT8 might go to 't91'... Let me check.)\n\nWait, better approach: go through the productions one by one and note which NTs produce terminals.\n\nLet me list them:\n\n1.

For example:\n\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\nNT23 \u2192 't42'\nNT29 \u2192 't80'\nNT30 \u2192 't80'\nNT21 \u2192 't21' (Wait, no, the user's grammar shows 't21' as a production, but let me check:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, one of the productions is:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21' (since in the end, the user lists 't21' as a string, but the grammar shows:\n\nLooking at the user's grammar, is there any NT that produces a terminal? Let me check the end:\n\nLooking for any production where right-hand side is only a terminal:\n\nYes, the user included several productions ending with 't' followed by another token? Or just 't'?\n\nWait, looking at the very bottom of the user's grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions are in the format S -> NT1 NT2, etc. Then, for example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't23': No, actually, the user's grammar has some where the RHS is a terminal followed by non-terminal? Wait no, the user wrote:\n\nFor example, near the end:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't42' (I think the user might have a typo, but in the grammar as written, it's NT23 \u2192 NT42. But 't42' is a terminal.)\n\nWait, looking carefully at the user's grammar, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't42' (I think that's a typo, but actually, the user's list includes:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't42' (from the last line: 'NT23 -> NT24 NT29' is another, but also:\n\nLooking at: \n\nThe user's grammar includes:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't42'\nNT15 \u2192 't74'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\nOther productions where the right side is just a terminal, perhaps.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the productions on the right-hand side have terminals, while others are non-terminals.

Since the grammar has a set of production rules, I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, another approach might be to construct a parse tree and see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me see the initial grammar rules again. The start symbol is S, and looking at the productions for S:\n\nS -> NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can produce combinations of these non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals further expand into other symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t80. Let's see if there's a production that leads to t80.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice some that end in t80 or similar terminals. Let me search for any NT that can produce t80.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT80 is actually t80? Wait, no, the rules have lines like NT80 -> t80? No, let me go through the rules carefully. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see NT80 is written as 't80', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT70, NT69, etc., are terminals.\n\nSo NT24 -> t42, and other rules. Wait, let me scan the rules to see if any NT leads to t80. From the rule list, I don't see an NT that directly produces t80. Hmm, but wait, maybe through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t80 is derived from a combination of non-terminals. Let's see what t80 is derived from. Is there a production that includes t80? Or perhaps t80 is a terminal, so it's produced directly by an NT that can derive it.\n\nWait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT28, and some others.\n\nWait, maybe starting from S, can the first part of the string be parsed?\n\nLet me consider the first token in the string: t80. So let's see if any of the non-terminals can produce t80.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I don't see any direct production for t80. Let's verify the rules:\n\nCheck if any NT \u2192 t80.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT80 isn't listed directly. Wait, no, the rules have t80 as the result of some productions. For example, NT28 \u2192 t80 NT18? No, NT28 in one rule is t20 NT18, another rule is NT28 \u2192 NT24 NT9. Wait, maybe I should look for any NT that can produce t80 as the first step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t80 is part of a production chain.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, for NT28, one production is NT28 \u2192 NT24 NT9, another NT28 \u2192 t80 NT18. Ah, so NT28 can produce t80. So if the string starts with t80, it can be produced by NT28.\n\nSo the first token t80 comes from NT28. Then, the next tokens are t80, t50, t62, etc.\n\nSo in this case, the first part would be S \u2192 NT28 NT28? Or perhaps another rule. Wait, looking back, S has several options, but t80 is not directly in S's productions. So probably, S must first produce a combination of non-terminals that include t80.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to go deeper.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. Let's model the parsing as a series of reductions. We need to see if the entire string can be represented as a series of productions from S.\n\nThe string is long, so maybe it's better to look for patterns or known endpoints.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t80. From the grammar, the only NT that can produce t80 is NT28, since one of its rules is NT28 \u2192 t80 NT18.\n\nSo the first step is to have NT28, followed by NT18.\n\nBut NT18: Let's see its productions. From the rules, looking for NT18, I don't see an NT18 in the list, but checking rules, perhaps.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT18 doesn't seem to be directly a target of any production. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, in the given rules, I see NT18 is produced by two rules: one is NT18 \u2192 NT19 NT25, another is NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT8.\n\nSo NT18 can go to NT19 NT25 or NT17 NT8.\n\nSo, the first two symbols are t80 followed by t80. Wait, no, the string is t80 t80 t50 t62... Wait, no, the first symbol is t80, the second is t80, but in reality, in the grammar, after the first NT28 (which is t80), the next would be NT18. So the second token after t80 must come from NT18.\n\nBut in the string provided, the second symbol is t80 again, which would mean NT18 must produce t80, but from earlier, I saw that NT18 can't directly produce t80. Wait, did I get that right?\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules again, I think I made a mistake. Let's check NT28's rules:\n\nLooking back, I saw:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT20 NT18\"\n\nSo NT28 can produce NT20 and NT18. Also, another rule says:\n\n\"NT28 -> t80 NT18\"\n\nSo NT28 can produce t80 followed by NT18.\n\nSo the first token t80 is from NT28, giving us NT28, and then the next token comes from the other side of NT28's production, which is NT18.\n\nSo after NT28, the next symbols are produced by NT18.\n\nBut in the string, after t80 comes another t80. So the second token would have to come from NT18.\n\nBut looking at NT18's rules, none of them directly produce t80. Because NT18 splits into two NTs, not a t80.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the second t80 comes from another NT28. So, the first two tokens would be t80 and t80, which could imply that after the first NT28 (t80), the next part comes from another NT28.\n\nBut looking at the first production rule, S can have NT28 NT28? Let me check S's rules again.\n\nLooking at S's rules, none of them include NT28 except for S -> NT20 NT16, etc. So unless S can produce NT28 NT28, which it doesn't directly, the initial part of the string can't have two t80s unless there's a way for S to produce NT28 twice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Maybe I misread the rules. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the first rule for S is S \u2192 NT24 NT24. Then S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So S doesn't directly produce NT28, unless through some other non-terminal. So maybe the string's starting with two t80s can't come from S,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-646","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to check if each of these tokens can be derived through the grammar's production rules.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the production rules to get a sense of what the grammar can do. The CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing because we can use algorithms like the CYK algorithm to check membership.\n\nBut instead of parsing the entire string, maybe I can look for patterns or use a different approach. Let's see:\n\nThe start symbol is S, and from S, I can go to various other symbols. Let me see the productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 (token 't42')\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16 (tokens 't92' and 't59')\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3 (t89 and t26?)\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6 (t92 and t16)\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5 (t89 and t26?)\n\nWait, the terminals here are 't's with numbers, which might be specific to the grammar. Now, looking at the string: it starts with t62, t42, t21, etc.\n\nFrom S, the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which becomes t42 in the string. So that's a match. Then, after that, looking at the string, the next terms are t21, t21, t92, etc. Wait, t21 is a production for NT21, which has the rule NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24. And looking at the grammar rules, I see NT28 has a production to 't23', which is t86? Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, NT28 has the production NT28 \u2192 NT97 NT47 or NT23 NT97? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking up NT28: I see NT28 \u2192 NT26 NT9? Wait, let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar seems extensive with many rules. It might be easier to map this out step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the string as a sequence of steps through the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which can produce various NT combinations. The string starts with t62, which corresponds to NT2 \u2192 t62, as per the rules: NT2 \u2192 t62. So the first symbol is generated by NT2.\n\nNext symbol is t42. NT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24. Wait, looking at the rules, NT21 has a production \u2192 t21, which is 't21', but in the string, it's t42. Wait no, let me check.\n\nWait, the string is: t62 t42 t21 t21 t92 t49 t82 t26 t97 t23 t86 t47 t80 t1 t42 t74 t97 t47 t18 t97 t62 t94 t29 t29 t1 t49 t59 t80 t1 t94 t94 t86 t62 t74 t29 t94 t26 t26 t94 t59 t21 t97 t1 t47 t94 t1 t62.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should map out the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with t62, which comes from NT2 \u2192 t62 (from NT2's production rules).\n\nSo the first token is produced by NT2.\n\nThen the next token is t42. Looking for where t42 comes from. Checking the grammar, NT2 has t62, but NT4 has t42 as per NT4 \u2192 t42 (from the productions, yes: NT4 \u2192 t42).\n\nLooking at the grammar rules under NT2 and NT4:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t62\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n\nSo t62 (from NT2) followed by t42 (from NT4). So the sequence would be NT2 \u2192 t62 and NT4 \u2192 t42.\n\nWait, but in the CFG, each production can only generate a pair of non-terminals, but in the string, t62 and t42 are individual terminals. So each must be generated directly by a one-symbol production.\n\nWait, that's not right because in CNF, each production is for a non-terminal, which can expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a string of terminals, each non-terminal in the expansion must eventually produce a terminal.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals. So I need to see if each symbol in the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that certain sequences can only be generated in a specific way, so I need to see if the given string can be constructed by combining these rules.\n\nLooking at the string: starts with 't62', 't42', then 't21', 't21', etc.\n\nFrom earlier, 't62' comes from NT2 \u2192 t62.\n\nThen after NT2, the next symbol is 't42' which comes from NT4 \u2192 t42. So perhaps the CFG can generate 't62 t42' as a substring if S can produce NT2 NT4 or something like that.\n\nWait, looking at S's productions, none of them directly produce 't62 t42' as a pair. So maybe I need to see if there's a way for S to produce a chain of these symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is a series of productions applied in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the later parts of the string will give a clue.\n\nAt the end of the string, there's t62 appearing multiple times, which would correspond to NT2 \u2192 t62.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT2: from the grammar, under NT2 we have:\n\nLooking back, the production rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t62\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT27\n- NT23 \u2192 NT19 NT9 (t42: NT23 can be t42)\nWait, maybe not. Let me find all the rules that produce t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t62\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT11 \u2192 t19 (Not sure if it's t19 or a different code)\nWait, I think I need a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire process step by step.\n\nGiven the string:\n\nt62, t42, t21, t21, t92, t49, t82, t26, t97, t23, t86, t47, t80, t1, t42, t74, t97, t47, t18, t97, t62, t94, t29, t29, t1, t49, t59, t80, t1, t94, t94, t86, t62, t74, t29, t94, t26, t26, t94, t59, t21, t97, t1, t47, t94, t1, t62.\n\nEach symbol represents a production where the non-terminal is split into two or a terminal.\n\nStarting with S, we can see that S can produce various combinations. Let's try to parse the string by starting at the beginning:\n\n1. t62: must come from NT2 \u2192 t62.\n\nSo after S, we have produced NT2, which becomes t62. Now, following this, the next symbol is t42, which must come from NT4 \u2192 t42. Wait, but how does NT2 get to NT4? Or maybe there's a chain of productions: Maybe S produces NT2 and NT4, but looking back at the productions of S:\n\nS can produce NT23 NT24, which when expanded, may lead to t62 and t42.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and I can see each token is a string ending with a number, like 't49' or 't50'. \n\nFirst, I should remind myself that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The initial productions from S are various combinations of NTs, which are the non-terminals. Each of these leads to other non-terminals until terminals are reached, which in this case are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe provided string is quite long: it has 40 tokens. I need to parse this string according to the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent or Pratt parsing, but given the structure of the problem, I'll try to approach it step by step.\n\nI should start by looking for the top-level productions of S and see how the string can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the initial productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24\nS \u2192 NT20 NT16\nS \u2192 NT17 NT3\nS \u2192 NT20 NT6\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo, S splits into two NTs. Each of these NTs will lead to other NTs until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me inspect the first token in the string: 't94'. Looking through the grammar rules, I need to see which production leads to 't94'. Scanning through the NT productions, I notice that several NTs terminate with 't' followed by a number. \n\nFor example:\n- NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25 (if that leads to more NTs)\nBut looking deeper, I find:\n\nWait, actually, some NTs directly produce 't's:\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT23 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69', etc.\n- Also, NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT17 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't94'. So, I need to find a production for a non-terminal that leads to 't94'. From the list, NT2 \u2192 't94' is a direct production. So, the first part of the string could be from NT2.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, NT2 can be:\nNT2 \u2192 NT25 NT19\n\nSo, after 't94' we need two tokens: 't25' and 't19'. But wait, the next token is 't29', not 't25'. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with a different NT leading to 't94'. Or perhaps the first NT is different.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps the first part of the string is more than one NT. Let's check the initial productions from S again.\n\nFor example, S can be NT23 and NT24. Let's see what those can produce.\n\nLooking at NT23 and NT24:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 NT25 NT19 \u2192 which I've seen before.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't94', which is NT2, not NT23.\n\nWait, maybe the first NT is a different one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S is producing NT23 and NT24, and then each NT eventually produces 't's. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should consider breaking down the entire string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all the 't' tokens can be traced back to the start symbol S via the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst token is 't94', which must come from NT2. So, S \u2192 NT2 ... ?\n\nWait, looking at the initial productions again: S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. None of these directly involve NT2. Wait, hold on. NT2 might be a derived symbol, not a direct choice from S. Because S doesn't produce NT2 directly, based on the initial productions, S seems to produce combinations of other NTs.\n\nLet me double-check. Looking at the initial productions from S, I see S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So, S splits into two NTs. Each of these NTs can further split into more NTs.\n\nGiven that, the first token 't94' must come from one of these NT splits. Let me check:\n\nLooking at each production from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24: So, NT23 and NT24 must both produce sequences that eventually result in 't94' as the first token. But NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT5 \u2192 't26', which starts with 't26', not 't94'. Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't94', but NT23 is followed by NT24, so that might not fit.\n\n2. S \u2192 NT20 NT16: NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0, and NT16 doesn't directly produce 't94'. NT20 produces 't97' eventually, so the string starts with 't94' might not fit.\n\n3. S \u2192 NT17 NT3: NT17 \u2192 NT23 NT2, and NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25. So the first token would be 't94' again, but in this case, NT3 goes to 't9' (from NT9 \u2192 't91' or NT3 \u2192 't78'). Not matching.\n\n4. S \u2192 NT20 NT6: NT20 \u2192 't97', which doesn't start with 't94'.\n\n5. S \u2192 NT9 NT5: NT9 \u2192 't78', which doesn't start with 't94'.\n\nSo, none of these initial productions of S lead directly to 't94' as the first token. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the initial S can produce through some chain that leads to 't94' as the first token. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe the first NT is NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0, and NT28 \u2192 NT4 NT23, etc. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9. NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and NT2 \u2192 't94'. So, if S splits into NT28 and NT0, and NT28 eventually produces 't94' as part of its chain, that could be possible.\n\nWait, let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't94' 't29' 't29' etc.\n\nAssuming S produces NT28 and NT0, let's see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nSo the sequence would involve 't94' coming from NT2.\n\nBut looking at the string, after 't94', the next tokens are 't29', 't29', then 't82', 't18', etc.\n\nBut in this case, the first 't94' would be the first token, then the next NTs would follow.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nI can try to identify the order of the tokens and see if they can be grouped into sequences that correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother thought: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a combination of two non-terminals. So, each 't' must be generated by a chain of productions leading to 't's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into units where each unit corresponds to a production. For example, each production leads to a certain sequence of 't's.\n\nBut this string is quite long, so that might not be feasible manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a tree where each node is a production, and the leaves are the 't's. That tree structure could be checked against the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity, another approach is to see if the first few tokens can match any of the initial productions.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: 't94' and 't29'.\n\nLooking for a production that results in 't94' followed by 't29'.\n\nLooking at NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-651","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and looking at both the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form. I remember that means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I see various non-terminals like S, NT23, NT30, etc., and the terminals like 't47', 't86', and so on. Each production is a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals except a few that end with a terminal like 't47' or 't50'.\n\nThe string to evaluate starts with 't47', ends with 't50' and includes several other terminals in between. So I guess I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by examining the productions that can produce the starting terminal 't47'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't47' (multiple times)\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- Others like NT20 -> 't97' and so on, but 't47' occurs in two places under NT2.\n\nSo the string starts with 't47', which suggests that the first symbol in the derived string comes from NT2. Since NT2 is replaced by 't47', it must be generated via the production NT2 \u2192 't47'. Therefore, the first production used is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, but wait, S isn't directly producing a terminal; S is an uppercase letter. Wait, the grammar starts with S, and S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which doesn't directly produce a terminal. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misapplied. Let me check again. The productions under NT2 include NT2 \u2192 't47' and NT2 also has productions to other non-terminals. So for the string starting with 't47', the first symbol is 't47', which can only come from NT2 \u2192 't47'. So the first step must be S \u2192 NT23 NT24 (but that produces non-terminals), but that's the start rule. So perhaps S \u2192 NT23 NT24 would eventually derive to 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't47'. So the first production must be NT2 \u2192 't47'. Therefore, the parser would need a production that starts a non-terminal that can be replaced by 't47', which is NT2.\n\nSo the start symbol S must be expanded into non-terminals such that one of them is NT2, and the other non-terminals somehow produce the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for NT23 include NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 and other NT23's. But importantly, I see NT23 \u2192 't47' as well? Wait, looking back, no: The grammar provided under NT23 has several productions to other non-terminals, and some to terminals, like 't47' is under NT5, perhaps. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar. The user provided a long list of productions. Looking through them, I see lines like NT2 -> 't47' and NT22 -> 't28'. But in the section listed, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT23 there are several productions, including NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, etc., and finally, looking for any NT23 productions to terminals. Wait, I see:\n\nSomewhere, looking for 't47', I see NT2 \u2192 't47' appears multiple times.\n\nYes, NT2 \u2192 't47' occurs three times:\n\n- Line 5: NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- Line 12: NT2 \u2192 't47' (assuming the numbers are correct, but in the actual grammar, each production starts with the non-terminal and then the right-hand side)\nWait, looking back, the grammar in the question is written as, for example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nand so on.\n\nBut then in the middle, I see lines like:\n\nNT2 -> 't47'\nNT21-> 't49'\nand more.\n\nSo, the key point is that NT2 can produce 't47', and since the string starts with 't47', that suggests that the first symbol comes from NT2 \u2192 't47', so that production must be used at the start.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, which can only produce non-terminals. So S must expand to two non-terminals, say X and Y, such that X produces 'something' and Y produces the rest.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is 't47', so the first symbol must come from a production that produces 't47'. But S can't produce 't47' directly. So for 't47' to be the first symbol, the S must expand into something whose first symbol is a non-terminal that can then expand to 't47'.\n\nLet's think: S can go to NT23 NT24 or other options. But to get 't47' as the first symbol, one of those must produce 't47' as the first non-terminal, and then the rest follows.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\nNT23 \u2192 NT19 NT27\nNT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21\nNT23 \u2192 NT22 NT26\nNT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\nWait, no, the user's grammar includes NT23 \u2192 't47' (probably not), wait, actually looking at the user's grammar, I did not see a production for NT23 \u2192 't47'. Wait, let me check the given grammar more carefully.\n\nThe user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT30 -> NT3 NT1\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24\nNT7 -> NT23 NT2\n... and so on.\n\nLooking through all the NTxxx rules, I don't see a production where NT23 goes directly to a terminal. Instead, the only terminals are like t47, but I see no such NT rule for NT23. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT23, I can't find any production that leads to a terminal. So NT23 is only expanding into other non-terminals. Similarly, looking for where 't47' appears, the productions are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't47' occurs three times.\nNT5 \u2192 't26' occurs, but 't26' is a different terminal.\nNT22 \u2192 't28'? No, looking back, I think there might be NT22 \u2192 't28' as per line: NT22 \u2192 't28' (if line 12 says that), but let's check.\n\nLooking again through the grammar, here are the relevant lines:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't28' (multiple times)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47' (three times)\n- NT23 \u2192 't47' would be... Wait, looking for any NT23 \u2192 't47', I don't see it. Wait, the user's grammar in the list might include NT23 \u2192 't47' but I can't remember. Let me look carefully.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT2 -> 't47': yes, three times: lines 5, 12, and perhaps others.\n- NT22 -> 't28': yes.\n- NT24 -> 't1' etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see any NT23 \u2192 't47', so the initial production leading to 't47' would have to come from another NT. But according to the user, the string starts with 't47', so perhaps there's a production rule for another NT that can produce 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe one of the non-terminals can produce 't47' as a terminal symbol. Looking through the grammar, the only NTs that can produce terminals are those that have a rule to a terminal, like NT23 \u2192 't47'... Wait, in the given grammar, is there any NT that can produce 't47'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- S is a start symbol and only expands to other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for any NT that can directly produce 't47"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-668","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce various combinations of non-terminals NT followed by numbers. Each production seems to be of the form NT X -> NT Y NT Z, except for the first few which are S -> NT24 NT5, etc. Wait, no, actually looking closer, all productions except the initial ones are in the form NT A -> NT B NT C. So each non-terminal on the left produces exactly two non-terminals on the right. \n\nBut wait, the start symbol S is the top-level, and all productions from non-terminals like NT23, NT30, etc., produce terminal symbols or other non-terminals. Some of them produce terminal symbols directly, like NT2 -> 't47', and so on. So the grammar is a CFG where each non-terminal has exactly two productions, except for the terminals. \n\nThe string given is a series of terminals, all denoted by 't' followed by a number. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Each production in CNF is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But in our case, the initial productions for S are already two non-terminals, like S -> NT24 NT5. So each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, recursively building up until you reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is a linear sequence of these 't' symbols, I guess the derivation must involve combining non-terminals through these productions. Since each production results in exactly two symbols, the total number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the depth of the derivation. The string here counts the number of elements: let me count them. \n\nWait, the string is:\n\nt18 t92 t94 t59 t69 t42 t59 t1 t74 t59 t92 t74 t78 t78 t91 t62 t18 t1 t50 t59 t86 t94 t21 t23 t26 t26 t82 t29 t1 t91 t80 t62 t50 t82 t21 t23 t82 t69 t42 t86 t59 t86 t1 t21 t47 t26 t26 t50 t69\n\nThat's 49 terms. Wait, that's 49 symbols. But wait, 49 is not a power of 2, right? Because each application of a production doubles the number of symbols if both are non-terminals. Hmm, but maybe some of these symbols are terminals, so the count might not be strictly exponential. Wait, but in the grammar, the productions for NT may produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example, some NT rules produce a terminal like NT2 -> 't47'. \n\nSo, actually, the number of symbols in the string doesn't have to be a power of two. It depends on how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals versus non-terminals. But this complicates things because we can't directly compute it that way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this more constructively. Let me try to start from the string and work backward to see if it can be derived from S. This is a standard bottom-up approach in CFG analysis.\n\nStarting with the entire string and trying to split it into two parts that fit the productions of some non-terminal.\n\nBut let me see: the last symbol is t69. Looking at the grammar, NT26 can produce t69. Specifically, looking back:\n\nNT26: \n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26\n- NT26 -> NT4 NT29\n- NT26 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT26 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT26 -> NT6 NT29\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar includes:\nNT26 -> 't69', but wait, in the grammar, some of the NT rules do produce a single terminal. For example, NT26 -> 't69'. Similarly, NT12 -> 't29', NT2 -> 't94', etc.\n\nWait, let's find which non-terminals produce which terminals. Let me list them:\n\nNT23 -> 't42'\nNT16 -> 't59'\nNT9 -> 't78'\nNT7 -> 't82'\nNT26 -> 't69' (from NT26 -> 't69')\nNT15 -> 't74'\nNT24 -> 't1' (from NT24 -> 't1')\nNT21 -> 't21' (from NT21 -> 't21')\nNT22 -> 't28' (from NT22 -> 't28')\nNT20 -> 't97' (from NT20 -> 't97')\nNT23 -> 't86' (from NT23 -> 't86')\nNT30 -> 't29' (from NT30 -> 't29')\nNT15 -> 't74' (from NT15 -> 't74')\nNT24 -> 't1' (from NT24 -> 't1')\nNT16 -> 't59' (from NT16 -> 't59')\nNT9 -> 't78' (from NT9 -> 't78')\nNT2 -> 't94' (from NT2 -> 't94')\nNT5 -> 't26' (from NT5 -> 't26')\nNT7 -> 't86' (from NT7 -> 't86')\nNT28 -> 't80' (from NT28 -> 't80')\nNT4 -> 't2...' wait, looking back, there are several NT4 productions:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't26' \n\nYes, NT4 -> 't26'\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\nNT12 -> 't29'\nNT12 -> 't28' \n\nSo, to approach the string, I should look for the last terminal and see which non-terminal can produce it. Let's start:\n\nThe last symbol in the string is t62. Looking for NTs that can derive 't62'. Scanning the grammar, do any NTs produce t62? Checking:\n\nNT5 -> 't26' (yes, for example, NT5 -> t26)\nBut that's NT5, not t62.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any NT production that directly produces 't62'. Hmm, that's a problem. So, is there any production in the grammar that leads to 't62'? Or can 't62' be derived from non-terminals?\n\nWait, 't62' is produced by NT26 -> 't62' (Yes, looking back: NT26 is written as NT26 -> 't69' in some cases, but I think in the last lines, there is NT26 -> 't69'? Wait, no, let me double-check.\n\nWait, here's the part:\n\nAt the end, under NT26: \n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n\nWait, but where's 't62'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces 't62'. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again through the entire grammar rules to see if 't62' is produced. \n\nLooking at all the rules, I don't see any NT production that directly produces 't62'. For example, NT26 -> 't69', but no NT26 production gives 't62'. Similarly, other NT rules don't seem to produce 't62'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, under 'Other productions', I see at the very end:\n\nNT26 -> 't69'\nNT12 -> 't29'\nNT2 -> 't94'\nNT5 -> 't26'\n\nSo, no, 't62' is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the string ends with 't62', which is not a terminal that any NT in the grammar can produce. That suggests that the string cannot be derived from the grammar because the last symbol isn't present in the productions.\n\nWait, but maybe 't62' is produced through a chain of non-terminals. Let me double-check.\n\nFor example, suppose 't62' is the result of a sequence of productions. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't62'.

{"custom_id":"request-661","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string we need to evaluate: \n\nt91 t29 t26 t74 t59 t29 t97 t47 t78 t92 t97 t42 t23 t23 t86 t18 t91 t50 t42 t50 t59 t78 t23 t80 t91 t69 t74 t28 t42 t94 t91 t91 t62 t47 t86 t97 t42 t1 t97 t97 t94 t86 t29 t80 t74 t80 t82 t21 t91.\n\nI notice that most of these are 't' followed by numbers, which seem to be non-terminals (like t91, t29, etc.), except for a few lowercase 't's. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I recall that some non-terminals end with a letter t. For example, NT24 becomes 't1', NT20 becomes 't97', etc. So each of these t followed by numbers except some letters must correspond to a non-terminal.\n\nBut first, the grammar: I need to check if each 't' is a terminal or a non-terminal. The productions in the grammar end with terminals or have 't' at the end. For example, NT24 \u2192 t1, which is a terminal, so t1 is a terminal symbol. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 NT5 t49, but wait, in the grammar, NT23 has productions that go into other non-terminals, but it also has a production where it ends with 't49', meaning t49 is a terminal.\n\nSo, any string composed of these terminals must follow the derived rules. Now, the given string mostly consists of different 't' symbols with numbers. Let's see if these correspond to terminals.\n\nBut wait, let me think. The 't's in the string are like t91, t29, etc. They must correspond to the terminals defined in the grammar. Each terminal in the grammar is a t followed by numbers. So, for example, NT24 \u2192 t1, NT25 \u2192 t49, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the string, let's count the number of symbols. It's quite long, but I think the key is to see if the string can be derived step by step using the productions.\n\nBut with so many symbols, it's impractical to do this manually. Another approach is to note the starting symbol, which is S. The grammar rules start with S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, S \u2192 NT17 NT3, S \u2192 NT20 NT6, or S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, the string starts with t91, which is likely corresponding to a specific production.\n\nWait, let me figure out what each 't' is:\n\nt91: probably from NT1 -> t50? Wait, NT1 is defined as NT23 NT22. Let me check: NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27. And NT30 can be NT3 and NT10 if not further split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look at the grammar rules and list each terminal as per the production.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t1\n\nNT20 \u2192 t97\n\nNT15 \u2192 t50\n\nNT2 \u2192 t94\n\nNT5 \u2192 t26\n\nNT22 \u2192 t28\n\nNT26 \u2192 t69\n\nNT30 \u2192 t29\n\nNT12 \u2192 t29\n\nNT7 \u2192 t82\n\nNT26 \u2192 t23 (is that the same as t69?)\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT24 -> t1\n\nSo, when we see t1, it's the result of NT24.\n\nNT20 -> t97\n\nSo t97 is NT20.\n\nNT15 -> t50\n\nt50 is NT15.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t91, which isn't one of the immediate terminals listed. Hmm. That suggests that maybe t91 is a terminal from a longer production. For example, perhaps NT8 \u2192 t1 NT28, or something like that.\n\nWait, looking further:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28\n\nAnd NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n\nSo, NT8 would become t1 t97 and so on.\n\nBut in the string, it's just t91. So unless t91 is a direct terminal from a production.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for 't91' in the productions. I don't see any production that ends with 't91'. So perhaps 't91' is derived from NT8 \u2192 t91 NT22.\n\nWait, looking at NT8: in the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28.\n\nAnd looking up NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27.\n\nNT27: There's a production for NT27 \u2192 NT2 NT23.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the approach is to map each 't' in the string to a specific production, but with so many 't's, it's impractical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with t91, which must be NT8's production because in NT8 \u2192 t91 NT22, but wait, I don't see a production that produces t91 directly.\n\nWait, actually, let's check the NT8 rule. The grammar says:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28; and another production: NT8 \u2192 t18 NT19; Wait, is that correct? Looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT8 has the rules:\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar step by step. The grammar as provided is:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\n\n...\n\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\n\nNT28 -> NT20 NT18\n\nNT18 -> NT16 NT25\n\nNT21 -> NT28 NT24\n\nWait, I don't see any production that ends with 't91'. So perhaps t91 is not a terminal, but in the given string, it's a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the non-terminals and terminals. The grammar's productions produce terminals like t1, t26, etc., but the string has t91, which isn't listed. So that might mean the string is invalid because the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces t91.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. For example, is there a production that combines to make t91? Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any production that results in t91:\n\nLooking at NT26: It has several rules, including NT26 \u2192 NT22 NT7 (which is t28) and others, but I don't see t91.\n\nLooking at other non-terminals:\n\nWait, NT20 \u2192 t97\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT28 NT24, which then breaks down into more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t91 comes from a combination of NT8 and NT21?\n\nWait, looking deeper:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT1 NT28; and NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27; NT27 \u2192 NT2 NT23; NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25; etc. Maybe this chain produces a combination of terminals, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t91 is an error because there's no production for t91 in the grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider that each 't' in the string must correspond to a terminal that is directly produced by some production. If any 't' in the string isn't listed as a terminal, then it's invalid.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\nt1, t97, t50, t94, t26, t28, t82, t29 (twice), t69, t23, t80, t74, t78, t59, t42, t49 is t49, but maybe others.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t82\n\nNT26 \u2192 t69\n\nNT30 \u2192 t29\n\nNT20 \u2192 t97 (from NT20 \u2192 t97)\n\nSo t91 is not in the list. Therefore, if the string contains t91, t92, etc., which aren't terminals, it's invalid because the grammar doesn't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since it's CNF, the string should have length that's a power of 2, but the given string has 63 tokens. 64 is 2^6, so 63 isn't a power of 2, which immediately might suggest it's not generated. But maybe I'm wrong. Let me think more carefully.\n\nWait, no, wait. The given string is 63 tokens. Let me count: the string provided is t23 t26 t78 ... up to t59 t62, etc., and the length is 63. In a Chomsky Normal Form grammar, the length of the string must be 2^n. For example, if the start symbol is S, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So starting from S, the maximum length after each step is 2^n. So the possible lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. 63 isn't a power of two, so maybe the answer is No. But perhaps there are other possibilities. Wait, no, in CNF, the only way to have terminals is when a production generates a single terminal. So the number of terminals derived from S through the productions would have to follow a binary tree structure, leading to lengths that are one more than a power of two, but actually, in CNF, the length after k steps would be 2^k. So S can derive a string of length 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. So if you have a derivation that produces a terminal, that's one step, and the length is 1. If a non-terminal expands into two symbols, then each can go on to expand. So the maximum length would indeed be a power of two. So 63 isn't a power of two; 64 is 2^6, so 63 isn't possible.\n\nBut wait, could the grammar have S \u2192 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 't1'? Then the string length is 1. Or S \u2192 NT23 \u2192 't23', length 1. Or S \u2192 NT1 \u2192 NT2, which might produce a longer string, but still with possible lengths being powers of two.\n\nSo since 63 is not a power of two, and all the possible strings generated by the grammar would have lengths that are powers of two, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 63, which is not a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it makes parsing easier, but I'm not actually going to parse it here. Instead, I'll try to understand the structure and see how the string could be derived.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that most rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Some rules directly produce terminals (like 't23', 't49', etc.) but wait, actually in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. So if a rule ends with 't' followed by a number, that might indicate a terminal. But in the given grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which can't be right because in CNF each production should have two non-terminals. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. That's three non-terminals, which doesn't fit CNF, since each production should have exactly two. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Maybe the rules have more than two parts? No, the user specified the grammar is in CNF, so each production must have exactly two non-terminals. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the first line of the grammar: S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. Wait, that's three non-terminals. That can't be right because CNF requires each production to be two symbols. Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps I need to interpret it differently. Alternatively, perhaps each 'NT' is a non-terminal that can produce two terminals or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see some NT's producing terminals, like NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11, but then other productions like NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25. Wait, but in the end, I see NT23 is assigned to 't49' which is a terminal. So each NT can either be a non-terminal or a terminal. But in standard CNF, everything is a non-terminal except the terminals. So maybe in this grammar, some non-terminals derive into terminals in the rules, which is allowed as terminal productions, but then others derive into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in that case, the grammar has a mix where some productions are terminals, and others are non-terminals. Hmm, perhaps the non-terminals can produce either one terminal or two non-terminals. Is that allowed in CNF? Wait, no, CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So perhaps the initial part has S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the way the grammar was written. Let me look again:\n\nThe initial line says: S -> NT23 NT24 NT5. That would be three non-terminals, but that's not possible in CNF. Maybe the user intended to separate the grammar with line breaks, which is perhaps the case, as after S, the next line continues.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT23 NT24 NT5 and then proceeds with other rules. Let me think. It's possible that the user intended to write each production in separate lines, so maybe S is the first production, and the others follow. But the way it's presented, it seems that S has three non-terminals, which is not possible under CNF. Maybe it's a typo, and it's S-> NT23 NT5, but that's still two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT23 is a terminal (as in the grammar rules where NT23 is defined as 't49'). Wait, in the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, but also another production NT23 \u2192 't49'. So, maybe NT23 can produce either a terminal or a non-terminal, which complicates things.\n\nBut in any case, perhaps the best approach is to walk through the string and see if each step can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals like t23, t1, t28, etc. So the string is a series of such tokens. Let's see if they can be derived by the grammar, considering the production rules.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t23, t1, t28, t1, t80, etc. So perhaps the string is built up from the start symbol S, which produces combinations of non-terminals, eventually resolving to terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Each step would involve expanding a symbol into two others until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut without knowing the exact derivation, it's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the symbols and ensure they fit the structure.\n\nWait, the grammar in CNF will produce strings where each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So each production adds two non-terminals if they're terminals, but in reality, some will reduce to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a sequence of steps where each step splits into two parts until the terminals are reached.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I can find a pattern or see if any step is a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built up from certain terminals, like 't49', 't50', etc., which are defined as terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't49', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, and NT30 can lead to other non-terminals. So perhaps the string is built from the leaves of such productions.\n\nLet me try to map parts of the string:\n\nThe string starts with t23 t1 t28 t1 t80 t86 t21 t94 t74 t80 t59 t18 t78 t18 t50 t74 t28 t29 t42 t26 t26 t86 t26 t26 t26 t91 t92 t62 t42 t82 t92 t23 t49 t78 t94 t50 t18 t82 t49 t42 t42 t86 t26 t... \n\nLooking for t23, which in the grammar can either be a non-terminal producing NT5 NT25, or a terminal if it's defined. Wait, wait, I think I see a problem. The grammar has NT23 as a non-terminal that can produce either NT5 NT25 or 't49'. Similarly, other NTs may have terminal or non-terminal productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for each terminal in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar. It might be easier to see if all terminals in the string are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string:\n\nt23: Yes, it's a terminal in the grammar (NT23 \u2192 't49') but wait, in the grammar, NT23 has two productions: one to NT5 NT25 and another to 't49'. So t23 as a terminal is only 't49', I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, wait, perhaps in the grammar, NT23 is a non-terminal that can produce either nt5 and nt25 or the terminal t49. So 't23' in the string is actually 't49', which is derived by expanding NT23 to 't49'.\n\nSimilarly, t1 is not directly in the grammar's terminals, but perhaps from NT1, which perhaps leads to 't1'. Let me check the grammar rules for NT1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 NT19 NT2, etc., but no NT1 directly maps to 't1'. Wait, perhaps 't1' is from another rule. Wait, in the string, I see 't1' appearing multiple times. Let me check if any NT can derive to 't1'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25,\nNT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22,\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4,\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8,\nNT21 \u2192 NT5 NT14,\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19,\nNT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2,\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT19,\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26,\nNT10 \u2192 NT14 NT22,\nNT12 \u2192 NT18 NT28,\n...\n\nWait, perhaps 't1' comes from a production rule. If so, let me check if any NT in the grammar can produce t1.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT24 is defined as NT5 NT19, which leads to NT5 (which can go to 't26' perhaps, but not t1. Alternatively, does any production have 't1' as a terminal? I don't see any. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t1 is a terminal derived from another production. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, looking at the string, it's two terminals: t97 and t59, separated by a space. So maybe the string is \"t97 t59\".\n\nI need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S. Let's see the productions from S. The first few are S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So S always splits into two non-terminals. Let's take one production, say S \u2192 NT23 NT5.\n\nSo, to generate \"t97 t59\", we need NT23 to derive t97 and NT5 to derive t59, or vice versa. Let's look at the NT23 and NT5 productions.\n\nLooking at NT23: It has productions like \u2192 NT5 NT25, \u2192 NT6 NT9, etc. Let's see if NT23 can produce t97.

Hmm, but the terminals are t97, t59. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the bottom of the grammar: I see that several non-terminals like NT15, NT2, etc., produce 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, NT15 produces 't50', NT2 is 't47', etc. So t59 might be from NT which eventually produces that.\n\nLooking at the top-down approach, starting from S, we can only split into two non-terminals.

Hmm. Let's look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps S can split into other non-terminals. Let's see S \u2192 NT20 NT16. Oh, wait, looking at the initial productions:\n\nThe fourth production is S \u2192 NT20 NT16.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT20 NT16.\n\nSo if S expands to NT20 and NT16, then each can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT20, does it have a production that can result in a terminal? Wait, in the earlier part of the grammar, I see that NT20 has a terminal, like -> 't97'.\n\nWait, looking at the very bottom of the grammar:\n\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\n\nYes, so NT20 \u2192 t97.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT16. The initial part of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nSo, NT16 \u2192 't59'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, then NT20 \u2192 t97 and NT16 \u2192 t59. So the string t97 t59 would be produced by this.\n\nWait, but does S have a production that splits into NT20 and NT16? Looking at the initial top, yes:\n\nS \u2192 NT16 NT25? No, let's check the first few:\n\nLooking back, the first few productions from S are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT5,\n\nS -> NT20 NT16,\n\nSo, yes, S can go to NT20 NT16. So that production exists.\n\nTherefore, the start symbol S can derive t97 t59 by choosing S \u2192 NT20 NT16, then NT20 \u2192 t97 and NT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nThus, the string is in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t1 t26\" and the grammar is a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several non-terminals (like S, NT23, etc.) and some terminals like 't1', 't26'. The start symbol is S, so I need to see if S can derive \"t1 t26\".\n\nLet me start by identifying the productions that directly produce terminals. It looks like S can't directly go to a terminal, but it branches into other non-terminals. So, S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc.\n\nThe string is \"t1 t26\", which has two terminals. Since the grammar uses two symbols, S \u2192 BC would produce two terminals if B and C can each produce one. Alternatively, it could be a production with three symbols if one of them produces multiple, but in this case, each production seems to go to two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that \"t1\" appears as an terminal. Checking the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 t1. So, if I can derive t1, that's one part. The other part is t26. Looking through the productions, NT23 \u2192 t26? Let me check the list.\n\nYes, under NT23, there's a production to 't23' and also NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT9 and others. So, looking through the grammar, I see that some NT23 are terminal. Wait, no. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT23, it's listed several times. Let me find if any of them produce t26. Scanning through, I see NT23 \u2192 t26 (no, wait, looking again, maybe I misread. Let me search through all the productions.\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 appears with productions like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1, etc., but looking specifically for terminals, I don't see a direct 't26' from NT23. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Wait, wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list: NT17 \u2192 t16 is not relevant. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me scan each rule for NT23 to see if it produces t26. Scrolling through:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16\n- NT23 \u2192 NT16 NT16\n- NT23 \u2192 NT28 NT23\n- NT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21\n- NT23 \u2192 NT21 NT27\n- NT23 \u2192 NT19 NT29\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT20\n- NT23 \u2192 NT4 NT23\n- All others don't produce terminals from NT23. So, it seems NT23 doesn't directly produce t26. Hmm, that's a problem because the string we're trying to derive is t1 t26.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me see if any other non-terminal can produce t26. Let me check NT26. Are there any productions where NT26 \u2192 t26? Or does it produce another non-terminal that can lead to t26.\n\nLooking at NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\nNT26 \u2192 NT4 NT29\nNT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26 and NT26 \u2192 NT4 NT29, but also NT26 \u2192 NT2 NT19, and others, but none directly produce 't26'. Wait, did I miss a production where NT26 leads to a terminal?\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT19 and NT26 \u2192 NT4 NT29, but no direct 't26'. So, NT26 can't directly produce 't26' as a terminal. So perhaps 't26' is generated by a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice that some NTs go to terminals. For example, NT24 \u2192 't1', NT5 \u2192 't26'! Yes, in the grammar, I see: NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n\nSo, perhaps the string \"t1 t26\" can be derived by S \u2192 something that leads to NT24 NT5, which then becomes t1 and t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has a production: S \u2192 NT15 NT5. But NT15 is another non-terminal. Let me see if NT15 can lead to 't24'.\n\nWait, no, NT15 has several productions, but perhaps through another path. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT16, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string is two terminals: \"t1 t26\". So, in the grammar, this would have to come from a production where two non-terminals each produce a terminal, connected as BC, where B \u2192 t1 and C \u2192 t26, or vice versa.\n\nLooking for where a production leads B \u2192 t1 and C \u2192 t26, or C \u2192 t1 and B \u2192 t26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t1, so B = NT24. Now, is there a production where a non-terminal C leads to t26? Yes, because NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n\nSo, if we have a production S \u2192 NT24 NT5, then S would derive 't1 t26' if NT24 \u2192 t1 and NT5 \u2192 t26.\n\nSo, let me check if the grammar has a production S \u2192 NT24 NT5. Yes, looking at the list, I see S \u2192 NT24 NT5 is indeed present.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT24 NT5. Now, NT24 \u2192 t1, which is one part of the string. But wait, what about the other part? NT24 is one of the non-terminals, so the other non-terminal here is NT5.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT24 NT5. So, S \u2192 NT24 NT5. So, to get 't1 t26', NT24 must produce 't1' and NT5 must produce 't26'. But wait, NT24 is a non-terminal that can produce 't1'. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nYes, NT24 \u2192 't1' is a direct production. So, S \u2192 NT24 NT5 would lead to 't1' followed by whatever NT5 produces.\n\nBut in the string we have, after 't1' comes 't26', so does NT5 produce 't26'? Yes, directly. So, S \u2192 NT24 NT5, and both NT24 and NT5 produce 't1' and 't26' respectively. Therefore, the string 't1 t26' is directly derived from S in one step.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each production in Chomsky Normal Form produces exactly two non-terminals. So, S \u2192 NT24 NT5 is a single production, and then each of those would have to derive to a terminal. So, the entire string would be 't1 t26' in one step, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, no, in one step, S produces NT24 and NT5, which each would then have to be terminals. But NT24 is a terminal (since it's 't1'), and NT5 is also a terminal ('t26'). So, yes, in one step, S directly produces 't1 t26' because both NT24 and NT5 are terminals.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t1 t26\" is indeed generated by the grammar, as S can directly produce it in one step via the production S \u2192 NT24 NT5, with NT24 \u2192 't1' and NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n<\/think>\n\nYes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is structured with a few non-terminals that can expand to terminals like 't' followed by numbers. Each production rule in the grammar shows how non-terminals like S, NT23, NT30, etc., can be broken down into other non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each rule is either a single terminal, a production to two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the given string `t78 t50 t91`, I notice it's a sequence of three two-character strings: `t78`, `t50`, `t91`. My job is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the possible productions from S are:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 NT21\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar more carefully, each rule in the context-free grammar is actually a production rule that says S can produce pairs of non-terminals, like S -> NT23 NT24 NT21, but that seems off because normally in CNF, each production is a binary split. Wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nOh, wait a minute, each production seems to be a pair, but actually, looking closer, the grammar entries are not in the standard form. For example, S -> NT23 NT24 NT21 is written as `S -> NT23 NT24 NT21` which would imply that S can expand into three non-terminals, which isn't allowed in Chomsky normal form where each production must have exactly two symbols: one non-terminal and one terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. Oh, I think I misread. Looking at the production rules again, for example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT21\n\nBut actually, each production in the CNF should have two symbols. So perhaps each rule is a pair of non-terminals, which then need to expand into terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I see rules where S appears on the left, but then has multiple non-terminals. For instance, S -> NT23 NT24 NT21 is written as `S -> NT23 NT24 NT21` which would actually be a production where S expands into three non-terminals, but that's incorrect for Chomsky normal form, which only allows two symbols. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but the user provided it in this way, so maybe each production is a triple? Or perhaps it's a typo and each production is a pair. I need to clarify this because it's crucial for determining the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended the productions to follow a certain structure, but due to formatting, they are written with multiple non-terminals. Let me see another rule: S -> NT23 NT24 NT23. That would be a production where S expands into three NT symbols, which again is not allowed in Chomsky normal form, as each production must have exactly one non-terminal on the left, and two symbols on the right: either a non-terminal and a terminal, or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the given grammar isn't in proper Chomsky normal form, but the user presented it that way.

For example, NT23 -> NT5 NT25 is a two-symbol production, which is allowed. Similarly, NT23 -> NT6 NT9, and so on.\n\nBut the start symbol S is written as producing three non-terminals: S -> NT23 NT24 NT21. That's a production with three non-terminals on the right-hand side, which violates Chomsky normal form because each production must have exactly two symbols. So this is a problem because it's not in CNF. Therefore, the grammar as given is incorrect. However, the user presented it as the grammar, so perhaps it's a typo or my misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the commas were meant to separate something else. But looking further, I see that other productions, like S -> NT20 NT16, which is two non-terminals, so that follows CNF. Similarly, S -> NT17 NT3 is two non-terminals. So it seems that S produces two non-terminals, but the other production S -> NT23 NT24 NT21 is problematic. That's three non-terminals, which is not allowed in CNF.\n\nThis suggests that the grammar is not correctly presented in Chomsky normal form. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, and the actual S productions are as per the rest. Alternatively, maybe the production S -> NT23 NT24 NT21 is a typo, and the correct production is S -> NT23 NT24, each on their own line. But that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended some other structure. But given the As is producing three non-terminals, that's invalid. So perhaps the problem is to consider the given grammar as is, regardless of whether it's in CNF, but the user says it's in Chomsky normal form. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading it. Let me check again. Each line under the grammar header is a production. For example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nS -> NT20 NT16\n\nS -> NT17 NT3\n\nS -> NT20 NT6\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, the first production is S -> NT23 NT24 NT5, which is three non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, okay, context-free grammars have rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand sides are combinations of terminals and non-terminals. The grammar provided seems a bit complex, but let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I notice that it's written with a lot of non-terminals (like S, NT23, NT30, etc.) and terminals (like t42, t74, t91) as the ending symbols. My task is to see if the string \"t42 t74 t91\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI remember that in a context-free grammar, the derivation starts from the start symbol and applies production rules until only terminals are left. Each step involves replacing non-terminals with strings of terminals and\/or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25 (I think, because \"NT\" is written as uppercase, so NT23 is a non-terminal. So S is broken down into three non-terminals: NT23, NT24, and NT25. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form allows productions to the left to be a single non-terminal, and the right side can be two terminals or two non-terminals. But in this case, the right side is written as \"NT23 NT24 NT25\", which seems like three parts, which might not fit Chomsky normal form. Wait, maybe it's a typo or perhaps I misread it. Let me check: the grammar starts with S -> NT23 NT24 NT25, right? Wait, no, looking back, the first few productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25? No, wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the first three are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25?\n\nNo, looking closely, the grammar is written with \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT25\" as the first option? Or perhaps multiple NT combinations. Wait, actually, the first line says \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT25\", but probably no, because in the user message it says \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT25\", but when I look again, the initial grammar lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, the first few are:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nGrammar:\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n...\n\nSo actually, each S production is actually written as a combination of terminals or non-terminals, but wait, I'm a bit confused because, in Chomsky normal form, each production should be on one side. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the format. In the provided grammar, each production is written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT25\n\nWait, but I think each production is written with a single non-terminal on the left and multiple symbols on the right. For example, S -> NT23 NT24 NT25 would mean S is replaced by NT23 NT24 NT25, which are a combination of three non-terminals? Or maybe S is replaced by a string of three non-terminals. But in standard CFG, each production is from a single non-terminal to either a terminal or two non-terminals. So having three non-terminals on the right would be okay because each can be considered as a separate production step, but the initial step would have to combine three non-terminals into a single terminal or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended it as S being replaced by two non-terminals because the production is written with a space, implying a concatenation. So for instance, S -> NT23 NT24 NT25 would be three non-terminals, but perhaps each can be processed separately, but that seems a bit more complex.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at each production and see how the right-hand sides are structured. Let me take each production and see:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT25: This would mean that S is replaced by three non-terminals, which themselves must be expanded.\n- S -> NT20 NT16: So S can be replaced by two non-terminals, which can then be expanded.\n- S -> NT17 NT3: Same here, two non-terminals.\n- S -> NT20 NT6: Two non-terminals.\n- S -> NT9 NT5: Two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first production for S expands into three non-terminals, while the others expand into two.\n\nThe string we're supposed to evaluate is \"t42 t74 t91\", which seems to consist of three terminals: t42, t74, and t91. So the string has three tokens.\n\nSince the string has three terminals, we'd need to see if they can be generated by a CFG that combines three terminal symbols in sequence.\n\nNow, let me see the right-hand side of the first production for S: NT23 NT24 NT25. So if we take S and replace it with NT23 NT24 NT25, then each of those non-terminals must expand into something that can produce the terminals t42, t74, t91 in the correct order.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if t42, t74, and t91 are produced directly by non-terminals or if they are only produced at deeper levels of the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules are in CNF, except I notice a few that might not be. For example, some rules have longer right-hand sides, like NT19 -> NT29 NT29, which seems okay, but I'll have to double-check.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t42 t91 t1 t91`. Since t's are terminals, I need to see how they can be generated by the grammar. Let's see where these t-terms can come from. Looking through the productions, I notice that some symbols like NT15, NT2, NT23, etc., are on the left side, and on the right side, sometimes I see terminals like 't47' or 't94', but none of the t42, t91, etc., except for a few, like NT7 \u2192 't82', NT22 \u2192 't28', and others.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first term is t42. Looking at the productions, where does t42 come from? Looking through the rules, I see that NT24 \u2192 't1', which is a terminal. Also, NT23 \u2192 't69' isn't helpful, but maybe other rules? Let me list all the productions that end with t terms:\n\nLooking at the productions, I spot:\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' (but not relevant here)\n- NT8 \u2192 't97' (I think maybe wrong)\nWait, no, more carefully:\nLooking through, I see rules like:\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82' (duplicate)\nWait, looking again:\n\nYes, here are the 't' productions:\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo in the string, we have t42, t91, t1, t91. Let me check if t42 is in the productions. Wait, none of the 't's in the rules have 't42'. Hmm, but looking at some other rules, like NT16 \u2192 't59', NT15 \u2192 't74', NT2 \u2192 't94', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me scan through each production rule again to make sure.\n\nLooking at NT24: NT24 \u2192 't1', so t1 is generated from NT24. But where is t42 generated? I don't see any rule that directly produces 't42'. But maybe indirectly through a combination. Let me check all the rules for 't':\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT28 \u2192 't80', 't49' (I think)\nWait, looking closely, some of the rules have t's:\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91' ? Let me check: looking for t91, is that from any NT rule?\n\nWait, going through each production, the terminals are:\n\nLooking at the string, t91 is the second term. I remember that NT8 \u2192 't91' (from the rules: NT8 \u2192 t91). So t91 is generated by NT8. That's good.\n\nNow, the first term is t42. Is t42 a terminal? Looking at the rules, I don't see any rule that produces t42. That's a problem because if the string has t42 in it, then somewhere the grammar must produce t42 as a terminal symbol. If it doesn't, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again. Do any of the non-terminals on the left produce t42? Looking through:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT23 \u2192 't69'\nNT7 \u2192 't82'\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\nNT8 \u2192 't91'\n\nNo, none of them produce t42. So if the string starts with t42, that suggests that somewhere in the derivation, t42 is produced, but since there's no rule that does that, it can't be generated. Therefore, the string `t42 t91 t1 t91` can't be produced by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe t42 comes from a combination of rules. For example, if a rule like S \u2192 NT24 NT24, then NT24 \u2192 t1, so that would produce t1 t1. But I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t42 is part of a larger non-terminal, but since the productions don't have t42, it's impossible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since it's a context-free grammar, each token must be derived from the start symbol S through a series of production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bunch of productions starting from S.

Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 produces t82 according to one of the grammar rules. Specifically, looking at NT7 -> NT22 NT27, and perhaps one of the other productions.

Wait, no, wait the NT20 rules are: NT20 -> NT28 NT0, etc. So some NT20 rules produce non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5. But looking at the grammar, it seems some rules might not follow the strict Chomsky normal form because I see some longer productions, like S \u2192 NT24 NT5. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, and the productions are all left-hand sides as a single non-terminal, right? Wait, no, actually, some of them are S \u2192 something, but others are NT... which are non-terminals. So I think that the grammar is in a slightly modified form, but not exactly standard CNF because S is the start and it's directly rewritten into two non-terminals.\n\nBut regardless, the main task is to see if the string can be derived from S. The string given is a sequence of terminals, each prefixed by 't'. So \"t80\" must correspond to some production of a non-terminal that eventually produces '80', and so on.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a few key points. First, the start symbol S has productions that go into NT24 NT5, NT20 NT16, etc. Since S starts the process, the string must ultimately come from one of these paths.\n\nThe string is t80 t47 t50 t91 t59. Let's list each terminal and see how they can be generated.\n\nStarting from S:\n\n1. The first step is to choose a production for S. Let's see which ones can lead to t80.\n\nLooking at the start productions:\n- S \u2192 NT24 NT5\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nWe need to see if any of these can eventually produce t80. Looking at the NT productions, let's try to find chains leading to the required t's.\n\nLooking at NT20: the productions are NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0, NT17 NT8, NT18 NT22, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for a path that can generate t80. From the grammar rules, I see NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0, and NT8 is one of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't91', which is a terminal. So if NT8 produces t91, then maybe somewhere down the line, we can get t80.\n\nLet me look for a way to get t80:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT5 \u2192 't26', and NT24 \u2192 't1'. Hmm, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, let me map each terminal in the string to possible non-terminals that produce them.\n\nt80: Looking for a non-terminal that produces 't80'. Checking the grammar rules, I see NT80 isn't present, but in the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' (from NT20 \u2192 't97')\n- NT12 \u2192 't29' (but that's t29, not t80)\n- Wait, looking more carefully, the right-hand sides have some terminals with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, let's make a list of where each 'tX' is produced.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT20 \u2192 't97', so if NT20 can produce 't97', but we need 't80', which isn't directly listed here.\nWait, but perhaps t80 is a typo or maybe it's a different non-terminal. Let me search each rule where a non-terminal leads to a 'tX' terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see several:\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82' (NT7 \u2192 't82')\n- NT8 \u2192 't91' (NT8 \u2192 't91')\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (NT5 \u2192 't26')\n- NT2 \u2192 't47' (NT2 \u2192 't47')\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' but that's a non-terminal?\nWait, no, NT21 is a non-terminal, but in some rules, it's a terminal. Wait no, looking back: I think I made a mistake. When I see a rule like NT21 \u2192 't21', does that mean 't21' is a terminal or a non-terminal? Wait, 't21' can't be a non-terminal because it starts with 't', which is a terminal symbol. Wait, maybe I've misread the rules. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules: some have 't' followed by a number, like 't82', 't91', etc. Those are terminals. So any non-terminal that has a rule with a terminal like 't80' must produce that.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT23 \u2192 't69' (since NT23 \u2192 't69')\nWait, no, actually, looking carefully, the rules have 't's followed by numbers, but I need to see if any non-terminal's production includes t80.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me look through all the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n- NT4 \u2192 't26' and 't22' etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' and 't91'?\n\nWait, actually, looking at NT7 \u2192 't82', NT8 \u2192 't91', NT5 \u2192 't26' when NT5 is in a certain production? Wait, no:\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The rules include:\n\nNT5 -> NT15 NT8\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT11\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\n\nBut then further down:\n\nNT8 -> 't91'\n\nNT20 -> 't97'\n\nSimilarly, others produce specific 't' strings. So perhaps 't80' is a terminal that's produced by a specific non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT20 \u2192 't97', but not 't80'. Similarly, other rules like NT17 \u2192 something, but not generating 't80'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each rule where a rule leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, each time a non-terminal leads to a terminal, it's via a rule such as NT20 \u2192 't97' or NT8 \u2192 't91'.\n\nBut I'm looking for t80. Does any non-terminal have a production that includes 't80'?\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94' (Wait, is that correct?)\n\nWait, I might be misinterpreting some rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking at the very beginning of the grammar, the start is S, and it has several productions.\n\nBut towards the end of the rules, I see:\n\nNT26 -> 't23' and others.\n\nWait, but when I scan through all the rules, the only 't' terminals I see are 't82', 't91', 't1', 't26', 't47', 't59', etc. I don't see a 't80' in any of the right-hand sides.\n\nWait, but in the string given, we have 't80', 't47', 't50', etc. So, does any non-terminal produce 't80'?\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, does any rule have a terminal as 't80'?\n\nWait, searching through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, but 't21' is another terminal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in parsing. Because 't21' is in the right-hand side.\n\nWait, actually, I think I missed that the rules include 't's like 't0', 't1', up to 't99', each as terminal symbols.\n\nBut specifically, 't80' is a terminal symbol in the given string, so I need to find a non-terminal that can directly produce 't80' or can be part of a derivation that leads to 't8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-69","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is \"t82 t92 t59 t47 t59\". Since it's a single string separated by spaces, I think each token represents a symbol in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The CNF grammar consists of productions where each production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) except for the start symbol which doesn't seem to be present directly. But in this case, the string starts with \"t82\", which suggests that the start symbol S might have been expanded into something that generates these terms.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I notice that some of the NT (Non-Terminals) eventually produce 't' followed by a number, like \"t82\", \"t92\", etc. This implies that these 't' symbols are terminal symbols. So, my task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual symbols: [t82, t92, t59, t47, t59].\n\nI need to check if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. Since it's CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. Terminals (like t82, t92) cannot be split further, so they must be the result of the entire expansion leading to a terminal.\n\nSo, the approach is to start from the symbol that produces S and see if we can derive \"t82 t92 t59 t47 t59\" through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it has several productions:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nThese are the initial productions. Since the string starts with t82, which is a terminal, I need to find which of these non-terminals produce t82 or t92, etc., or if the non-terminals are part of the productions leading to terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example, NT23->'t82' is a production. Similarly, NT16->'t59', NT5->'t26', and others. So, it seems that some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols, but most produce other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string \"t82 t92 t59 t47 t59\" is a sequence of terminals. For the grammar, each production should generate exactly two non-terminals unless it's a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step should split into two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, I can perform a backward approach:\n\n1. The last step of derivation would be a production that generates the last terminal. Let's look for productions that have a terminal as the second symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT16 -> 't59' (among others)\nNT23 -> 't82'\nNT5 -> 't26', 't23' (but 't23' is another terminal)\nWait, actually, some of these productions directly produce 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nSo, starting from the string and moving backward:\n\nThe last token is t59, which is the result of a production NT16 -> 't59'. Before that, the second-to-last token is t47.\n\nWait, no, the string is t82 t92 t59 t47 t59. So, working backward from the end:\n\nt59 is generated by NT16 (since NT16->'t59'). Before that, the penultimate symbol is t47. So, t47 must be generated by another production. Let me check what NT16's production is.\n\nWait, NT16 -> 't59', but I'm looking at the second last symbol. Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reconstruct the derivation steps.\n\nLet me consider the entire string and see if it can be built step by step.\n\nWait, but the string is five terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits the string into two parts. So to produce five terminals, the derivation must have split in such a way that we end up with five non-terminals reducing to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and applying productions.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the production S -> NT23 NT24.\n\nIf S produces NT23 and NT24, then each of these can further split.\n\nLooking at NT23->'t82', which is a terminal. So NT23 produces t82. Then NT24 is another symbol. Let's see what NT24 produces.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT24, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT1 (among others) and also NT5 NT19, etc. Wait, I need to check all productions for NT24.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT24 has several productions:\n\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- And others.\n\nWait, 't1' is another terminal. So if NT24 can produce 't1', then NT24 can be t1. Let me see.\n\nSo, if S-> NT23 NT24, then NT23->t82, and NT24->t1, then the result is t82 t1, which isn't our string. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another production for S. Let's try S -> NT20 NT16.\n\nNT20 can be 't97' or other things. Wait, looking at NT20's productions:\n\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- Others.\n\nIf S is NT20 and NT16, then NT20 could produce t97, and NT16 produces t59, giving t97 t59, which is not our string.\n\nWait, the string starts with t82. So S must produce a production where one of the non-terminals can produce t82. Looking at the S productions:\n\n- S-> NT23 NT24: NT23 can produce t82.\n- S-> NT20 NT16: NT16 can produce t59.\nBut not t82.\n- S-> NT17 NT3: NT17 produces things like 't30'? Not sure.\n- S-> NT20 NT6: NT20 produces t97, NT6 produces 't6' perhaps.\n- S-> NT9 NT5: NT9 produces 't78' or others.\n\nSo, only the first production of S (S-> NT23 NT24) can produce t82, given that NT23 can produce t82.\n\nTherefore, the first step is S-> NT23 NT24.\n\nNow, NT23 produces t82, so we need NT24 to produce the rest of the string, which is t92 t59 t47 t59.\n\nWait, but in the derivation, S->A B where A is NT23 (t82) and B is NT24. So the sequence after S would be t82 followed by what NT24 generates.\n\nBut the given string is t82 t92 t59 t47 t59. That's five tokens, so after S, we have five tokens. So, if S produces A B, then A produces t82, and B needs to produce the remaining four tokens: t92 t59 t47 t59.\n\nWait, but B is a single non-terminal, so it can't produce four symbols. That suggests that perhaps B itself is a non-terminal that can split further, each split producing two symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut the total number of terminals is five, which means the derivation must have split appropriately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that S->NT23 NT24. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S-> NT17 NT3. But that would produce 't30' and maybe something else, which doesn't fit. Or S-> NT20 NT16 produces 't97' and 't59', which also doesn't fit.\n\nSo, going back, S-> NT23 NT24.\n\nNow, NT23->t82. So the first token is t82.\n\nNow, the remaining tokens after t82 are t92 t59 t47 t59. These four tokens must be produced by the second non-terminal, which is NT24.\n\nSo, NT24 must produce t92 t59 t47 t59. But NT24 is a single non-terminal, so it must generate a sequence of symbols that collectively produce those four terms.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the steps I can take to check this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier since each production results in a single symbol (either a non-terminal or terminal).\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals derive into other non-terminals, and some into terminals, which are the 't' numbers here. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me write down the grammar to get a better overview:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5\nWait, no, the given grammar has multiple productions. Let me list all the S productions as per the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n... and more, but actually, looking at the initial part, S seems to have multiple productions, but I might need to check all possibilities. Wait, no. Wait, the grammar isn't complete here; the initial part shows S has multiple productions, but I think the full list can be inferred from the provided productions.\n\nBut to make it manageable, let me look at the 't's in the string and see which non-terminals derive into them.\n\nThe string is `t78 t97 t92 t59 t42 t91`.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal. So I need to find a derivation path that starts from S and ends with these terminals in order.\n\nI should first map each terminal to its possible non-terminals. Let me go through each 't' one by one.\n\nt78: Looking at the grammar, 't78' is produced by NT28 \u2192 NT10 NT22. Then, NT10 \u2192 NT9 NT27, and NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26, etc. But looking at the terminals, I might need to see if any non-terminal directly produces t78. From the grammar, looking at NT28, I see NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, and then NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, and so on. Wait, actually, the only way is via chain productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in reverse. For each 't', find which non-terminals can derive into it. For example, t78 is produced by NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, but also NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, etc., but looking for a direct production where the non-terminal is mapped to 't78'.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, 't78' is produced by NT28 \u2192 (looking at the production rules) wait no, the grammar only shows certain productions. Let's check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, the terminal 't78' is produced by which production? I see a line: NT23 \u2192 't49'. Another line says NT20 \u2192 't97'. Another line: NT12 \u2192 't29'. Another: NT26 \u2192 't12' is not, wait. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, here are some key points:\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 \u2192 't49'; but wait, in the rules I've been given, I don't see any NT producing 't78' directly. Hmm, but wait, perhaps 't78' is produced by some other non-terminal via a chain.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't49'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't12'\nWait, perhaps I'm not finding 't78' so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see how each 't' can be generated. Alternatively, maybe 't78' isn't directly produced, so I'll have to consider if it's possible via chain productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to create a mapping of each non-terminal to the terminals they can produce. For example, NT23 can produce 't49' directly. Other NTs can produce other terminals, but perhaps multiple steps are needed.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is `t78 t97 t92 t59 t42 t91`, perhaps each t is the result of a series of productions leading from the start symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the possible steps for each 't'. Let's take each 't' in the string and see how it can be generated.\n\nStarting with t78: Looking through the provided rules, I see that NT28 \u2192 (various options). For example, NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9. Then NT23 could produce other non-terminals, so perhaps t78 is not directly produced, but via some path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me look for any non-terminal that directly produces t78.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, there's no NT \u2192 t78 directly. So, perhaps t78 is derived through a chain of productions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t78 is produced by NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, and then NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, etc., until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, I might be overcomplicating. Maybe the way to approach this is to check if each 't' can be part of a valid string generated by the grammar. Let me try to see if each 't' appears in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, the 't's are:\n\n- t74 (NT15 \u2192 't50')\n- t49 (NT23 \u2192 't49')\n- t50 (NT15 \u2192 't50')\n- t26 (NT22 \u2192 't26')\n- t69 (NT30 \u2192 't69')\n- t82 (NT26 \u2192 't82')\n- t86 (NT30 \u2192 't86')\n- t30 (multiple NTs produce 't30')\n- t1 (NT24 \u2192 't1')\n- t62 (NT2 \u2192 't62')\n- t91 (NT28 \u2192 't91')\n- t92 (NT18 \u2192 't92')\n- t97 (NT20 \u2192 't97')\n\nWait, looking at the string, the last 't91' comes from NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, and NT20 \u2192 't97' and NT18 \u2192 't92'. Or wait, perhaps I need to track each step.\n\nWait, maybe starting from the start symbol S and trying to build the string step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string's structure aligns with any production rules.\n\nWait, looking at S, the grammar for S is given as S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5, and possibly other S productions. Wait, no, let me check the initial part. The user provided some initial lines of the grammar, perhaps just a few S productions. Wait, wait, the user's grammar starts with S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5, so the first four options, but perhaps there are others, but in the initial part, the S productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n2. S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n3. S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n4. S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n5. S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nWait, maybe other options are also present, but the user didn't list them all, perhaps because it's too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can only focus on the first few and assume others might exist, but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps to save time, I should look for a possible derivation of the string. Let me note that the string is six 't's, so the derivation must involve six steps, but since each production of S is a combination of two non-terminals (as S \u2192 NT...NT), perhaps the string requires multiple steps.\n\nWait, for example, each S production is S \u2192 NT...NT, meaning S can derive into two non-terminals. Then each of those can derive further.\n\nWait, considering that the string has six 't's, perhaps we need three steps of derivation, each producing two 't's, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe each 't' comes from a different part of the production tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' is part of a left or right sentential form.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to check each 't' in the string and see what can derive it. For example, t78: Looking through the grammar, does any rule produce t78? I don't see that. So perhaps t78 is part of a chain.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, the task is to determine if the given string `t74 t91 t62 t91 t42 t91` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand how CNF works. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar follows this structure, so that's a good start.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the provided string is a sequence of terminals. The string is `t74 t91 t62 t91 t42 t91`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived starting from S.\n\nI'll start by associating each token with a production or a terminal. But first, I notice that in the grammar, there are several rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is a combination of terminals and non-terminals. For example, NT23 -> NT5 NT25, but some have terminals, like NT3 -> 1 (if I remember correctly, but in the given grammar, NT3 is actually a terminal: see the last lines, NT3 is 't78').\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some symbols like NT3 are terminals because they map directly to 't78', 't62', etc. So, when I see a symbol that's a non-terminal, I need to expand it, but if it's a terminal, it's the end of that part.\n\nSo, let me start building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t74 t91 t62 t91 t42 t91\n\nSince the string starts with t74, I need to find a production that directly produces t74. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50' (a terminal)\nNT2 \u2192 't47' \nNT21 \u2192 't21'\nNT8 \u2192 't91'\nNT28 \u2192 't80'\nNT24 \u2192 't1'\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\nNT5 \u2192 't26' (terminal)\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT23 maps to 't69', 't86', etc. Wait, no: checking the grammar, I see lines like NT7 -> 't82', NT26 -> 't69', NT30 -> 't29', NT15 -> 't74', etc. No, wait: let me find which NT terminals.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT5 -> 't26' (since NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17, which eventually may produce a terminal, but perhaps NT5 can directly produce t26?)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals to see which map to which.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't82' (so t82 is a terminal)\nNT5 \u2192 't26' (t26 is a terminal)\nNT15 \u2192 't50' (t50 is terminal)\nNT2 \u2192 't47' (t47 terminal)\nNT21 \u2192 't21' (terminal)\nNT8 \u2192 't91' (t91 terminal)\nNT28 \u2192 't80' (t80 terminal)\nNT24 \u2192 't1' (t1 terminal)\nNT2 \u2192 't94' (t94 terminal)\nNT5 \u2192 't26' (t26)\nNT22 \u2192 't28' (t28)\nNT20 \u2192 't97' (t97)\nNT18 \u2192 't92' (t92)\nNT12 \u2192 't29' (t29)\nNT30 \u2192 't29' (t29)\nNT7 \u2192 't82' (t82)\nNT26 \u2192 't69' (t69)\nNT30 \u2192 't86' (t86)\nNT15 \u2192 't74' (t74)\nNT24 \u2192 't42' (t42)\nNT16 \u2192 't59' (t59)\nNT9 \u2192 't78' (t78)\nNT11 \u2192 't18' (t18)\nNT2 \u2192 't62' (t62)\n\nSo, the terminals available are t1, t4, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, t12, t15, t16, t17, t18, t19, t20, t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t29, t3, t42, t47, t50, t59, t62, t69, t74, t78, t80, t82, t86, t91, t92, t94, t97.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the tokens are t74, t91, t62, t91, t42, t91. All of these are terminals as per the above list. So each of these must appear directly as productions.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, each of these can directly occur as terminals, except perhaps for the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nWait, but in CNF, every production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if a symbol in the string is a terminal, it must be produced by a production rule that directly maps that non-terminal to the terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if the string starts with t74, then there must be a non-terminal NT that directly produces t74. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' (so t50 is directly produced by NT15)\n- Other terminals... Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where the RHS is a terminal:\n\nLooking at all the grammar rules, most have non-terminals, but some have terminals. For example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (so 't26' is a terminal that can be directly produced by NT5)\n- Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't82', NT8 \u2192 't91', NT15 \u2192 't50', NT2 \u2192 't47', etc.\n\nSo, for the string t74 t91 t62 t91 t42 t91, let's parse it step by step.\n\nI think the standard way is to parse left to right, finding non-terminals and replacing them with their terminals or non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me try to see the possible parse tree.\n\nFirst, the string is: t74 t91 t62 t91 t42 t91\n\nLooking for possible ways to break this down.\n\nLet's look for the first symbol, t74.

{"custom_id":"request-110","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t69 t78 t49 t59 t59 t18 t59` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it's structured in a way that's easier to analyze, typically involving productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals expand into more non-terminals, but some directly produce terminal symbols. For example, NT26 \u2192 't49' is a production that directly yields a terminal. Similarly, others like NT5 \u2192 't26', NT4 \u2192 't26', etc., all produce terminals.\n\nSo, my first step is to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be matched by the grammar.\n\nThe string breaks down into the following tokens: t69, t78, t49, t59, t59, t18, t59.\n\nI'll process each token one by one, tracking which parts of the grammar can produce them. Since the start symbol is S, I'll begin with S and see if I can derive the entire string.\n\nLooking at S, the productions are all of the form S \u2192 NTx NTy. Let's list them:\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n2. S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n3. S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n4. S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n5. S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nI'll need to see which of these can lead to the string. Let's start by considering each option.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24. So, the string starts with t69, which is 't49' for NT26, but 't69 isn't directly a terminal in the given NT26. Wait, looking back, I see NT26 \u2192 't49' (from the last section of the grammar). Hmm, maybe I need to check if any non-terminal expands into t69. Wait, looking at the productions, NT26 \u2192 't49', so perhaps t69 is not a direct terminal but maybe I misread. Wait, no, in the grammar's end productions, I only see NT26 \u2192 't49', so t69 is not present directly. So perhaps 't69' comes from NT23 \u2192 t69? Let me check if NT23 can produce t69.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT23 directly yields a terminal. So, I might need to see if NT23 can derive t69 through a series of productions. Let me check the productions for NT23. From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11\nNT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\nNT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\nNT29 \u2192 NT29 NT30\nNT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22\nNT10 \u2192 NT14 NT22\nNT14 \u2192 NT26 NT17\nNT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7\nNT12 \u2192 NT12 NT22\nNT12 \u2192 NT29 NT9\nWait, so NT23 derives into a chain that doesn't include t69. Unless I'm missing something, it seems like t69 isn't a terminal in this grammar. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe 't69' is a terminal. Let me check the terminal symbols. The string has t69, t78, etc. So, perhaps some non-terminal produces t69. Looking through the grammar, do any of the non-terminals directly produce 't69'? From the last part, I see NT26 \u2192 't49', NT23 \u2192 t69? Wait, let me look again. Oh, no: the last rules in the grammar include NT26 \u2192 't49', which would correspond to 't49', not 't69'. So, I think 't69' isn't present as a terminal in this grammar. That suggests that the string can't be generated because one of its tokens isn't in the terminals derived from the grammar.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any NT that produces 't69'? For example, does NT12 produce 't29' and then 't69' through further production? From the grammar, looking at NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT22. That's a recursive production, but it doesn't produce a terminal. So no, I don't think't69 is present. Alternatively, perhaps my initial analysis of the grammar was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me go through the grammar again more carefully. The terminal symbols seem to be in quotes, like 't49', 't59', etc. So each of these is a terminal. Now, for each token in the string, I need to check if it's present in the terminals of the grammar or if there's a non-terminal that can derive it.\n\nLooking at the string tokens: t69, t78, t49, t59, t59, t18, t59.\n\nNow, checking which terminals are present in the grammar:\n\nThey are 't49', 't59', 't18', and others. t78 is in the string, but checking the grammar, do any NTs produce 't78'?\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for 't78' as a terminal, I don't see it. The only terminals I see are 't49', 't59', 't18', and maybe others like 't26'. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT26 \u2192 't26', but in the last parts, I see NT17 \u2192 't50', but perhaps that's not relevant here. Wait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, that's 't49', not 't78'. So, 't78' isn't listed as a terminal in any production. That suggests that 't78' can't be generated by the grammar, which would imply that the string can't be generated. But that's contradictory because the string includes t78. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe 't78' is part of a longer derivation. Let me check. Looking at the grammar, perhaps one of the non-terminals can produce 't78' as part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, let me see: perhaps NT23 \u2192 t78. Or is t78 a terminal in some other non-terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I don't see any NT directly producing 't78'. The closest is NT23, which starts with NT5 and NT25, which further expand, but I don't see a t78 anywhere. So, maybe the string includes a token that the grammar can't produce, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in processing the grammar. Let me see if any NTs can produce the required terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: the start symbol S \u2192 NT23 NT24. S might derive NT23 NT24. Let's see what NT23 and NT24 can produce. If NT23 can produce t49, and NT24 can produce t1, perhaps that leads somewhere. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t69, which isn't among the terminals of NT23 or NT24.\n\nAlternatively, considering other S productions. For example, S \u2192 NT20 NT16. The string starts with t69, so maybe NT20 produces t69? But looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 't97' and NT16 \u2192 't59'. So that's not it.\n\nWait, the starting symbol S leads to two non-terminals. The first token is t69, so perhaps one of the S productions leads to a non-terminal that can produce t69.\n\nBut looking through, I don't see any NTs that produce t69 directly. So, that would mean the string can't be generated, right? But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps t69 is a result of a longer chain of productions. For example, maybe NT23 \u2192 t69 via some path. Let me check NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11 \u2192 NT30 (\u2192 NT9 NT7) and so on, but nowhere do I see t69.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Maybe t69 is part of a larger non-terminal's production. For instance, perhaps NT23 \u2192 t69 eventually, but from the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to check is `t80 t49 t74 t74 t78 t28 t59`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, some rules are like NT23 -> NT5 NT25, which are non-terminals, but some produce terminals, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Hmm, but in CNF, S \u2192 NT should be non-terminals, but S here is a terminal? Or maybe the grammar is not strictly in Chomsky Normal Form because some productions have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, the problem states it's in CNF, so all productions should be two non-terminals or a single terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules: For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24. NT23 is a non-terminal that produces NT5 NT25, which itself are non-terminals. But the string contains terminals like t80, t49, etc. So I think all these terminals are part of the grammar's terminals, not non-terminals. So each rule either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string given has the sequence t80, t49, t74, t74, t78, t28, t59. Since these are all terminals, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nI'll approach this by constructing the parse tree. Starting from S, I'll see which production rules can lead to the given terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the possible productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nI think I'll start with S \u2192 NT23 NT24 because that seems more complex. So let's see what NT23 and NT24 produce.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nSo S \u2192 NT23 NT24 becomes (NT5 NT25)(NT5 NT19) \u2192 t80 t49 t74 t74 t78 t28 t59? Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me map each of these non-terminals to their respective terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like certain NTs. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, but NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8, and so on until it might reach a terminal. I need to see how each NT can eventually produce a terminal or if they need to combine with other NTs.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, for the first symbol in the string, it's t80. Let's see which non-terminals produce t80. Looking through the production rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, etc. Hmm, I don't see a direct rule for NT producing t80. Wait, looking more carefully, I see that NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 NT91 (I think 't91' is the terminal here). Alternatively, looking elsewhere, I see that NT8 \u2192 NT9 NT19, but again, not directly pointing to t80.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for terminal symbols and map them. Let me list all the terminals present in the string: t80, t49, t74, t74, t78, t28, t59.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, but t49 isn't directly produced by any NT I see. Wait, perhaps t49 is from NT23, but looking back, I don't see any production that directly or indirectly leads to t49. Maybe NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25, and NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8, which then could produce t15 and t8, but t49 isn't in there. Hmm, perhaps t49 is produced by a different NT. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to find a path that leads to the entire string. For example, starting with S \u2192 NT23 NT24.\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nSo now S \u2192 (NT5 NT25)(NT5 NT19) \u2192 let's see what each of these produce.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11\n\nSo NT5 NT25 becomes (NT15 NT8)(NT30 NT11) \u2192 [NT15 NT8 NT30 NT11]\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8\nNT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\n\nSo NT5 NT19 becomes (NT15 NT8)(NT29 NT29) \u2192 [NT15 NT8 NT29 NT29]\n\nTherefore, S \u2192 [NT15 NT8 NT30 NT11 NT15 NT8 NT29 NT29]\n\nTrying to see if this can lead to the string. Let's check the terminals:\n\nWait, the string is t80 t49 t74 t74 t78 t28 t59.\n\nI'm not seeing t80 yet. Maybe I need to try another production for S.\n\nLet's try S \u2192 NT20 NT16.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo S \u2192 NT20 NT16 \u2192 (NT9 NT5)(NT16)\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT19 NT25. Wait, no, looking at the rules: NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11. Let me check. Hmm, perhaps NT25 is a non-terminal that also has a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Checking the rules: NT2 -> 't94', NT5 -> 't26', NT20 -> 't97', NT18 -> 't92', etc. No NT produces t59 directly. Wait, NT17 -> 't19' and NT19 -> 't6', 't19'\u2014but that's not t59. Hmm, maybe NT5 -> 't26' and others. Does any NT have a terminal production for t59? Looking through all rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t59 except maybe through some substitution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan all the production rules looking for 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nLooking at lines like:\n\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT11 -> 't18'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT6 -> 't17'\n- NT27 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't18'\n- NT28 -> 't20'\n- NT17 -> 't19'\n- NT14 -> 't27'\n- NT19 -> 't6', 't19'\n- NT23 -> 't49', etc.\n\nWait, I see that NT16 -> 't59'.

So unless I'm missing a production that produces t62, perhaps it's not in the language. But wait, looking again, is there any line that has 't62'? Let me check all lines:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't62'. So if t62 is a terminal in the string, then the string can't be generated because there's no NT that directly produces it.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm wrong because some productions might be creating t62 through intermediates.\n\nWait, the production NT0 -> NT27 NT11, which is a terminal if either of those is terminal. So if NT27 and NT11 produce some terminals, but in our string, I don't see any tX where X is 27 or 11.\n\nBut in our string, the terminals are t59, t78, t49, t59, t62, t18, t91, t59.\n\nSo, the fifth symbol is t62, which I don't see any NT production that directly gives t62.

{"custom_id":"request-131","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is `t80 t28 t91 t50 t49 t18 t62 t59`, and the grammar is a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar given seems to fit this because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string consists of terminals, and I need to see if there's a way to derive this string from the start symbol S by following the production rules. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use the CYK algorithm, but maybe it's easier to try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t80, then t28, t91, t50, t49, t18, t62, t59. I notice that some of these terminals are associated with non-terminals in the grammar, like t80 is from NT20's rule: NT20 \u2192 NT8 NT22. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT20 is one of the non-terminals with a production rule. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT20: S -> NT20 NT16, and there are several rules for NT20, like S->NT20 NT16, S->NT17 NT3, etc., but specifically, NT20 has a rule NT20 \u2192 NT8 NT22.\n\nWait, no, looking deeper, NT20's rules are S->NT20 NT16, and other rules like S->NT20 NT6, etc. So the direct production for NT20 is in S's rules, but non-terminals like NT20 can also be on the left side of other production rules. Wait, looking at the production rules for NT20: I see NT20 \u2192 NT8 NT22. So NT20 can be broken down into NT8 and NT22.\n\nSimilarly, looking at t80: the production rules for NT20 include NT20 \u2192 NT8 NT22, and also others like S->NT20 NT16, but I think NT20 itself can be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see how each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal. Let me start from the beginning.\n\n1. The string is t80 t28 t91 t50 t49 t18 t62 t59. So each token is a terminal. I need to see how these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- t50 is produced by NT15 \u2192 NT23 NT27.

The CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar and see what the start symbol is. It looks like the start symbol is S, and the productions for S are all starting with S \u2192 NT23 NT5, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. Each production splits S into two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of tokens ending with several t's, like t59, t29, etc. So I think the 't's are terminals, so each of these must correspond to some production rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and trying to parse it step by step. The string is: t59, t29, t18, t21, t28, t28, t23, t59, t59.\n\nI need to reverse-engineer how this string could have been generated by the grammar. Since all productions are two symbols, it's a binary tree structure, so the string's length must be 2^n - 1 for some n. The string has 9 tokens, which is 2^4 - 1 = 15? Wait, 9 is not a power of two minus one. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows more flexible structures, but I think it's still a context-free grammar with rules of two non-terminals each time.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string backward or look for possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, there are two t59s. Let me see if any production ends with t59. In the given grammar, looking for productions that have t59 as a terminal, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t1 (so NT24 becomes t1)\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT21 \u2192 t21\n- NT18 \u2192 t92 (not t59)\n- NT20 \u2192 t97\n- NT16 \u2192 t59\n- NT9 \u2192 t78\n- NT2 \u2192 t94\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT7 \u2192 t82 (not t59)\n- Other productions either don't end with t59 or have t59 as a result of other rules.\n\nWait, NT16 \u2192 t59. So if the last step of the derivation could produce NT16 \u2192 t59, and since t59 is the last token, that would be a possibility. Let's then consider that the last two symbols must be NT16, which produces t59, followed by another t59. But wait, the string ends with t59, t59, so that would require a production where something leads to t59, t59.\n\nWait, maybe that's not possible because each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except the base cases which produce terminals. So the two t59s at the end would have to be part of a production where the non-terminals derive into these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the last production is NT16 \u2192 t59, and before that, we have another production where a non-terminal generates t59 and t59? Hmm, no, because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get two t59s in a row, there must be a rule where a non-terminal A produces B and C, and both B and C derive into t59. But in this case, the only rule that produces t59 is NT16 \u2192 t59, which is a terminal production. So if a non-terminal A produces NT16 and something else, but wait, that something else would have to produce a terminal. Or, if we have a rule A \u2192 B C, where B is NT16 and C is another non-terminal, but that C would have to produce a terminal which is also t59. But in the given grammar, only NT16 produces t59.\n\nSo maybe the only way is that both B and C produce t59. That would require A \u2192 NT16 NT16, and both NT16s produce t59. So in that case, the derivation could have something like A \u2192 NT16 NT16, each NT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nLooking at the string, the last two symbols are t59, t59. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nYes, NT16 \u2192 t59 is a production, so if A \u2192 NT16 NT16, then A can derive t59 t59. So the two t59s at the end could come from a rule A \u2192 NT16 NT16, which is a production in the grammar.\n\nNow, the string ends with t59, t59, so before that, we have t23, t59, t59. So perhaps the production for NT23? Wait, no. Let's step back.\n\nWait, the entire string is: t59, t29, t18, t21, t28, t28, t23, t59, t59.\n\nSo in reverse, if the last two are t59, t59, that corresponds to NT16 \u2192 t59, and another NT16 \u2192 t59.\n\nBefore that, I have t23, t59, t59. Maybe the t23 and t59 are part of a larger rule. Let's look for a production where the non-terminals can produce t23 and t59.\n\nLooking for production rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can produce t23 (i.e., a production where something \u2192 t23) or t59.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the only way to produce a terminal is if the rule is a single terminal. So t23 is only a terminal in the grammar, right? Wait, no, because in the grammar, some rules are like NT23 \u2192 t59, but other non-terminals produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT16 \u2192 t59, which is a terminal. Similarly, NT22 \u2192 t28, NT18 \u2192 t92, etc. So t23 is not a terminal, but a non-terminal. So, t23 must be the result of a non-terminal derivation.\n\nSo in the string, I have a t23 followed by t59, t59. That would mean that the non-terminal corresponding to t23 (which is NT23) must derive into t23, then the next symbol is t59, but wait, t59 is a terminal, so perhaps NT23 has a production that is NT16 and NT59? Hmm, no, because NT59 doesn't exist; the terminals are things like t59, t29, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at NT23's productions. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\nNT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\nWait, no, I think I missed that earlier.

Hmm, okay, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can generate various languages, and the process of determining if a string is in the language involves checking if the grammar can derive that string through a series of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal symbol. That might make parsing easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol, and it has several productions:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT5\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, the string starts with S, which can split into two non-terminals. But the string starts with t26, which is a terminal. I think I need to backtrack and see how each terminal in the string could have been generated by the grammar.\n\nEach of the terminals in the string corresponds to a production where a non-terminal directly produces that terminal. For example, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21' (but that's just 't21', but the string has 't26' first)\n- NT8 -> 't91' (nope, not needed here)\n- NT28 -> 't80' (nope)\n- NT24 -> 't1' (nope)\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26' (Ah, here's the first match)\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92' (this is the fourth symbol)\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59' (this is the last symbol)\n- NT9 -> 't78' (this is the third symbol)\n- And so on for other non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't26', which is produced by NT5. So, the initial production must be S -> NT9 NT5 because NT9 is 't78' and NT5 is 't26'. Let's check: the string starts with t26 (NT5) and ends with t59. Wait, the last symbol is t59, which is from NT16. So S's productions must lead to a chain that includes NT16 and NT5.\n\nLet me outline the string: t26 (NT5), t62 (I need to check what this is), t78 (NT9), t49 (NT23), t59 (NT16), t49 (NT23), t1 (NT24), t92 (NT18), t59 (NT16). \n\nWait, the second symbol is t62. I don't see NT22 -> 't69', which is 't62' is not in the productions as a terminal except for NT22 -> 't28' (which is 28, but 62 is different). Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, in the given grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- Other non-terminals produce other non-terminals, as per their productions.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't26' which is NT5. So, looking for S's production that includes NT5:\n\nThe first production of S is S->NT23 NT5. So, perhaps the derivation starts with S -> NT23 NT5.\n\nNow, NT5 is 't26' \u2014 that's the first symbol. Then, we need to see how NT23 can produce the rest of the string starting from the second symbol, which is 't62'. But I don't have a production for NT23 that leads directly to 't62'.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar for NT23. Look through the productions:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25 (but that doesn't produce a terminal)\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT9 (again, non-terminals)\n- NT23 -> NT20 NT4\n- NT23 -> NT17 NT23 (but 17 is another non-terminal)\n- NT23 -> NT6 NT19\n- Others: Wait, I don't see NT23 directly producing a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the second symbol is 't62', which isn't directly produced by any of the NT23's rules. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe S is derived another way. Let's see S's other productions:\n\n- S->NT20 NT16\n- S->NT9 NT5 (as before)\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with S -> NT20 NT16 because the first symbol is NT5, and the second is 't62' \u2014 but that wouldn't fit. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has more than two symbols in some step of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each symbol and see what non-terminals they come from and then see if they can chain together.\n\nLet's list the string again: t26, t62, t78, t49, t59, t49, t1, t92, t59.\n\n- t26 is NT5.\n- t62 is an unknown, need to find a production that leads to it.\nHmm, wait, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces t62.\n\nLooking through all the terminals listed, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> t49\n- NT1 -> t30\nWait, in the grammar section, under NT23, there's NT23 -> 't49'.\n\nBut wait, 't62' isn't any of these. So perhaps t62 is an error, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the entire list:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, do any produce 't62'? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the given part of the grammar, I see some rules with 't's:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't47' and 't94'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT2 -> 't94'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT20 -> 't97'\n- NT18 -> 't92'\n- NT12 -> 't29'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- Others: NT23, NT1, NT21, NT8, etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any production that directly produces 't62'. So, that's a problem because the string has 't62' as the second symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in matching the symbols. Let me double-check the string:\n\nThe string is `t26 t62 t78 t49 t59 t49 t1 t92 t59`.\n\nSo the second symbol is t62, third is t78, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is being"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it means each production is a non-terminal breaking into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar has several non-terminals: S, NT23, NT30, NT15, NT7, NT1, NT29, NT19, NT18, NT3, NT24, NT4, NT6, NT12, NT10, NT27, NT0, NT21, NT23 (again), NT3, NT15, NT23 (again), NT10, NT27, NT19, etc. There are also a bunch of productions to terminals, like S->NT23 NT24 NT5, but wait, the string starts with t78, but S can't go directly to t78 because S produces combinations of non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, the non-terminals are all expanded into other non-terminals except for a few where some non-terminals go directly to terminals (like 't74', 't50', etc.). So the string in question consists of several terminal symbols, so the parser would trace back the steps to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by mapping each token in the string to possible non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-170","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The string is `t59 t50 t92 t59 t47 t82 t18 t94 t86 t18`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what a context-free grammar (CFG) is. It's a set of production rules that generate all possible strings of the language. Each production rule is from a non-terminal symbol to a sequence of symbols, which can be terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that B can be a terminal. Wait, actually, no\u2014CNF allows non-terminals to produce two symbols, which can be both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal, but typically in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. However, since in the given grammar, the right-hand sides have two symbols, sometimes both non-terminals, sometimes a mix, but some are directly terminals like 't59', etc. Wait, actually, no\u2014because in the provided grammar, some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, such as NT23 -> 't49', which means that 't49' is a terminal. So this grammar allows for terminals in the productions.\n\nBut wait, in standard CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals, except for the base case where A can be a terminal. So perhaps this is a mix or there's a slight variation because some right-hand sides have terminals. So the grammar allows terminals to appear directly, which is acceptable as part of the productions, but in that case, they can't appear beyond the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nSo the given string is a sequence of terminals: t59, t50, etc. The first step is to parse this string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar to understand the left-hand side and right-hand sides. The start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n- S -> NT24 NT24\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nEach of these is a pair of non-terminals, except that I notice in NT24 and NT16, which might resolve to terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT24, for example, there are productions like NT24 -> NT5 NT19. But I also see NT16 -> 't59'. So NT16 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't59'. Similarly, NT24 can produce 't1' (if I'm reading correctly\u2014look at NT24 later). Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has some rules where NT23 -> 't49', NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't47', etc. So some NT symbols directly produce terminals like t49, t50, etc.\n\nSo for example, NT23 -> 't49' means that NT23 can produce the terminal t49. Similarly, NT15 -> 't50', etc.\n\nSo the string ends with t59, t50, t92, etc. Let's take the first step of the string:\n\nThe string starts with t59. So the first symbol is t59, which comes from one of the productions of a non-terminal. Let's look for a production that ends with t59.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT20 -> NT26 NT30, among others. Wait, perhaps it's easier to see if any non-terminals produce t59 directly.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n\nSo NT16 produces t59. Similarly, NT2 -> 't94' because I see NT2 -> 't94'. Also, NT20 -> 't97', and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the first symbol of the string: t59, which comes from NT16 -> 't59'.\n\nSo the first rule that starts with NT16 would be a possible start. But wait, looking at the grammar, S is the start symbol, and the productions only have NT... symbols on the left, never terminal symbols except as part of the right-hand sides of the non-terminals.\n\nSo S must produce NT-pair, and then those NTs must be resolved into terminals and non-terminals to produce the string.\n\nSo the first step is to see which S production can lead to the first symbol t59.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\n1. S -> NT24 NT24\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nWe need to see which of these can start with t59.\n\nLet's see:\n\nLooking at each S production, their right-hand sides:\n\n1. NT24 NT24: Need to see what NT24 produces.\n2. NT20 NT16: NT20 and NT16. Both produce some terminals? Let's see NT20: looking at the grammar, NT20 -> 't97'? Wait, looking through the grammar: I see NT20 -> 't97'. So in this production, S -> NT20 NT16 would resolve to 't97' and 't59', giving a string starting with t97, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t59, so perhaps only productions that have a non-terminal that can produce t59 are relevant.\n\nLooking at the S productions:\n\nProduction 2: S -> NT20 NT16. So if NT20 can produce a terminal, then NT16 can also produce t59.\n\nWait, but wait, S -> NT20 NT16: so the first terminal is from NT20 and the second from NT16. If NT20 can produce 't97' and NT16 can produce 't59', then the first two symbols would be t97 t59. But in our string, the first two are t59 t50. So that's a mismatch, unless NT20 produces t59. Let me check if any NT20 production leads to t59.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT20 production that leads directly to t59. The only thing I see is NT20 -> 't97'. So NT20 can only produce t97. Therefore, in production 2, S -> NT20 NT16 would produce t97 t59. The string we have starts with t59 t50. So this production can't be the start since the first symbol is t59, not t97.\n\nProduction 1: S -> NT24 NT24. So both NT24s would produce some symbols. Let me check what NT24 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT24 has rules like:\n\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT19\n- NT24 -> NT1 NT9\n- NT24 -> NT26 NT19\n- NT24 -> NT19 NT19\n- NT24 -> NT22 NT7\n- NT24 -> 't1' ?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't28'\n- NT6 -> 't11 NT14? No, looking more carefully, I see NT24 -> 't1'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under \"grammar\" section, I see lines like:\n\nNT24 -> NT5 NT19\n...\nLooking further, under \"NT24 -> NT1 NT9\"\n...\nBut I don't see a production where NT24 directly produces a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm missing one. Let me scan the entire list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see various entries where NT24 appears as a non-terminal on the left-hand side. But none of them directly produce a terminal. So NT24 can only produce combinations of non-terminals. That means the first symbol in this production (S -> NT24 NT24) would be whatever NT24 produces, and so on, but since NT24 doesn't produce any terminals itself, perhaps this path won't produce a starting symbol like t59.\n\nProduction 3: S -> NT17 NT3. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT17: maybe it can produce t59? From the grammar, looking for NT17: I see NT17 -> NT23 NT2. So NT17 can produce NT23 NT2. Then, NT23 can produce 't49', perhaps?\n\nWait, let's trace that:\n\nNT17 -> NT23 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string `t59 t28 t92 t59 t50 t74 t78 t28 t47 t29 t18` is generated by the given context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's a set of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and is followed by two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S. The strings are built up by replacing the non-terminals with their respective production rules until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, which in this grammar map to the given string tokens like 't59', 't28', etc.\n\nEach production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. The left-hand side (LHS) is the non-terminal being replaced, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals. This is a tripling production structure.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of 11 tokens: `t59`, `t28`, `t92`, `t59`, `t50`, `t74`, `t78`, `t28`, `t47`, `t29`, `t18`. Each token is a terminal symbol, presumably from a limited set of terminals, with indices from t47 up to t97, I believe.\n\nMy approach should be to build the derivation tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string step by step, replacing non-terminals with terminals or other non-terminals as per the rules until the entire string is formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string from the bottom up using the production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, it's a binary CFG, meaning each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, all rules are A \u2192 BC, meaning that no terminals appear directly in the RHS. So this is an example of a CFG without epsilon productions but only binary productions.\n\nGiven that, each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one. Starting with S, which is a single non-terminal, and each rule adds more non-terminals, but ultimately, the string is built up by replacing each non-terminal with the RHS until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be tokenized into a sequence that matches the production rules. That is, each token in the string should correspond to a terminal in some production rule applicable at a certain step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of building the parse tree from the beginning, trying to apply the production rules to match the string token by token.\n\nLet me list the string again: `t59 t28 t92 t59 t50 t74 t78 t28 t47 t29 t18`\n\nFirst, I need to see which non-terminal productions can generate these tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, S can produce NT23 NT5, NT20 NT16, etc. Each production has two non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps the first step is to see if the first two tokens can form a production. The first token is t59. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t59.\n\nLooking through the RHS of the production rules, I see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT5: So NT23 produces the first token.\n\nLooking at NT23: the productions are:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT16 NT16\n\nWait, do any of these produce 't59'? Wait, no, the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. So each non-terminal must be replaced until it reaches a terminal. If a production rule has a terminal in its RHS, that's a leaf. But in this grammar, all rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, meaning no terminals. So every step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until we reach a point where a non-terminal's production includes a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, some of the productions have an edge case: for example, in NT23, I see NT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21, which is a recursive production, but no direct terminals except in some rules like:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nWait, some non-terminals have productions ending with a terminal, like:\n\nLooking through all the rules, for example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT16 NT16\n\nWait, all the productions in this grammar have non-terminals on the RHS. That can't be right because then the grammar would not have any terminals, meaning no string would be generated. But the given string is `t59 t28 t92 t59 t50 t74 t78 t28 t47 t29 t18`, so there must be some terminals, which are the tokens with 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps 't' followed by numbers are the terminals. So each token like 't59' is a terminal. So the grammar must have some production rules that include these terminals as output.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, perhaps some of the non-terminals have a production that includes a terminal. Let me check.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see rules like:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT24 NT5: Wait no, the grammar starts with S -> NT23 NT24 NT5? Wait no, looking again:\n\nThe first production rule is:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that can't be right because S is supposed to be the start symbol, and the RHS has three non-terminals, but the grammar is supposed to be in Chomsky normal form, which means each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, each line is a production rule.\n\nFor example:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that can't be correct because in Chomsky normal form, each production must be A \u2192 BC, so only two non-terminals on the RHS. Having three non-terminals would mean it's not CNF.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me look again. Perhaps the initial lines have typos or were split incorrectly.\n\nWait, perhaps S is defined as S -> NT23 NT24, and that's it? No, that can't be because in the initial lines, some lines have `S -> NT23 NT24 NT5`.\n\nThis is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the way the grammar was presented was incorrect, and perhaps each line is a production for the LHS symbol. So perhaps all lines starting with S, NT23, etc., are the productions for that symbol.\n\nBut the line starting with S has multiple possibilities:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, no, perhaps each line is a production rule for the respective non-terminal.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. That would mean the production S can be replaced by NT23 NT24 NT5. But that would have three symbols on the RHS, which is against Chomsky normal form unless they're terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production rule must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. So if we have S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, then NT23, NT24, and NT5 are non-terminals, which are each further expanded into two non-terminals, etc.\n\nBut in the grammar, perhaps it's written as multiple productions for each non-terminal. So for example:\n\nS has multiple productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nWait, this can't be, because S in CNF should have productions of the form S \u2192 XY, where X and Y are non-terminals. So having three non-terminals would violate CNF unless it's in extended form with more than two, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking back, perhaps each production is written as two tokens: symbol and then the RHS. So each line is a production rule like S \u2192 NT23 NT24."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-185","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I need to check is `t42 t26 t86 t18 t50 t78 t92 t59 t59 t29 t18`.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of two types: either a non-terminal S producing two non-terminals A and B, or a terminal a producing a single terminal symbol. The structure is usually like S -> AB or S -> a. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and allows for efficient algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll need another approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see all the productions either start with S or are from NT (Non-terminals) to two NTs except for some that end with terminals like 't42', etc. So, each production either expands into two non-terminals or a single terminal. That means for the string to be generated, every symbol, whether it's a non-terminal or a terminal, must follow some production path.\n\nWait, but in the string, all symbols are terminals except for the non-terminals. So, for example, the string starts with `t42`, which is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I have productions that start with 't42' like `NT16 -> t59`? No, let me check the grammar again. Actually, from the provided grammar, the terminal symbols are things like 't42', 't26', etc. So for example, NT24 -> t1, which means that NT24 can produce the terminal 't1'.\n\nBut in the string, we have t42, t26, t86, etc. I need to see if each of these terminals can be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string step by step, level by level, looking at each symbol and seeing which non-terminal it can come from.\n\nLet's list the symbols in the string: t42, t26, t86, t18, t50, t78, t92, t59, t59, t29, t18.\n\nStarting from the first symbol, t42. I need to find a production that leads to t42. Looking through the grammar, I find NT23 -> t69, but t42 is another symbol. Wait, maybe I need to check if t42 is a terminal or derived from a non-terminal. From the grammar, looking for NT23, I see that NT23 -> t42 because in one of the productions, it says \"NT23 -> t42\", yes, the user wrote it as `NT23 -> t42` because for the terminal t42, the production from NT23 is to 't42'. So in the string, the first symbol is t42, which is directly produced by NT23.\n\nSo, the first symbol t42 comes from NT23.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t26. Looking for which non-terminal produces t26. In the grammar, I find NT25 -> t26. So t26 comes from NT25.\n\nThe third symbol is t86. Looking for NT that produces t86. In the grammar, I see NT12 -> t29? Wait, no, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me scan the grammar. Wait, looking for t86, I see that NT30 -> t86. Yes, in the grammar, NT30 has a production to t86. So t86 comes from NT30.\n\nFourth symbol: t18. Looking for NT that produces t18. In the grammar, I see NT18 -> t18. So NT18 produces t18.\n\nContinuing, the fifth symbol is t50.

Checking the grammar, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces t92. Hmm, so perhaps t92 must be produced by a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the string again: t42 t26 t86 t18 t50 t78 t92 t59 t59 t29 t18.\n\nLet me try to break it down more carefully.\n\nt42 comes from NT23.\n\nt26 comes from NT25.\n\nt86 comes from NT30.\n\nt18 comes from NT18.\n\nt50 comes from NT15.\n\nt78 comes from NT11.\n\nt92: Hmm, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t92. So perhaps t92 is in the middle of a chain.\n\nWait, let's look for which non-terminals can produce t92. Maybe through some other paths.\n\nLooking through the grammar: I see that NT8 -> t91, NT7 -> t82, etc. Not seeing t92 yet.\n\nWait, let me check all the productions for NT that might lead to t92.\n\nWait, perhaps t92 is the result of a longer expansion. Let's think about it differently. Maybe t92 is part of a non-terminal's production. For example, maybe NT28 can produce t92, but I don't see that in the productions. Let me scan each non-terminal production.\n\nLooking for any NT productions that include t92.\n\nIn the grammar, looking for a production where a non-terminal is replaced by t92.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT -> t92. So perhaps I need to see if t92 is in some larger string that's a result of several non-terminals expanding.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake earlier. Let me check t42 again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet's consider the string as a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production must split into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal (as I mentioned earlier).\n\nSo, each symbol in the string must be either a terminal produced directly by a non-terminal or the result of multiple steps where each step is a direct production to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of terminals, and each one must appear as the result of a production that either comes directly from a non-terminal or is part of a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see the entire string as a series of terminal replacements.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the string as the leftmost derivation, using the productions.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree.\n\nStarting with t42, which comes from NT23.\n\nBut wait, t42 is part of the string, so in the derivation, it must be that the NT23 is expanded into t42.\n\nBut in the string, we have t42 as the first symbol. So, the first symbol is from NT23, which is the start symbol? No, the start symbol is S. So perhaps the initial expansion starts with S, and each production is processed until we get to the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think that each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which are then expanded until we get to terminals.\n\nSince the string has 11 symbols, all terminals, it's possible that each terminal is the result of a non-terminal being expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assigning t42 to NT23. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for NT23 is: NT23 -> t42. Yes, that's correct. So in the string, the first symbol is t42, so that must come from the NT23.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is t26, which comes from NT25.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is S -> AB or S->a. So, the string is built by replacing symbols step by step.\n\nBut since the string is a series of terminals, I think each terminal must correspond to a production where a non-terminal directly expands into that terminal.\n\nSo, for example, t42 comes from NT23, t26 comes from NT25, etc.\n\nWait, but that would mean each terminal is a direct production. However, the entire string is built by such steps. So, the derivation would start with S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nIn this case, each terminal in the string must be directly produced by some non-terminal, because there are no productions where a non-terminal expands into more than two non-terminals except for the initial S.\n\nWait, the initial S must expand into two non-terminals, each of which can then expand into two non-terminals, etc.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-207","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string `t59 t86 t50 t62 t28 t62 t29 t50 t91 t42 t78 t26` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which has only production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided and see how the string is structured. Since the grammar uses symbols like S, NT23, NT30, etc., and terminals like 't59', 't50', etc., I can see that some of these are terminals and some are non-terminals. \n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce several non-terminals like NT23, NT20, NT17, etc. Each of these non-terminals can further produce combinations of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with 't59', I look up how that terminal is generated. In the grammar, 't59' appears as a production of NT16. So, to get 't59', we must have the production NT16 \u2192 't59'.\n\nNext, I check the second symbol in the string, which is 't86'. Looking at NT16's production rules, I don't see 't86' directly. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I might have missed something. Let me check each NT16 production.\n\nHmm, I see that NT16 has two productions: one involving NT6 and another producing terminals. Wait, no, looking again, NT16 is only present in the non-terminals as part of other productions, like in S \u2192 NT20 NT16. Wait, no, in the context of larger expansions. I might be confusing NT16 with other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The string is a sequence of symbols, but given that it's in Chomsky normal form, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. However, the string here seems to be a sequence of terminals, which suggests that the derivation involved multiple steps where non-terminals were replaced by terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production in the string is a direct replacement of a non-terminal symbol by a terminal symbol, meaning that the string is a direct expansion where each step produces one terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the string is built up by successively expanding non-terminals into pairs of symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, the string is a linear sequence of terminals. To derive this string, we'd need a leftmost derivation where each non-terminal is expanded step by step, leading to the final string.\n\nGiven that, I can try building the derivation.\n\nLet's see if the string can be derived by working from the top down. Starting with S, which produces combinations of non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of 12 symbols, and each production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, the number of steps needed would be such that the number of productions is log2(n), but maybe not exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for whether the given string is a possible sequence of rightmost or leftmost derivations based on the grammar's productions.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar and the string, it's quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the structure of the grammar and see if the terminals in the string appear in the possible productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several non-terminals produce a terminal followed by another non-terminal or terminal. For example, NT15 \u2192 't50' and NT18 \u2192 't59'. But 't59' also appears as a production from NT26 via some chain.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the possible terminals that appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, 't50' is produced by NT15. 't59' is produced by NT26 \u2192 't59'. 't86' doesn't appear in the provided terminal list. Wait, no, let me see: in the given grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT9 NT5, NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17, etc., but looking at the list, many of the non-terminals produce terminals like 't49', 't50', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT15 \u2192 't50', NT2 \u2192 't47', etc. So, 't50' is a terminal, but 't86' doesn't appear in the grammar's terminals. Wait, wait, the string includes 't86', but in the provided grammar, does any non-terminal produce 't86'?\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT23 \u2192 't42', but 't86' isn't listed as a terminal anywhere. Let me double-check. The grammar has:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't47'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- Others:\n\nLooking for 't86', yes, NT30 \u2192 't86' is present.\n\nSimilarly, 't59' is produced by NT26 \u2192 't59'.\n\nSo, the first two terminals in the string are 't59' and 't86'. \n\nSo, to produce 't59 t86 ...', the string starts with 't59', which is produced by NT26. Then, 't86' must come from another NT30.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't59' comes 't86', so maybe we have a rule where NT30 \u2192 't86', but what's before NT30?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial symbol S generates NT20 and NT16. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT NT5 ???\n\nWait, no, the grammar provided is a bit confusing because the user wrote S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5, etc. Wait, let me look again.\n\nThe first rule is:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that's an unusual grammar structure because it's S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT5. But in Chomsky normal form, each production should be A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, each production would have S on the left, and on the right side, each production is either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S has multiple production rules, each of which has S being replaced by two non-terminals, except maybe one or more produce terminals.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Each rule should be S \u2192 NT23 NT24 and another S \u2192 NT5? That can't be, because usually, each production is a single rule. Wait, the user might have made a typo or formatting issue. Let me check the actual grammar provided.\n\nLooking at the user's grammar:\n\nIt starts with:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nWait, that can't be correct as per Chomsky normal form because each production should be either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So, 'S -> NT23 NT24 NT5' would require the production to have three symbols on the right, which is not allowed. That suggests a formatting error.\n\nBut looking again, perhaps it's a typographical error. The correct way would be that S has multiple production rules, each where S is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's a multi-step expansion where the NT symbols produce sequences. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended that S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can further produce sequences.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's re-examine the provided grammar rules for S.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- S appears only on the left side, and the production rules are multiple, each of which seems to replace S with two non-terminals. For example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\n\nWait, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT5\n\nBut if each production is S \u2192 something, then the way it's written would make each rule a combination, but perhaps that's not the case. Maybe it's a formatting issue.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of terminals and non-terminals. The given grammar has symbols like S, NT23, NT30, etc., which I assume are non-terminals, and others like 't1', 't50', etc., which are terminals. The productions are all left-hand sides (LHS) and right-hand sides (RHS) involving these symbols.\n\nThe string starts with several terminals like 't1', 't50', etc. I'll need to see if there's a derivation path that starts with the start symbol S and results in this string by applying the productions step by step, ending with the given string.\n\nLooking at the productions, the start symbol S can go to various combinations: for example, S -> NT23 NT5, which seems to be one of them. I should also note that each production is in the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but in the current grammar, some productions are missing or have the form A -> BC, but maybe there are cases where terminals can appear on the RHS. I think in Chomsky normal form, a CFG can have productions like A -> a, but in the given grammar, I'm not seeing any immediate terminals except the target ones like 't1', 't50', etc. So perhaps in this case, the RHS of productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, looking again, some RHS have just two non-terminals, some have two terminals, but in the given grammar, all RHS seem to have two non-terminals because terminals are only towards the end.\n\nWait, no, the productions do have some with terminals, for example: NT7 -> 't24', NT8 -> 't19', NT2 -> 't94', etc. So some productions end up introducing terminals, so the derivation must proceed through these steps.\n\nNow, looking at the given string, it alternates between 't' and non-'t' tokens. The string is: t1 t50 t74 t92 t59 t94 t97 t92 t59 t1 t23 t49.\n\nFirst, I'll list the order of the tokens to see if they can be broken down into possible production steps:\n\n1. t1\n2. t50\n3. t74\n4. t92\n5. t59\n6. t94\n7. t97\n8. t92\n9. t59\n10. t1\n11. t23\n12. t49\n\nI need to find a sequence of productions that when applied, starting from S, produce this string in the correct order.\n\nLooking at S's productions, the first step would be to choose one of the rules starting from S. For example:\n\nS -> NT23 NT5\n\nThen, each of NT23 and NT5 would be further expanded. Or another option is S -> NT20 NT16, but I'm not sure if that leads me closer to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to derive each 't' string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of breaking down the given string into parts and see if each part corresponds to a production.\n\nLet me try to parse the string as a sequence of terminals and see if they can be grouped into the production rules.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to see if the string is a valid derivation tree by checking each element against the grammar.\n\nBut this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string matches a production rule in the grammar that has that terminal as a RHS.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, several non-terminals have direct productions to terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't24' ( production: NT7 \u2192 't24')\n- NT10 \u2192 't17' ( production: NT10 \u2192 't17')\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' ( production: NT15 \u2192 't50')\n- NT17 \u2192 't59' ( production: NT17 \u2192 't59')\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' ( production: NT20 \u2192 't97')\n- NT23 \u2192 't49' ( production: NT23 \u2192 't49')\n- NT28 \u2192 't80' ( production: NT28 \u2192 't80')\n- NT29 \u2192 't29' ( production: NT29 \u2192 't29')\n- NT30 \u2192 't29' ( production: NT30 \u2192 't29')\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' ( production: NT3 \u2192 't1')\n- NT4 \u2192 't26' ( production: NT4 \u2192 't26')\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' ( production: NT5 \u2192 't26')\n- NT6 \u2192 't28' ( production: NT6 \u2192 't28')\n- NT8 \u2192 't19' ( production: NT8 \u2192 't19')\n- NT9 \u2192 't78' ( production: NT9 \u2192 't78')\n- NT11 \u2192 't18' ( production: NT11 \u2192 't18')\n- NT12 \u2192 't29' ( production: NT12 \u2192 't29')\n- NT14 \u2192 't69' ( production: NT14 \u2192 't69')\n- NT16 \u2192 't59' ( production: NT16 \u2192 't59')\n- NT18 \u2192 't92' ( production: NT18 \u2192 't92')\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' ( production: NT20 \u2192 't97')\n- NT21 \u2192 't1' ( production: NT21 \u2192 't1')\n- NT23 \u2192 't24' ( production: NT23 \u2192 't24')\n- NT24 \u2192 't1' ( production: NT24 \u2192 't1')\n- NT26 \u2192 't23' ( production: NT26 \u2192 't23')\n- NT27 \u2192 't16' ( production: NT27 \u2192 't16')\n- NT28 \u2192 't42' ( production: NT28 \u2192 't42')\n- NT30 \u2192 't86' ( production: NT30 \u2192 't86')\n- NT1 \u2192 't62' ( production: NT1 \u2192 't62')\n\nSo, each 't' symbol in the string matches a production rule. Now, the question is whether these terminal symbols can be part of a valid derivation.\n\nBut to do that, I need to see if the starting symbol S can derive the string step by step by expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals or into terminals.\n\nGiven that the given string is of length 12, the derivation would involve 12 steps (since each step replaces a non-terminal with RHS, and each token in the string would result from an application of a production).\n\nHowever, given the structure of the grammar, each production only introduces two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal or vice versa). But in the given string, there's a mix of non-terminal and terminal steps.\n\nWait, but the string only contains terminals, so perhaps it's a question of whether the entire string can be generated by the grammar, meaning every production step must eventually result in a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string can be split into parts that correspond to the RHS of certain production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nLet me consider the string and try to identify possible splits:\n\nThe string is: t1 t50 t74 t92 t59 t94 t97 t92 t59 t1 t23 t49.\n\nLooking for 't's, each corresponds to a production.\n\nLet me see the order:\n\n1. t1: must come from a production with RHS as 't1' or a non-terminal that produces 't1'. Looking at the productions, we have NT3 \u2192 't1', NT5 \u2192 't26' (but I think that's wrong, wait. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions, the only NT that directly produces 't1' is NT3 \u2192 't1' and NT21 \u2192 't1'. Wait, looking:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' ( production: NT3 \u2192 't1')\n- NT21 \u2192 't1' ( production: NT21 \u2192 't1')\n\nSo, t1 can come from either NT3 or NT21.\n\nSimilarly, t50 comes from NT15.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with NT15 and then splits into other components.\n\nBut this is getting complex; perhaps I should approach it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-227","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is `t59 t28 t91 t18 t29 t18 t26 t74 t78 t49 t69 t59 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side, so it definitely fits CNF.\n\nThe task is to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with t and ends with t, so let me map each token to the grammar to see their correspondences. \n\nLooking through the grammar, several terminals are present as strings:\n- t59 corresponds to NT9 from the rule NT9 \u2192 t59 (I think, but wait, I need to check the grammar entries. Oh, let me see: looking at the production NT9, I see it has right-hand sides like NT5 NT2, NT26 NT17, etc. Oh, wait, but none of the productions directly end with t59. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the terminals are actually fixed, like t59 is a terminal, as seen in the rules. Wait, the grammar has productions where the right side is a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 t69 meaning that token is a terminal. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, the productions have right-hand sides either with two non-terminals or with a terminal. So, the terminals in the string correspond to specific production rules that generate those terminals. \n\nSo first, let me parse each token in the string and see which non-terminals they correspond to:\n\n- t59: Looking through the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 t59. So t59 is generated by NT9.\n- t28: Checking which NT leads to t28. I see NT2 \u2192 t94, NT5 \u2192 t26, NT7 \u2192 t82, NT26 \u2192 t69, etc. Wait, let me find where t28 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 t82, but perhaps I'm missing. Wait, maybe I should organize the terminals. Let's go through all the productions and note which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nWait, actually, from the given grammar, it seems that each terminal is associated with a specific NT production. So, t59 is associated with NT9, t28 with NT7, t91 with NT15, t18 with NT16, t29 with NT23, t69 with NT26, t74 with NT24, t78 with NT11, t49 with NT22, t62 with NT2 (as per the rule NT2 \u2192 t94 I think? Wait, no, let me look. The user input shows a list where some are written as NT... followed by an arrow and another NT or a terminal. For example, some entries are \"NT2 \u2192 t94\", others are \"NT21 \u2192 t21\". \n\nWait, perhaps the way the grammar is presented is that each production is of the form NT... \u2192 (other NTs or terminals). So, for instance, NT5 \u2192 t26 would mean that NT5 can produce the terminal t26. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 t69 would mean that NT26 generates t69.\n\nBut wait, the way the grammar is written, each line is of the form NT{something} \u2192 {something else}, either two NTs or a terminal. So for example, \"NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT3\" is a production, and \"NT22 \u2192 t69\" is another production where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, each terminal is a single token, like t59, t28, etc. So I need to find which NTs produce these tokens.\n\nFirst, let me list out the terminals and which NTs produce them:\n\n- t59: Looking through the productions, I see that NT9 \u2192 t59 (since one of the lines is \"NT9 -> t59 NT...\"? Wait, wait, looking back, the grammar has lines like \"NT9 -> NT5 NT2\", \"NT9 -> NT5 NT6\", etc. Wait, perhaps I need to parse it again.\n\nWait a minute, no. Let me look at the grammar again carefully. The grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT5 \u2192 but wait, actually, looking at the user input:\n\nThe grammar starts with lines like:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT? Wait no, that can't be because in the user's input, each production is written as NT... -> something. So each production is left-hand side (NT) and right-hand side. For example, the first lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT?\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the first production is \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT24\", which probably is a typo or an error, but perhaps it's a mistake because all other productions are of the form NT... \u2192 NT1 NT2, except for several terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking again. The user wrote:\n\nThe grammar starts with lines like:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT?\nNo, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the user meant that each production is in the form NT{number} \u2192 {something}, either two NTs or a single symbol.\n\nWait, let me parse the user's grammar correctly:\n\nThe first lines are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT5\nWait, but that would be four symbols on the right-hand side, which is not valid because in Chomsky Normal Form, the right-hand side must be two symbols, either both non-terminals or both terminals, or perhaps terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, meaning that each production is two symbols. So the user's grammar should have all productions of that form.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the first line: \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT24 NT5\" \u2192 that's three symbols: two NTs and a terminal? No, that can't be right. That would violate CNF because it's A \u2192 BCD, which is three symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, and all productions are two symbols, except for some that produce terminals as a single symbol.\n\nWait, for example, \"NT23 -> NT5 NT25\" is two symbols, which is fine. But another line is \"NT15 -> t50\", which would be a terminal, which is also fine because it's a single symbol. So perhaps the S production is written incorrectly. Maybe it's actually a production of two symbols, but in the user's input, it's written with three or four parts. Alternatively, maybe the first S production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Perhaps the user broke it into multiple lines for readability.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me take a different approach. I'll scan through the entire grammar and note each production's RHS: whether it's two symbols.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to parse the user's grammar correctly. Each production is written as \"NTx -> RHS\", where RHS can be two non-terminals, or a terminal, or maybe one non-terminal and two symbols? Wait, no, in CNF, all productions produce exactly two symbols, which can be two non-terminals, a terminal and a non-terminal, or two terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's S production is incorrect, but perhaps it's a typo, and the correct productions are all of the form two symbols, including terminals.\n\nBut this could be a mistake. Let me proceed with the assumption that all the productions are correct as per CNF, and for each production, the RHS is a combination of two symbols.\n\nSo looking through the given grammar, all lines have either two NTs or a terminal. So, the first few lines have, for example, \"NT23 -> NT5 NT25\", which is two NTs.\n\nSo each production in the grammar is in CNF, producing either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nNow, let's look at the string to be evaluated: `t59 t28 t91 t18 t29 t18 t26 t74 t78 t49 t69 t59 t69`.\n\nEach token in this string is a terminal. So the entire string can be seen as a sequence of terminals, starting with t59, then t28, etc. The task is to find a derivation from S that produces this string.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a parsing problem, starting from S and seeing if we can expand it step by step until we reach the given string.

Let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. I also recall that the language generated by a grammar in CNF can be determined using the CYK algorithm, which parses the string based on the grammar's rules. However, since this grammar has a lot of rules and non-terminals, maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal. These are the leaves in the parse tree, so I should list all of them to identify the possible terminals in the language:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't49' \n- NT21 \u2192 't21'\n- NT9 \u2192 't91'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' (duplicate, same as above)\n- NT28 \u2192 't80'\n- NT3 \u2192 't47'\n- NT8 \u2192 't91' (duplicate)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT1 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT30 \u2192 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69'\n- NT30 \u2192 't86'\n- NT15 \u2192 't74'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42' (duplicate)\n- NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT9 \u2192 't78' (duplicate)\n- NT11 \u2192 't18'\n- NT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nSo the terminals in this grammar are t49, t21, t91, t80, t47, t92, t80, t1, t94, t26, t28, t97, t86, t78, t62, t92, etc. Wait, some are repeated. Let's list the unique terminals:\n\nt1, t21, t26, t28, t18, t29, t42 (though maybe not relevant), t47, t59, t69, t74, t78, t80, t82, t86, t91, t92, t94, t97.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: `t59 t29 t18 t92 t59 t18 t21 t18 t86 t49 t50 t94 t26`.\n\nWait, the string has 't50' as one of its tokens. But looking back at the grammar, none of the non-terminals produce 't50'. From the list above, I see NT15 \u2192 't50', but in the list above, the terminal for NT15 is 't74', not 't50'. Wait, checking the grammar again:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50' ?\n\nLooking back at the rules provided, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't91'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT20 \u2192 't97'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't92'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't86'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't74'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't42'\n\nNT16 \u2192 't59'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't78'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't62'\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't50' as a terminal. The only non-terminals that produce terminals are those that have 't49', 't21', 't91', etc. But 't50' is missing. So the string contains 't50', which is not possible according to the grammar because there is no production rule that produces 't50'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me scan the entire grammar again carefully. I see lines like NT15 \u2192 't50'? Is that correct? Looking again: the rule for NT15 should be NT15 \u2192 't50'? Let me check the grammar. Looking through the provided production rules:\n\n- The lines under NT15 seem to produce 't74' and other things, like NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT23 or NT15 \u2192 NT23 NT27? Wait no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, looking for any production where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal. Oh, here's a line:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50'? No, let me check each line:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n- NT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n- NT7 \u2192 NT22 NT27\n- NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT3\n- NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT19 \u2192 NT23 NT27\n- NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT26\n- NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT22\n- NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11\n- NT4 \u2192 NT15 NT26\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT22\n- NT10 \u2192 NT7 NT8\n- NT27 \u2192 NT2 NT23\n- NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n- NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT4\n- NT10 \u2192 NT19 NT12\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT21 \u2192 NT5 NT14\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT5\n- NT20 \u2192 NT28 NT0\n- NT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21\n- NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25\n- NT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22\n- NT12 \u2192 NT18 NT28\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\n- NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT28\n- NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT30\n- NT12 \u2192 NT29 NT9\n- NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT12 \u2192 NT22 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\n- NT11 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT28\n- NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT30\n- NT12 \u2192 NT29 NT9\n- NT1 \u2192 NT30 NT27\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT12 \u2192 NT22 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3\n- NT2 \u2192 NT25 NT19\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\n- NT12 \u2192 NT26 NT7\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT14 \u2192 NT26 NT17\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30\n- NT3 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n- NT20 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT10 \u2192 NT11 NT10\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT14 \u2192 NT26 NT17\n- NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT27\n- NT28 \u2192 NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-252","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t78 t74 t18 t78 t49 t28 t49 t97 t78 t49 t69 t49 t18 t92`. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are the t-something strings, like t78, t49, etc. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT1, NT2, etc., as well as some terminals like t78 which are directly in the string as terminals.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t78 and t74. Let's check the grammar to see if there are any terminals in the productions of the non-terminals. Yes, some of the NT rules produce terminals, for example:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT0 NT3\n- NT2 \u2192 NT25 NT19\n- ... and so on.\n\nBut looking at the NT productions, the only terminals I can see are t74, t78, t97, t28, etc., but most are non-terminals. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see that some NT rules produce a single terminal. For instance:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n- And other combinations, but actually, some rules produce two terminals. Wait, no, the grammar as given seems to have some rules that produce two non-terminals (like NT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21, but that's a production to two non-terminals). But perhaps some rules produce a mix, but looking closely, perhaps the only terminals are in certain places.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that the grammar has rules where some non-terminals produce two non-terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4, but NT9 is another non-terminal that might eventually produce a terminal. However, in the given string, all the elements are t-something, meaning terminals. So the question is, does the grammar have any way to generate a terminal sequence that is this.\n\nLet me first check if all terminals in the string are present as terminals in the grammar. The string has t78, t74, t18, t49, t28, t97, t92, t69. Looking through the grammar, some of these are indeed terminals. For example:\n\n- t74 is present in the grammar (NT22 \u2192 t74)\n- t49 is present (NT15 \u2192 t50, but wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see NT7 \u2192 't74'? No, wait, actually, looking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t28\n\nNT20 \u2192 t97\n\nNT18 \u2192 t92\n\nNT26 \u2192 t84 (I'm not sure, perhaps I misread). Wait, looking through the end segments:\n\nLooking through the grammar, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t69\n\nNT15 \u2192 t50\n\nNT2 \u2192 t94\n\nNT5 \u2192 t26\n\nNT22 \u2192 t28\n\nNT20 \u2192 t97\n\nNT18 \u2192 t92\n\nSo, yes, t74 is NT22 \u2192 t28? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar is a long list. I think I might have made a mistake in earlier analysis. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the grammar, some of the rules end with terminals. For example:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t84? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look carefully at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, at the end:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50'\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The grammar seems to have some rules that end with 't's. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t28 (I think in an earlier part, like NT22's production might be t28)\n\nWait, looking through the grammar more carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, there are several lines that have 't's:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT26 \u2192 t69\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT1 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, so for example, NT27 \u2192 't49' is a production. Similarly, NT15 \u2192 't50', NT2 \u2192 't94', etc. So each of these is a production where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal with a specific number.\n\nSo, in the string, t78 is present. Is there any rule where a non-terminal produces t78? Let's check the grammar. Yes, looking for t78:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t21, but wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t21 (Is this correct? Or perhaps a typo). Wait, looking back:\n\nNo, actually, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar provided step by step.\n\nThe user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me parse through them more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the lines, I notice that some rules produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 ND6\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the grammar line by line.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe line NT2 \u2192 t94: so NT2 can produce the terminal 't94'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 t26.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t22.\n\nNT26 \u2192 t69.\n\nNT27 \u2192 t49.\n\nNT15 \u2192 t74?\n\nWait, no: The lines say:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20 NT16\n2. S \u2192 NT20 NT16\n3. S \u2192 NT17 NT3\n4. S \u2192 NT20 NT6\n5.

{"custom_id":"request-246","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, every production either produces one terminal or exactly two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see that most of the productions fit into this form, like S \u2192 NT24 NT5, which are two non-terminals. There are some rules that directly produce a terminal, like S \u2192 NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which I think will eventually lead to terminal symbols, but let me check.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t92 t28 t18 t94 t28 t74 t86 t18 t94 t59 t59 t78 t42 t28`. I notice that all elements are single-character strings, presumably terminals. So, the first step is to see which non-terminals these terminals correspond to.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals, so any string generated by the grammar must be a sequence of terminals, and the way they come together must follow the rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is a bit long, maybe I can look for terminal symbols and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nLet me scan the productions for rules that directly produce terminals. I see lines like NT15 \u2192 't50', NT4 \u2192 't26', NT2 \u2192 't94', etc. These are terminal symbols. So, the strategy is to see if the string can be broken down into these terminals following the rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll list all the terminal symbols present: t92, t28, t18, t94, t74, t86, t59, t78, t42. Hmm, I need to check if each of these corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar and how they can be generated.\n\nWait, for example, t92 is associated with NT18 \u2192 't92', and t28 is from NT28 \u2192 't80'. But wait, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT28 directly producing 't80'\u2014looking back, I see that in the grammar, after NT28 comes a 't80'. Similarly, t18 is from NT18 \u2192 't92', which I think might not be correct. Wait, let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking more carefully, the productions for NT18 include NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT26. So, NT18 is split into NT10 and NT26, which might further split into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. Since the string consists of these t's, I need to check if each of these t's is generated by a non-terminal and if their sequence can be formed according to the rules.\n\nLet me try to list the non-terminals that produce each terminal:\n\n- t92: NT18\n- t28: NT28\n- t18: NT18 (Wait, no, looking back, I see production NT18 \u2192 't92', so t18 is from NT18.\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT18 is defined as NT10 NT26, and NT10 is NT7 NT8, and NT8 is NT1 NT28. So, this seems a bit tangled. Let me see if I can trace back the rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look at the string and see how the non-terminals would split. Let's break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t92 t28 t18 t94 t28 t74 t86 t18 t94 t59 t59 t78 t42 t28.\n\nLet me see the order: t92, t28, t18, t94, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign each terminal to its respective non-terminal and then see how they can chain together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of each t as being produced by a specific non-terminal and then build a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nLet me attempt that.\n\nt92: according to the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't92', but wait, looking at the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT26. So, to produce t92, we need NT10 and NT26 to eventually produce t82? Wait, no, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I have a mistake here. Let me check again: the grammar says NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT26, and NT10 is NT19 NT12. NT26 is NT8 NT26, which seems recursive, but wait, that would loop.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a set of rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand sides consist of two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the given grammar. I see a bunch of rules, all starting with S, NT, or other non-terminals. For example, S can become NT23 NT24, which are both non-terminals. The base case has some terminals like 't49', 't50', etc. So the goal is to parse the string using these rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t59 t26 t62 t28 t47 t49 t59 t18 t47 t78 t28 t49 t74 t49 t18.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each step of the derivation adds exactly one non-terminal or a terminal. The string length is 15, so each symbol in the string (except the terminals?) represents a step. Wait, no\u2014each symbol is either a terminal or the left-hand side of a rule, but in CNF, the RHS is two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals because all the symbols are like t59, t26, etc. So I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to perform a derivation starting from S, applying the rules step by step, and see if I can reach the string.\n\nBut manually doing this for a string of length 15 might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for any patterns or reductions that can take place.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n1. S has several options, like NT23 NT24, etc. Each of these is a pair of non-terminals, so the first step is S \u2192 something.\n\n2. Let's pick S \u2192 NT23 NT24.

NT15 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first symbol is t59. Where does t59 come from?

Both of these are non-terminals, but looking at the string, I have t59 as the third symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look for any NT that directly goes to 't59'.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT3, but 3 is a terminal.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- NT5 is connected to t26 via NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n- NT16 \u2192 't59' as a terminal? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT16 in some rules, but the right-hand side is always another non-terminal or terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is `t59 t74 t92 t59 t47 t94 t92 t59 t23 t18 t91 t18 t47 t86 t18`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given grammar structure. The grammar has multiple non-terminals and terminals. The left-hand side of each production is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminals. Some of these non-terminals seem to eventually produce terminal symbols, which are the strings like 't59', 't74', etc. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's 'S'. The initial production rules for S are:\n- S -> NT24 NT24\n- S -> NT20 NT16\n- S -> NT17 NT3\n- S -> NT20 NT6\n- S -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, from S, we can expand into various combinations of non-terminals. The string starts with t59, which is a terminal. So I need to find a production path that leads from S to a sequence starting with t59.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals can produce t59. Looking through the productions, I see that NT16 -> t59 is a production. That means if I can get to NT16, expanding it would give me t59. Similarly, checking other NTs that produce terminals:\n\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT8 -> t91\n- NT17 -> t19\n- NT23 -> t49 or others\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT25 -> 't30' and others?\n\nWait, no, looking back, most NTs eventually produce a 't' followed by a number, but some produce something else, like 't' with higher numbers or perhaps other non-terminals.\n\nWait, the initial list of productions has several NTs that are non-terminals, and some produce terminals. For example, NT16 -> t59. So if a path exists where a NT16 is produced, it contributes to t59 in the string.\n\nThe string starts with t59, so let's see how we can get to NT16. The initial rule for S includes S-> NT20 NT16. So if the first expansion is S->NT20 NT16, then the first symbol after expansion would be NT20 and NT16. But in the string, the first symbol is t59, so perhaps that's not the path.\n\nWait, wait, no. The string is a list of terminals, so the entire string must be the result of fully expanding the non-terminals into terminals. So each production rule applies, and non-terminals get expanded until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, the string is `t59 t74 t92 t59 t47 t94 t92 t59 t23 t18 t91 t18 t47 t86 t18`. Let me count the tokens: 15 symbols, so the derivation should consist of 14 steps (since each production adds one non-terminal, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production splits into two non-terminals, so the number of steps to reach terminals from S could vary).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree bottom-up. Let me check each symbol in the string and see what NTs could produce them.\n\nt59 is produced by NT16.\n\nt74: Looking at the productions, NT23->t49 for some, but I don't see an NT23->t74. Wait, looking back, let's check all productions for terminals:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT23->... (several, but not t74)\n- NT7->t82\n- NT24->t1\n- NT18->t92\n- NT20->t97\n- NT25->t30? No, looking back, I don't see any NTs that directly produce t74 except maybe NT23, but does NT23 produce t74?\n\nWait, going through the list again, I see that NT23 has productions:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT23 -> ... other non-terminals, but none that directly produce t74. So NT23 might not produce t74. Alternatively, perhaps through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NTs and their productions again to see which produce which terminals.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce t74: Scanning all, I don't see any NT directly producing t74. So t74 must be produced by a longer chain. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a pair of non-terminals. So unless there's a production chain that eventually leads to t74, t74 can't appear in the string. But the given string has t74, which suggests it must have a production path.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT23 -> t49\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT25 -> t30 (Wait, no: looking, I see:\n\nWait, under NT23: NT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nAnd also, some other productions involving NT23, but no direct t74.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in scanning. Let's look again in the entire list. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT23-> NT5 NT25\n- NT23-> NT6 NT9\n- NT23-> NT9 NT4\n- NT23-> NT20 NT4\n- NT23-> NT3 NT0\n- NT23->... others, but none produce t74.\n\nWait, so perhaps t74 isn't a terminal that any NT directly produces, but that can't be because the string includes t74. So perhaps I need to re-examine the productions more carefully.\n\nWait, looking again: line by line.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n- NT23-> NT6 NT9\n- NT18-> NT23 NT27\n- NT28-> NT20 NT18\nWait, wait, but NT28 produces t86, which is in the string. Let me see: the string has t86 towards the end. Let's see how t86 is produced. NT28->t86.\n\nNow, looking back, NT28 has productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT18\n- NT23 -> NT23 NT21\n- NT28 -> NT4 NT22\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps t74 is produced by some other path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe t74 is produced by a non-terminal that isn't listed, but that can't be because the grammar only has the given non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which NTs produce which terminals. Let me list all the NTs and their terminal productions:\n\nLet me go through each production line to see which NTs end up being terminals:\n\nNo, that would take too long, but perhaps I can approach this by walking through the string step by step, trying to see possible expansions.\n\nWait, the string starts with t59, which is from NT16, so perhaps the first expansion is S->NT20 NT16, but the first symbol is t59, which is from NT16, so that makes sense as the first element. So the first part of the expansion is getting NT16 to t59, and then what comes next.\n\nWait, but the second symbol is t74, which is also a terminal. So in the string, the second token is t74, which must come from some NT that produces t74. Or perhaps it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, but according to the given productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t74. So unless t74 is produced by a multi-step process, the grammar can't produce t74 directly, which would make the string invalid. But the string includes t74, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the NT23 productions again. I see that NT23 can produce:\n\n- NT5 NT25\n- NT6 NT9\n- NT9 NT4\n- NT20 NT4\n- NT3 NT0\n\nNone of these directly produce a terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token looks like 't' followed by a number. From the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals produce these tokens, perhaps as terminals in the language. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the non-terminals and see which ones can produce these tokens. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that several non-terminals like NT23, NT24, NT26, NT28, etc., eventually produce a single token 't' followed by a number. For example, NT21 \u2192 't21', NT5 \u2192 't26', and so on. So, these are the terminal symbols in the language.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t23 t29 t18 t26 t80 t82 t28 t91 t49 t18 t18 t59 t59 t50 t94 t28`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting from S, the grammar has several productions. Let's see which ones can generate parts of the string. The string starts with 't23', so I look for non-terminals that can produce 't23'. Looking at the grammar, I notice NT23 \u2192 't49' but that's not helpful here. Wait, maybe there are other productions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 can produce NT5 NT20 by one rule, and then from NT5, it goes to NT10 NT17, and so on. That seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe a direct production from a non-terminal to 't23' exists. Looking through, I see that some non-terminals end up as 't23' indirectly, but I need to find a path where a non-terminal directly produces 't23'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: if a non-terminal can directly produce a 't', then that's a terminal symbol, and the string must match the sequences of these terminals as derived from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT23 can produce 't49' directly. But in our string, we have 't23' which doesn't match 't49'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Or perhaps 't23' is an abbreviation, but I suspect it's a terminal symbol. So I need to find which non-terminals can produce 't23'.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, there are lines like NT23 \u2192 't49', but I don't see any that produce 't23' directly. So maybe 't23' is not a terminal in this grammar. But that can't be, because the string has 't23', so it must be a terminal. Therefore, perhaps there's a production that I missed or misrepresented.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Looking through, I see:\n\nNT23 can be produced as NT5 NT20, or other combinations, but it eventually resolves to 't49' via NT5 \u2192 't26' and so on. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me see:\n\nLooking again, NT23's productions are:\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT23 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n\nWait, that's not matching. Wait, from the grammar provided, each 'NTxx' is a non-terminal and their productions are combinations of other NTxx or terminal strings. But looking at the last few lines, there's:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49'\n\nAh! So one of the productions for NT23 is NT23 \u2192 't49'. So 't49' is a terminal. So 't23' is a terminal symbol, meaning that there's a non-terminal that directly produces it.\n\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. The user provided the grammar as a list of lines like \"S -> NT23 NT24\", etc., and in other lines, I see things like \"NT21 \u2192 't21'\". So the grammar includes some non-terminals that directly produce terminal symbols, e.g., 't21', 't49', etc.\n\nThus, in this case, 't23' must be produced by a non-terminal NT23 \u2192 't23', but in the given grammar, I don't see that. Instead, looking through, I see NT23 \u2192 't49' and other NTxx \u2192 'txt' where t is some number. But I don't see any production for NT23 \u2192 't23'. So that suggests that 't23' is not a terminal in the language because no non-terminal produces it directly.\n\nBut that can't be right because the string has 't23', which must be part of the language. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the tokens like 't23' are actually abbreviations for larger structures, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Let me re-express the grammar rules properly. Each line is of the form Non-terminal -> option, where each option is either a combination of non-terminals or a terminal string (like 't49').\n\nLooking through the provided grammar again, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT20\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT23 \u2192 NT9 NT4\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT1\n- NT23 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n- Also, in the bottom part, line by line, I see:\n\nLine 58: NT23 \u2192 't49'\n\nWait, so yes, NT23 \u2192 't49' is one of the productions. So NT23 can produce 't49' directly. But then where does 't23' come from? Because the string includes 't23', which must be a terminal produced by some NT23', but the grammar doesn't produce 't23', only 't49' from NT23.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check each line carefully. Are there any productions where a non-terminal directly produces 't23'?\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't49' (line 58)\n- Other lines: NT21 \u2192 't21', NT22 \u2192 't28', etc.\n\nI don't see any production that produces 't23' directly. So if the string has 't23', then perhaps it's generated from an NT23 that somehow produces 't23'. But the grammar only has 't49' from NT23.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, are there any other NTx that produce 't23'? For example, perhaps NT6 \u2192 't23'?\n\nLooking through the grammar again, in line 15: NT6 \u2192 NT11 NT14.\n\nWait, but there's no direct production for NT6 \u2192 't23'. So unless it's through some chain, but that's unlikely because in the given string, 't23' is the first symbol.\n\nSo perhaps the string is not in the language because 't23' can't be generated by any non-terminal, meaning the grammar can't derive a string starting with 't23'. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down in such a way that non-terminals are used to derive the correct sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the entire string cannot be derived because 't23' is not in the terminal symbols. In that case, the string would not be generated, so the answer is No.\n\nWait, but that's contradictory to the problem's context, which presents a string to evaluate, so it's either in the language or not. If the grammar cannot produce 't23', then the string isn't in the language.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce several combinations of NTs, like NT23 NT5, NT20 NT16, etc. The NTs eventually resolve to terminals, but looking at the grammar, some of the rules seem to go directly to 't' followed by a number, like 't49' or 't50', which might be the actual terminals in the language. However, many rules are still non-terminals because they can further expand into other NTs or are even recursive.\n\nLet me list some of the NTs and see where they lead:\n\n- S -> NT23 NT5\n- Each NT production seems to lead to other NTs until they hit a rule that goes directly to 't' and a number. For example, NT19 -> NT29 NT29, and then looking further, NT29 seems to eventually produce 't29' somewhere, but in the given grammar, NT23 has a rule NT23 -> 't49' (the first occurrence at the bottom of the grammar: NT23 -> 't49'). Wait, actually, in the last part of the grammar after a bunch of non-terminals, there's NT23 -> 't49'. So that means NT23 can produce 't49', but also from earlier rules like NT23 -> NT9 NT4, which expand further.\n\nWait, no, I think I miscounted. Let me check the structure again. Starting from the top, each rule is of the form NT(...) -> NT(...) NT(...). The bottom of the grammar lists some NTs that directly produce a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT23 -> 't49', which is a terminal. Similarly, other NTs like NT19, NT20, etc., eventually produce 't' followed by some number.\n\nSo the strategy would be to parse the given string using the grammar, trying to match the sequence step by step. Each step involves expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t78 t92 t94 t78 t62 t59 t69 t69 t59 t49 t78 t59 t59 t49`.\n\nFirst, I notice that all symbols in the string are terminals of the form 't' followed by a number. So, I need to see how these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nEach non-terminal can produce a sequence of two NTs, which themselves might produce more NTs or directly 't's. Since the string is a concatenation of terminals, each 't' must be the result of a terminal production.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, not all NTs produce a terminal directly. Some NTs are non-terminals that produce other NTs until they resolve to a 't...'. For example, NT23 can produce 't49' directly or via other paths, but for the purpose of matching the string, perhaps certain NTs are more likely to produce certain 't's.\n\nBut to approach this, I think I need to figure out which NTs can produce the given 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the string sequence:\n\n1. t78\n2. t92\n3. t94\n4. t78\n5. t62\n6. t59\n7. t69\n8. t69\n9. t59\n10. t49\n11. t78\n12. t59\n13. t59\n14. t49\n\nSo, each 't' must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually resolves to it.\n\nLet me check which NTs produce 't's.\n\nFrom the bottom of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT26 -> 't23' (but wait, NT26 can't produce 't23', that's another NT. Wait, perhaps 't23' is an error in the grammar, or maybe it's a typo. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> NT24 NT6\nNT8 -> NT1 NT28\nNT28 -> NT20 NT18\nNT23 -> NT9 NT4\nNT19 -> NT29 NT29\nNT29 -> NT29 NT30\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\nNT9 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT19\nNT20 -> NT26 NT30\nNT18 -> NT10 NT26\nNT27 -> NT4 NT26\nNT17 -> NT19 NT2\nNT16 -> NT59, which is probably a typo since 't59' doesn't match the t format.\n\nWait, perhaps 't59' is a typo, and it should be 't59' or maybe it was meant to be 't59' as a terminal, but in the given grammar, NT16 -> 't59' is present?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking carefully through the grammar entries, some are given as 't' followed by a number. For instance, NT23 -> 't49', NT19 -> 't50', etc.\n\nWait, I think I see some that directly produce 't' followed by a number:\n\nFrom the given grammar, after a long list of non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT21 -> 't21'\n- NT8 -> 't91'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT11 -> 't18'\n- NT2 -> 't62'\n\nWait, so some of these NTs do directly produce 't' followed by a number:\n\n- NT23 -> 't49'\n- NT15 -> 't50'\n- NT2 -> 't47'\n- NT28 -> 't80'\n- NT24 -> 't1'\n- NT5 -> 't26'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT30 -> 't29'\n- NT7 -> 't82'\n- NT26 -> 't69'\n- NT30 -> 't86'\n- NT15 -> 't74'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT16 -> 't59'\n- NT9 -> 't78'\n- NT11 -> 't18'\n- NT2 -> 't62'\n\nSo, in the string, we have 't78', 't92', 't94', 't78', 't62', 't59', 't69', 't69', 't59', 't49', 't78', 't59', 't59', 't49'.\n\nLooking at which of these are directly produced by NTs in the grammar:\n\n- 't78': produced by NT9\n- 't92': Hmm, I don't see any NT producing 't92' directly. Let me check again. Looking through all the 't' rules, I don't see 't92'. So that's a red flag. If the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces 't92', then 't92' cannot be a terminal in the language, which suggests that the given string might not be in the language. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar, I see that no NT directly produces 't92'. The closest is 't23' or 't80', but not 't92'.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the NTs eventually produces 't92' via a chain.

I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar.

Looking at the production rules:\n\n- The start symbol is S.\n- S directly expands to combinations of NT followed by numbers, like NT23 NT5, NT20 NT16, etc. Each NT seems to be a non-terminal that eventually leads to terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n- The terminals seem to end with 't' and a digit, like t42, t50, etc. I notice that some NTs directly produce single terminals ending with t.\n\nThe given string is: `t42 t50 t78 t18 t78 t82 t92 t74 t28 t49 t92 t59 t26 t94 t82 t21 t49`\n\nI notice that the string has 17 elements, so the parse tree must have 16 internal nodes. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's likely that each non-terminal expands into two symbols, so we can model this as a binary tree.\n\nLet me try to map the string back to the possible structure. The first symbols are t42 and t50. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT23 can produce t5 and 4. Wait, that might not be directly matching. Wait, the production for NT23 could be looking back to see if t42 and t50 can come from it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S expands to NT23 and NT5, as one of the options. Let's see: S -> NT23 NT5. So, the first two symbols in the string must be coming from NT23 and NT5. \n\nLooking at NT5's production: from the grammar, I don't see an explicit production for NT5, but wait, maybe NT5 can't produce anything else. Wait no, all non-terminals expand to terminals or other non-terminals. Let me check the productions carefully.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT5 is used as S -> NT23 NT5.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps it's better to build a parse tree for the string, starting from the start symbol S and working our way down. Since S can expand to several options, let's see which production could lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the possible expansions:\n\n1. S could expand to NT23 NT5. Let's see if NT23 and NT5 can match the string. The start is t42 t50. Let's look for a production of NT23 that starts with t42.

So if S expands to NT23 NT5, then each part would follow their own productions.\n\nSo NT23 would need to produce t42, and NT5 would need to produce t50. But looking through the productions of NT5, I don't see any that produce terminals starting with t50. Wait, maybe NT5 is being further expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps S is not expanding to NT23 NT5. Let me check all S productions:\n\nThe S rules are:\n\n1. S -> NT23 NT24\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can expand in five different ways. The first option is S \u2192 NT23 NT24. Let's consider if that could lead to our string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t42 t50. If it starts with NT23, then NT23's expansion must start with t42.\n\nLooking for a rule where an NT can directly produce t42. Let me see the rules. Wait the rule NT24 -> NT5 NT19, NT21 -> NT10 NT9, etc. Wait, I don't see any NT directly producing t42.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another S expansion. Let's try S -> NT20 NT16. The string starts with t42 t50, so maybe NT20 is producing t42 and NT16 is producing t50.\n\nLooking into the rules for NT20:\n\nNT20's productions:\n\n- NT20 -> NT28 NT0\n\nSo that leads to two symbols, but in the string, the first part is t42 t50, so let me check if t42 can come from NG20.\n\nWait, looking for NT20 that produce terms that can generate t42. Let's see:\n\nNT20 can expand to NT28 NT0. Then NT28 can expand further. But I don't see any rules where NT28 or NT20 produce t42 directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT20 can produce t42 through some chain. Let me see: NT28 is NT20 -> NT28 NT0. So maybe NT28 can produce t42.

{"custom_id":"request-304","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar (CFG) given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine whether the string `t59 t29 t50 t94 t26 t94 t28 t91 t59 t59 t18 t69 t59 t29 t18 t49 t18` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Oh right, that's correct. So either the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see some rules with terminals on the right side, like `NT27 -> 't49'`, `NT15 -> 't50'`, etc. So these must be the leaves in the parse trees. The goal is to see if the input string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string to check is: `t59 t29 t50 t94 t26 t94 t28 t91 t59 t59 t18 t69 t59 t29 t18 t49 t18`. Let me count the tokens: there are 18 of them. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So a string of length 18 would require 17 productions (since each production increases the length by one starting from 1). Wait, actually, each production in a derivation for CNF will replace one symbol with two symbols, so the length doubles. But wait, in CNF, each rule adds one symbol, so the number of symbols doubles each time. So to reach a string of n symbols starting from one symbol, we need n-1 steps. So for a string of length 18, we'd need 17 productions. But the input is a string of 18 terminals, so perhaps I need to parse it.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to parse the string step by step to see if it can be derived from S. Let me list the string again:\n\nt59, t29, t50, t94, t26, t94, t28, t91, t59, t59, t18, t69, t59, t29, t18, t49, t18.\n\nWait, maybe I can look for the top-level productions that start with terminals. Let me look at the start symbol S and see what S\u2192 rules are available.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can produce either two non-terminals. The string starts with t59, which is a terminal. So I need to see if any of S's productions can lead to a string starting with t59.\n\nLooking at S's immediate children in the productions:\n\nEach S produces two non-terminals. So for example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24 would mean that NT23 and NT24 are both part of the derivation.\n\nBut t59 is a terminal. So perhaps one of NT23 or NT24 is a terminal, but looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT23: I see multiple productions, such as NT23 -> NT5 NT2, etc. I don't see any rule where NT23 is directly mapped to a terminal. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, etc. So neither NT23 nor NT24 directly produce t59. Hmm, so that's a problem. Because S's first production would give us two non-terminals, but the first token is a terminal, which doesn't match unless one of those non-terminals can produce a terminal. Wait, but in this case, the first symbol is t59, so unless one of NT23 or NT24 can produce t59, but I don't see that happening.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine NT23's productions. Looking back, I see NT23 -> NT5 NT2, NT23 -> NT6 NT9, etc. Oh, NT27 -> 't49', so it's a terminal. Does any NT have a production leading directly to t59? Looking through the rules, I see NT15 -> 't50', NT2 -> 't47', etc. Wait, does any NT directly produce t59? Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT17 -> 't59'. Oh, okay, NT17 can produce t59. So that means if in the derivation, somewhere we have a NT17, which can be a terminal. Now, looking back at S's productions, S has S-> NT17 NT3. So perhaps S can produce a t59 via NT17. So let me check that.\n\nSo S can produce NT17 NT3. Then, if NT17 is t59, we can have t59 followed by what NT3 produces.\n\nSo let's explore that. Let's consider the first step: S \u2192 NT17 NT3.\n\nThen, the next symbols should be the expansion of NT3. Since the input string starts with t59, which is NT17's production to t59, the next symbol should be what NT3 expands to. Looking at the string, after t59 is t29. So, after t59, the next token is t29.\n\nSo we have NT3 must produce t29. Looking at NT3's productions: Looking at the given productions, I see NT3 has several rules, such as NT3 -> NT2 NT25, NT3 -> NT4 NT0, etc. None of these directly produce a terminal, except perhaps if any NT eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me see if NT3 can eventually produce a terminal. For example, NT3 can go through several steps. Let's see: NT3 can produce NT4 NT0, and then if either NT4 or NT0 can reach a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11, NT4 \u2192 NT15 NT26. So NT4 is two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 \u2192 NT27 NT11, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT28, etc.\n\nHmm, it's getting complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT23 NT24, leading to t59 as part of the expansion of NT23 or NT24.\n\nWait, if S \u2192 NT23 NT24, and then NT23 can produce t59 via one of its rules? Wait no, because in the given rules, NT23's only terminals are via other non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check NT23's rules again:\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 -> NT5 NT25,\n\nNT27 -> 't49',\n\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9,\n\nothers like NT19, etc., but no NT23 directly produces t59.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT17 could produce t59, but in S's productions, S can produce NT17 NT3. So let's go back to that.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT3, producing t59 followed by what NT3 can produce. If NT3 can produce t29, then the next token is t29. Let me see if there's a way for NT3 to produce t29.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT2 NT25,\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT0,\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT26,\n\nNT3 -> NT21 NT2,\n\nNT3 -> NT12 NT26,\n\nNT3 -> NT22 NT7,\n\nNT3 -> NT23 NT25,\n\nNT3 -> NT4 NT29,\n\nWait, wait here: looking for NT3 \u2192 something that can produce t29. Wait, no NT's directly produce t29 except perhaps if they expand into non-terminals that can produce t29.\n\nLooking for NT29: NT29's rules include NT29 -> NT28 NT30, etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to backtrack. Let's try to see if the string can be parsed. Alternatively, perhaps the string has multiple t59s, which can come from a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nWait, the string starts with t59, followed by t29, t50, t94, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's look at S's other productions.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT20 NT16: Then t59 wouldn't fit, since NT20 \u2192 NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string given is: `t69 t1 t74 t49 t18 t21 t59 t59 t74 t62 t29 t49 t18 t18 t92 t59 t28 t59`. That's quite a long string with 19 tokens, which correspond to various non-terminals and terminals, I think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, meaning each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking through some of the rules, some have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9 NT4. So maybe it's not strictly CNF? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, Chomsky normal form only allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so any production with more than two non-terminals on the RHS is not in CNF. Looking back, the grammar provided seems to have productions with two non-terminals, so perhaps it is in CNF. Or maybe there's a mix.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, most are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which is allowed in CNF. But some have three terms, like NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9 NT4. No, that can't be right because in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25 (two non-terminals)\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT1 (two non-terminals)\n\nNT15 -> NT8 NT24 (two)\n\nNT7 -> NT23 NT2 (two)\n\nNT1 -> NT0 NT3 (two)\n\nNT29 -> NT7 NT8 (two)\n\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9 (two)\n\nWait, no, looking at the full grammar, I see that some of the rules have three non-terminals, like NT23 \u2192 NT23 NT21, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, each side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So actually, all the rules are in CNF because each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the grammar is correctly in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string consists of identifiers: t69, t1, t74, t49, etc. I need to see if this string can be derived by the grammar. Essentially, I need to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string where each step of the derivation uses the productions in the grammar.\n\nBut S is the start symbol, and looking at the grammar, S can produce combinations like NT23 NT24, NT20 NT16, etc. From the rule S \u2192 NT23 NT24 NT20 NT16? Wait, no, no, looking at \"S -> NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5\" which is actually a long production. Wait, no, looking back, the rules are:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5? Wait no, in the grammar, it's written as:\n\nS -> NT23 NT24 NT20 NT5 ?\n\nWait, actually, looking again: The rules as given are all the forms A \u2192 BC, each with two non-terminals. So each rule has two non-terminals. Wait no, checking the provided rules again: every production is of the form X \u2192 A B, where A and B are non-terminals, except for some that have terminals, like S \u2192 NT23 NT24, etc. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all rules are of the form X \u2192 A B, with A and B being non-terminals, except some that are just terminals, like NT7 -> 't82', etc. But NT is a non-terminal, so those are terminals.\n\nWait, the given grammar seems to have some rules that directly map to terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't82'. So the string can include these terminals along with non-terminals.\n\nOur string is entirely composed of 't' followed by numbers, so it's composed of terminals. So the derivation must use productions that lead to exactly these terminals as the symbols.\n\nTo map this, we can think of the grammar as a parse tree where each non-terminal at the leaves corresponds to a terminal in the string, and the structure of the tree must match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a top-down parsing approach or the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, that might be time-consuming.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see some rules end with -> t, where t is a terminal. That's a bit confusing because Chomsky Normal Form doesn't include terminals on the left side. Wait, maybe this grammar is in a slightly different form, or perhaps it's a mix. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules are non-terminals transforming into two non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT24 NT24 or S \u2192 NT20 NT16. But then there are some rules that directly go to terminals, like NT7 \u2192 't49' or NT15 \u2192 't50'. Hmm, so it's a context-free grammar, but not exactly in Chomsky Normal Form since some rules produce terminals directly. Maybe it's in a different form, or perhaps the user made a mistake. But for now, I'll proceed with the understanding that the grammar includes both two-step productions and direct terminal outputs.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t50 t92 t59 t82 t26 t69 t59 t86 t18 t28 t28 t23 t59 t86 t82 t92 t59 t26.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals, I should probably start analyzing the string from the right, like a reverse derivation, to see if it can be broken down using the given production rules.\n\nLet me list the string with positions for clarity:\n\n1. t50\n2. t92\n3. t59\n4. t82\n5. t26\n6. t69\n7. t59\n8. t86\n9. t18\n10. t28\n11. t28\n12. t23\n13. t59\n14. t86\n15. t82\n16. t92\n17. t59\n18. t26\n\nSo, starting from the latter end, let's see the last part of the string. The last token is t26. Looking at the grammar, which direct rules produce t26? Looking through all the 't' rules, I find:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, I'm seeing rules like NT2 \u2192 't47', but I need to find if any non-terminal directly produces 't26'. Scanning through, I see:\n\nLooking at the given NT rules, I don't immediately spot a production rule for 't26'. Wait, let me check each line where it ends with -> t.\n\nLooking at the start of the \"Here\" part:\n\nLine 19: NT15 \u2192 't50'\n\nLine 20: NT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nLine 34: NT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nLine 36: NT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, that line says NT26 \u2192 't23'? Or wait, line 36: looking back, the \"Here\" section:\n\nLine 36: NT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nLine 37: NT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, so NT5 directly produces 't26'. So t26 is produced by NT5.\n\nSo the last token, t26, comes from NT5. So before that, in the derivation, there must be a rule that produces t26 and then something else. Let me see.\n\nSince in the grammar, the only rule producing t26 is NT5 \u2192 t26. So the last part of the string is 't26', but in the grammar, that's just a terminal, so in the derivation, it's just 't26' at the end. But when deriving, we start from the start symbol and expand. So to have 't26' as the last symbol, the entire derivation must end with expanding a non-terminal that directly goes to 't26'.\n\nWait, but in the provided string, the last symbol is t26, so in the derivation, it must be the last non-terminal step. Let's try to reverse engineer.\n\nSo the last token is t26, coming from NT5. So before that, the string must have been something that ends with the production rule that leads to NT5 and t26. But wait, in the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't26' is a production. So perhaps the last symbol in the string is the result of NT5 being expanded without any further non-terminals, which would be possible only if NT5 is the last symbol. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the string ends with t26, so the derivation path would be something like A \u2192 ... \u2192 t26, but in that case, how?\n\nWait, in typical derivations, you start from S and expand to more symbols, until all are terminals. So the last symbol in the string is the result of expanding a single non-terminal into a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT5 \u2192 't26' is a production. So if in the derivation, we have a string ending with t26, that would imply that the last step is NT5 being expanded into t26. So the string's last part must be exactly the expansion of NT5. So the last symbol of the string is t26, which comes from NT5.\n\nSo, looking at the given string, the last symbol is t26, so that would have to come from NT5. Now, the preceding symbol is t82. So in the derivation, perhaps the context around it is NT5 \u2192 ... and then t26 is the last symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT5's production rules include NT5 \u2192 't26' and maybe others. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' on line NT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nAre there any other rules for NT5? Let me scan:\n\nLines 5: NT4 \u2192 ..., line 10: NT5 \u2192 't26', line 24: NT26 \u2192 't23', etc. So NT5 only has the terminal rule NT5 \u2192 't26'.\n\nHmm, so NT5 only goes to 't26' directly. So if the last symbol is t26, then before that, in the derivation, I must have a production that produces NT5, ending with 't26'. But NT5 can't be part of any larger production except when it's a result of another non-terminal expanding into it.\n\nWait, but in the given string, after t82 comes t26. So the production rule for the part before t26 must end with NT5, which goes to t26. This seems only possible if that part is something that reduces to NT5. But looking at the grammar, is there any rule that produces NT5 as the immediate left-hand side? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the non-terminals seem to have production rules that sometimes produce other non-terminals. For example, NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT22, etc. So perhaps there's a rule where a non-terminal A produces NT5 as one of its parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a rule where a non-terminal A expands to something that includes NT5 as the last part. For example, A \u2192 ... NT5. But looking through, I don't see any NT5 in the middle of any production, except perhaps in other non-terminals.\n\nWait, for example, looking at line 21: NT21 \u2192 NT10 NT9. So if part of the string includes 't82 t26', perhaps the NT5 is at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string can be derived starting from S, which expands into various non-terminals that eventually expand into the given terminals. This might require a complex step-by-step breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to break the string into possible non-terminals and see if each part can be derived.\n\nLet me start from the end and work backward.\n\nThe last symbol is t26 \u2192 must come from NT5. So before that, there must be a symbol that, when expanded, leads to NT5 and then t26. But since NT5 only has the rule \u2192 't26', then in the derivation, that part is just the last symbol, meaning that before NT5, there must be another non-terminal that, when expanded, produces that NT5 as the next step.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbol before t26 is t82. So in the string, after t82 comes t26. So perhaps 't82 t26' is part of a production A \u2192 NTsomething where NTsomething \u2192 't82 t26'. Let me check whether any non-terminal produces 't82 t26'.\n\nLooking through the 't' rules"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit that form because all the production rules are of the form NT \u2192 TT or NT \u2192 T, where T stands for terminals and NT for non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of symbols, mostly t's followed by numbers, except for some t's at the start. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S following the given rules.\n\nThe first step is to look at the possible terminals in the grammar. The terminals are represented by t followed by numbers, like t78, t82, etc. So, any symbol in the string that doesn't appear in the production rules must be a terminal. I can check the grammar to see which numbers correspond to terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT7 produces 't82' according to the rule NT7 \u2192 't82'. Similarly, other rules have terminals like 't49', 't59', 't18', etc. But not all terminals are covered in the grammar. For instance, I notice that in the production rules, some NT30 produce 't80' and 't86'.

Looking back, the grammar is written in a way that some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't74' (so 't74' is a terminal)\n- NT2 \u2192 't94' (so 't94' is a terminal)\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (so 't26' is a terminal)\n- NT22 \u2192 't62' (so 't62' is a terminal)\n\nBut elsewhere, non-terminals produce other non-terminals. For instance, NT30 is defined with several rules, some of which produce terminals like 't80' (e.g., NT30 \u2192 NT30 NT6, but another rule is NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which then may produce 't78' etc.)\n\nWait, actually, each production in the grammar is written as NTa \u2192 NTb NTc or NTa \u2192 't'xx, where 't'xx is a terminal. So for example, NT30 \u2192 NT30 NT6 is a production, so NT30 can produce two non-terminals, and another production could produce a terminal like 't80'.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, I can see that NT30 has several rules, some of which produce a combination of non-terminals, and one production is NT30 \u2192 't80' perhaps? Let me check each NT30 production.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1 (non-terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22 (non-terminals, unless any of NT10 or NT22 produce terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT10 NT22 again.\n- NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT8 (NT22 is a non-terminal, but NT8 is... wait, does NT8 exist? Looking through the rules, I don't see NT8 as a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal, but in the initial list, NT8 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, looking through the rules, some RHS have 't' followed by a number. For example, NT27 \u2192 't2 NT23', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol, while others produce two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals produce a terminal.

Wait, more carefully:\n\nLooking for any RHS where it's just 't' plus a number, for example:\n\n- Line 25: NT7 \u2192 't82'\n- Line 34: NT1 \u2192 't94'\n- Line 30: NT28 \u2192 't18'\nWait, no: looking at the rules provided, let me check:\n\nAh, here's a rule: NT19 \u2192 't6 NT27'? No, actually, in the initial data, one rule is NT19 \u2192 't'62 (I think not), let me scan through.\n\nWait, perhaps some rules are written as 't8', 't9', etc. \n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nLine 30: NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2.\n\nLine ? : NT15 \u2192 't74'\n\nLine ? : NT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nLine ? : NT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nLine ? : NT23 \u2192 't20 NT4'\n\nWait, no.

The string is: `t1 t92 t59 t1 t26 t94 t28 t49 t49 t82 t91 t50 t92 t59 t94 t49 t28 t28`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice there are a lot of productions starting with NT and some that directly produce terminals like 't'. For example, NT22 \u2192 NT7 NT8, and I see that NT7 is producing 't82', and NT8 is producing 't62' (but wait, checking the grammar, some NT23 productions have 't49', but others have NT7 and NT22, etc.).\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar step by step. Let's list all the productions that produce terminals because those will help in checking the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT19 \u2192 let's see what NT6 and NT19 produce. NT6 has a production \u2192 NT17 NT3, then NT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25. NT2 has \u2192 NT25 NT19, which is getting a bit complex. Hmm, maybe some terminals are produced at the leaves.\n\nWait, the string contains 't1', 't92', 't59', etc. So I need to check which NT symbols produce these 't' strings.\n\nLooking deeper into the grammar, some NT productions directly yield 't' followed by numbers, like:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, actually, after checking, the 't's are specific.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\nLooking again:\n\nI see lines like:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16 \u2192 but NT16 \u2192 't59'\n- NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 't1', NT19 \u2192 something\n- NT4 \u2192 NT18 NT15, which leads to 't50' and 't74'\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, which both have 't's\n- NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT19, which leads to 't28' (since NT22 \u2192 NT7 NT8, NT7 \u2192 't82', NT8 \u2192 't92')\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to identify all the non-terminals that eventually produce 't's and what those 't's are.\n\nFirst, let's list all the terminal symbols in the string. The string is:\n\nt1, t92, t59, t1, t26, t94, t28, t49, t49, t82, t91, t50, t92, t59, t94, t49, t28, t28.\n\nThese are the actual terminals we're seeing. So I need to see if each of these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by mapping each 't' in the string to a production in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice a few NT productions that directly produce 't' followed by a number:\n\nWait, no, actually, let's re-examine the grammar provided. It seems some parts have 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't28' (check the grammar)\nWait, in the grammar, looking at lines:\n\nAh, here's a line:\nNT22 \u2192 NT28 NT0 \u2192 and looking at NT28, which has a production NT28 \u2192 NT23 NT9, etc., so it might not directly produce 't's.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the NT27 \u2192 't49' and NT23 \u2192 't49' via NT27? Let me look at the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, there is a line: NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16, and NT16 \u2192 't59'. So NT23 produces t59 along with NT27. Then, what does NT27 produce? Oh, here's a line: NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26. Hmm, not a terminal yet.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see lines like NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26, which doesn't directly produce a 't'. Then, what about NT4? NT4 \u2192 NT18 NT15, which both might produce 't's.\n\nLooking for all instances where an NT production is followed by 't' and a number. Let me go through each line:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT15 NT8: does this produce a 't'? Let's see NT15 \u2192 NT2 NT8, which then NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT19. Not seeing 't' here.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT18 NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT2 NT8 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT19. Not a 't'.\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30: NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26 or other, but let's see specific 't's.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NT symbols that directly produce 't's. Scanning through the lines:\n\nI see lines like NT22 \u2192 't28', but no, NT22 \u2192 NT28 NT0, which doesn't produce 't28'. Wait, perhaps in the grammar, there are symbols that produce 't' immediately. For example:\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT19: NT22 \u2192 NT7 NT8, and NT8 \u2192 't92' (Wait, I think earlier I thought NT8 \u2192 't92'?

Let me scan each line:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT27 NT16 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 't59', so NT23 produces 't59' along with NT27, but NT27 is another NT.\n\n- NT16 \u2192 't59' (so if any production leads to NT16, it adds 't59' to the string).\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30: Both NT26 and NT30 have 't's.\n\nWait, let's check NT26:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT26 has productions like NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26, NT26 \u2192 NT12 NT7, etc. Hmm, not a 't'.\n\nBut wait, in one line, NT26 \u2192 NT7 NT29, and then NT29 \u2192 NT29 NT30. Wait, not helping. Oh, but perhaps in other productions.\n\nWait, looking for any NT -> 't' followed by a number:\n\nWait, I see that NT27 \u2192 't49' is produced when some other NT produces it.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to look for all NT productions that directly produce 't' symbols.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing a terminal with a number. Instead, it seems all NT productions are two non-terminals, except for some lines like:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6 \u2192 but NT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19, which then NT5 \u2192 't1', and NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29, which then NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT8, so NT29 produces 't's as well.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe instead of trying to map each 't', I can approach this by trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree for the string. But given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to see if all the terminals in the string are covered by the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut first, let me list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt1, t92, t59, t1, t26, t94, t28, t49, t49, t82, t91, t50, t92, t59, t94, t49, t28, t28.\n\nSo, each of these is a terminal symbol. I need to check if the grammar can produce these through its productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see that some terminals are produced by NT16 \u2192 't59', NT27 \u2192 't49', and NT10 \u2192 't92' perhaps.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT19. Let's see what NT22 and NT19 produce.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t78 t28 t62 t59 t59 t74 t29 t18 t47 t18 t92 t42 t59 t59 t28 t49 t91 t69 t28 t26`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit this structure since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals and the right-hand sides consist of two non-terminals or a mix with terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals expand into terminals, like NT7 \u2192 't82', which tells me that the only terminals are 't's with numbers, and I need to generate a string consisting of these 't's.\n\nThe string given has 20 tokens. I need to see if each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, but wait, some of the non-terminals might require more than one step to reach the terminals. The process involves replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals until we end up with only terminals. I'll need to build a parse tree for the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, which is in CNF, each production is a rule that can be applied in any order. The initial string S \u2192 NT24 NT24 or others. But looking at the string, the last token is t26. Looking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 't23', but 't23' isn't in the string. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has rules where NT's resolve to 't's eventually. Let me check each rule. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT25 NT2, NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT2 \u2192 NT15 NT9, and so on. It seems that eventually, these resolve into 't's. For example, NT9 \u2192 't78', NT2 \u2192 't94', NT5 \u2192 't26', etc.\n\nSo, to parse the given string, I need to see if each terminal in it matches a derived terminal from the grammar. Let me list the terminals in the string: t78, t28, t62, t59, t59, t74, t29, t18, t47, t18, t92, t42, t59, t59, t28, t49, t91, t69, t28, t26.\n\nLet me check each one:\n\nt78: Looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't78', so NT9 can produce t78.\n\nt28: NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11 \u2192 NT30 \u2192 NT9 NT7 \u2192 NT9 \u2192 t78, NT7 \u2192 t82. Wait, but in the grammar, NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, and NT10 \u2192 NT18 NT9, but wait, this might take multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step, but that could be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if each token in the string is covered by the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, but some of the 't's in the string might correspond to multiple non-terminals. For example, t78 is from NT9, t92 is NT18, t42 is NT16, etc.\n\nBut maybe I can traverse the grammar to see if all these 't's are covered. Let me see:\n\n- t78 is present as NT9 \u2192 't78'\n- t28 is present as NT25 \u2192 't28' (since NT25 \u2192 't28' based on the grammar? Let me check the given productions. Wait, looking back, the grammar has a rule NT26 \u2192 't23', but I'm looking for where 't28' comes from. Looking at the given, yes, there is a rule NT25 \u2192 't28'. So NT25 can produce t28.\n\n- t62: Looking at the grammar, is there 't62'? Not directly, but perhaps NT25 \u2192 't28', but 't62' isn't listed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The given rules include NT25 \u2192 't28'. So maybe 't62' comes from NT4 \u2192 't62'? Wait, looking back, yes, the grammar includes NT4 \u2192 't62' as the last rule.\n\n- t59 appears twice.

Let me confirm:\n\nThe user provided the last lines:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't28'\n\nYes, so NT25 \u2192 t28.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 't1' (but 't1' isn't a terminal, so that must be part of a larger expansion. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, no. The rule is NTT24 \u2192 't1'? That can't be, because 't1' is a terminal. Or perhaps it's a typo, and 't1' is a non-terminal, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, looking back, no, in the given rules, for example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't1' is not present. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94' \n\nNT5 \u2192 't26' \n\nNT6 \u2192 't17' \n\nWait, let me list out all NT rules that have terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't19' \n\nWait, no, actually, in the given, multiple rules have terminals as the right-hand side. For example:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in the rules:\n\nLooking at the end of the provided rules:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't28' \n\nSo, NT25 can produce 't28'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all the NT which directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't82'\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't49'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't17'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't78'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, but that's not useful because 't1' is a terminal. So, any NT that can produce 't1' must expand into it. But in the grammar, 't1' is a terminal, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the string has t28 twice, t59 twice, t74, t62, etc. So"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-355","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t59 t29 t18 t94 t47 t92 t59 t26 t47 t59 t59 t18 t92 t59 t18 t29 t49 t50 t62 t28` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the approach to solving this problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar has multiple production rules starting with S. Each production rule splits S into two non-terminal symbols (NT). For example, S -> NT24 NT24 or S -> NT20 NT16, etc. Each of these NT symbols can further produce another pair of NT symbols or sometimes a terminal string (denoted by t followed by a number). For instance, some NT symbols end with 't49', 't50', or are directly 't...' up to 't94' and beyond.\n\nThe string we're evaluating starts with `t59 t29 t18...`. Since the string starts with t59, let's see which production rules end with t59. Looking through the production rules, I notice:\n\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT17 -> 't19 nt2' \u2014 wait, no, that's actually a production that includes a terminal, but I'm not sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, scanning the rules, I see NT20 -> t97, which is a terminal. Also, NT17 has a production NT17 -> NT19 NT2, but that doesn't seem relevant here because it doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nSo, t59 is produced by NT16. So, the first step is S -> NT16 NTsomething, but looking at the production rules, I don't see S directly producing NT16 followed by NTsomething except maybe in certain combinations. Wait, S's production rules are each a pair, so for example, one rule is S -> NT24 NT24. So, S must split into two NTs. Let me check all S rules:\n\nS -> NT24 NT24\nS -> NT20 NT16\nS -> NT17 NT3\nS -> NT20 NT6\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, looking at these, each starts with S -> NT... NT... So, for the string to start with S, the first two tokens must match the right-hand side of a production rule. The first token in the string is t59, so let's see which production rules produce t59 as the first element. Looking at the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT16 -> t59\n- Are there any other NT productions that start with t59? No, I think that's the only one. So the first production must be S -> NT20 NT16 because S has a rule that includes NT20 and NT16. Wait no, actually S -> NT20 NT16 means that NT20 and NT16 are the two non-terminals that S can produce. Wait, but earlier I thought t59 is produced by NT16. So S could produce NT20 and NT16 in that case.\n\nWait, no. S's production rules each generate a pair of non-terminals. So for the string to start with t59, it must be that the first NT is NT16, producing t59, and the second NT in the pair should produce something else, perhaps another t. Let's check the second token, which is t29.\n\nSo, after t59 comes t29. Let me see which production rules produce t29. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n- NT12 -> NT12 NT22\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT2 NT25\n- NT26 -> NT8 NT26\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t29. Hmm, perhaps t29 is produced by an NT that's further expanded. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier because some NTs produce t's with numbers larger than 30. Wait, looking again, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT17 -> 't19 nt2' \u2014 wait, that's actually NT17's production: NT17 -> NT19 NT2, but that doesn't end with a terminal. Then where does t29 come from?\n\nWait, let's look more carefully. Another rule is NT23 -> NT29 NT30. So, NT29 is a non-terminal that can produce t29 and another NT. Let me see. Let me list all NT rules that generate t's:\n\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT30 -> t29 (multiple times)\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25 (so doesn't produce a t directly)\n- NT27 -> t49? Wait, NT27 -> t49? I don't see that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice a production NT7 -> t82, NT15 -> t74, etc. Wait, actually, no, some seem to directly produce terminals. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT30 -> t29\n- NT23 -> NT5 NT25\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT2 -> t94\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t28\n- NT24 -> t1\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT4 -> t22\n- NT20 -> t97\n- NT18 -> t92\n- NT12 -> t29\n- NT26 -> t23\n- NT30 -> t29\n- NT7 -> t82\n- NT26 -> t69\n- NT30 -> t86\n- NT15 -> t74\n- NT24 -> t42\n- NT16 -> t59\n- NT9 -> t78\n- NT11 -> t18\n- NT2 -> t62\n\nWait, but it's possible that the string starts with NT16 (producing t59) followed by NT16 again? Because looking at the production rules, I don't see S directly using NT16 twice, but let me check the S rules again:\n\nS's rules are:\n\n1. S -> NT24 NT24\n2. S -> NT20 NT16\n3. S -> NT17 NT3\n4. S -> NT20 NT6\n5. S -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo, for the string to start with t59 (from NT16) and then t29, perhaps the second NT is NT20 producing t97, but t29 is a different token, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the second NT is NT30, which can produce t29.\n\nWait, NT30 has multiple productions, some of which produce terminals. For example, I see:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT1\n- NT30 -> NT7 NT8\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT30 -> NT30 NT30\n- NT30 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT30 -> NT22 NT6\n- NT30 -> NT23 NT9\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT27\n- NT30 -> NT29 NT29\n- NT30 -> NT10 NT22\n- NT30 -> NT27 NT11\n- NT30 -> NT15 NT0\n- etc.\n\nLooking for a production that leads to t29, I see NT30 can produce NT29 NT29, and then the children can produce terminals. Wait, let me see:\n\nNT29 can produce:\n\n- NT29 -> NT4 NT23\n- NT23 can lead to NT5, etc., but also NT29 can produce:\n\nWait, NT29 has a production NT29 -> NT29 NT30, but looking through, I don't see a production that directly produces a terminal from NT29. Therefore, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another rule is NT30 -> NT29 NT29. So, if after S -> NT16 NTsomething, and the second NTsomething is NT30, then from NT30 we can get t29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about how to parse the string step by step, possibly using a top-down approach since it's an S-based grammar.\n\nStarting with the string:\n\nt59 t29 t18 t94 t47 t9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is \"t94 t59 t59 t49 t18 t86 t62 t49 t59 t49 t62 t91 t78 t28 t59 t29 t18 t47 t91 t42 t91\". \n\nFirst, I notice that each \"t\" value seems to correspond to a terminal symbol. The grammar has a lot of NT terminals and non-terminals, like S, NT23, NT30, etc. Each production in the grammar produces either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, I need to parse the string step by step, following the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string: t94, t59, t59, t49, t18, t86, t62, t49, t59, t49, t62, t91, t78, t28, t59, t29, t18, t47, t91, t42, t91.\n\nI should start by looking for terminals that appear at the beginning. The first token is t94. Looking at the grammar, I see production NT2 -> t94. So, S can produce NT23 NT5, but I need to see where t94 appears. Checking the grammar, there's a production NT2 -> t94.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT23 has several productions like NT23 -> t74, etc., but I'm looking for t94. Let me scan through the grammar rules for NT23.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT2 -> t94\nSo, NT2 (which is a non-terminal) can produce t94. But in the initial productions, S generates NT23 NT5. So perhaps S starts by generating NT23 and NT5, and then those non-terminals can produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me see where t94 is used. It appears as the first token. So the first step is to see if the first part of the string corresponds to a production starting with t94. Since t94 is the first terminal, it suggests that the first step is using the production NT2 -> t94. But wait, S produces NT23 NT5 directly. So how do we get t94 as the first token?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol is S, but S can only produce specific pairs. Let me list all the initial productions:\n\nS can produce:\n- NT23 NT5\n- NT20 NT16\n- NT17 NT3\n- NT20 NT6\n- NT9 NT5\n\nSo S is non-terminal, and to get the first token t94, which is a terminal, we need a production that starts with t94. But the initial productions for S only produce non-terminals, unless those non-terminals can produce a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, most non-terminals produce other non-terminals except for some that go directly to terminals, like NT2 -> t94, etc.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The initial productions for S all are non-terminals paired. The non-terminals like NT23, NT30, etc., each have multiple productions, some of which are terminals.\n\nSo to get t94 as the first token, we must have a path where S starts by generating a non-terminal that can produce t94, but S itself only generates combinations of non-terminals. Therefore, the entire string must derive from S via a series of productions leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t94, which is derived from a non-terminal. So t94 must be the result of a production. Looking back, the grammar gives NT2 -> t94. So t94 is the production of NT2.\n\nBut S only directly produces pairs of non-terminals. So the first step is S -> ... some non-terminals. Let's look at the first token t94, which must come from NT2, which is the child of some NT.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string was generated via leftmost derivation. So let me consider that.\n\nStarting from S, which can produce NT23 NT5. Now, the first token is t94. So if the leftmost symbol is NT23, and if NT23 can produce t94, then that's a possibility.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT23 have a production that starts with t94? Let me check the productions for NT23:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 -> NT5 NT25\nNT23 -> NT6 NT9\nNT23 -> NT11 NT1\nNT23 -> NT20 NT4\nNT23 -> NT19 NT27\nNT19 -> NT29 NT29\nNT29 -> NT29 NT30\nNT30 -> NT9 NT7\netc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any production for NT23 that leads to t94. So perhaps S's first production is not NT23 NT5, but another one. Let me check other options.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The start symbol is S, and S produces NT23 NT5. But to get t94 as the first symbol, perhaps there's a way for NT23 to produce t94. But looking through the productions, I don't see any NT23 that leads directly to a terminal like t94.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is actually derived by multiple steps, and t94 comes from a deeper production. Let me check if any non-terminal NT23 can eventually produce t94. Let's see the productions for NT23:\n\nNT23 can go to NT5 NT25. Then NT5 has productions like NT5 -> NT15 NT8, and further down.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I should write a parser or use an approach to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t94, which is the result of NT2 -> t94, but that would require S to produce NT2 somewhere in its derivation. But S only produces NT23 and NT5 initially.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps the first token is t94, which is derived from NT2, but NT2 can only be produced from other non-terminals that eventually lead to t94. For example, checking NT2's productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's no production for NT2 in the initial list except if derived from elsewhere. Wait, checking the full grammar, I see:\n\nWait, for example, NT2 isn't directly listed, but perhaps through other productions. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I see a production NT2 -> t94. So NT2 is a non-terminal that directly produces t94.\n\nBut S doesn't have a production for NT2. S only directly produces NT23 NT5, and other combinations. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nSo for S to produce t94, which is NT2 -> t94, the first step would require that S somehow directly or indirectly leads to NT2. But S's initial productions are NT23 NT5 and other combinations, which don't directly produce NT2. So this means that the first token t94 cannot be derived from S unless there's a production that allows S to produce NT2 somehow, which I don't see.\n\nThis suggests that the string is not in the language because the first symbol t94 cannot be derived from S. But perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again to see if I missed any production for NT2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, no, there's no production for NT2 except perhaps indirectly via another non-terminal. For example, if there's a production for NT23 that leads to NT2, but I don't see that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is using a non-leftmost derivation, but the first symbol t94 comes from a non-terminal that is derived later in the string, which doesn't make sense in a Chomsky Normal Form parser since it's leftmost.\n\nHmm, so if S can't produce t94 as the first symbol, then the string isn't valid.

{"custom_id":"request-384","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is: `t28 t62 t59 t59 t91 t86 t62 t18 t69 t59 t78 t28 t47 t91 t78 t26 t21 t28 t28 t28 t18 t18`. \n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes certain algorithms, like the CYK parser, more efficient.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's mostly in CNF except for some rules that have length 2 on both sides, like the ones starting with S. For example, S \u2192 NT23 NT24, which is two non-terminals, is in CNF since each is on the right side. So, I think all production rules here are correctly in CNF.\n\nNow, the string provided seems to consist entirely of terminal symbols, but I need to check if they can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Each 't' followed by a number probably represents a terminal symbol, and the NTs are non-terminals. But looking at the grammar, most non-terminals (like NT23, NT30, etc.) seem to have productions that produce other non-terminals, except for some that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see some rules where non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) produce terminal strings. For example, NT23 \u2192 't49' and NT15 \u2192 't50', among others. Oh, but this seems a bit confusing. Some rules, like NT15 \u2192 't50' or NT23 \u2192 't49', directly produce terminals, while others like NT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 or NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1 produce non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string to evaluate doesn't include any terminal symbols beyond 't'... Let me check the original string again.\n\nThe string is: `t28 t62 t59 t59 t91 t86 t62 t18 t69 t59 t78 t28 t47 t91 t78 t26 t21 t28 t28 v t18 t18`. Wait, no, the initial instruction says: the string is `t28 t62 t59 t59 t91 t86 t62 t18 t69 t59 t78 t28 t47 t91 t78 t26 t21 t28 t28 t28 t18 t18`. So all are 't' followed by numbers, meaning all are terminal symbols.\n\nBut in the grammar, most non-terminals have productions that lead to other non-terminals, except some that go directly to terminals. So for a string composed solely of terminals to be derived from the start symbol, there must be a path of productions that consume all of them.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, the entire structure seems to be based on non-terminals that keep expanding without ever reaching terminals except for a few cases. For example, NT23 can go to 't49' or other NTs. But the problem is that the string to check doesn't include 't49', 't50', etc. So unless the string includes terminals that are products of the non-terminals, it might not be derivable.\n\nWait, no, in the given string, all the elements are 't28, t62, etc., down to 't18'. Let me check the grammar to see if any of these terminals are directly produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't49'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT21 \u2192 't21' (Wait, is that a terminal or a non-terminal? The grammar has `NT21 -> NT10 NT27 | NT28 NT24 | NT1 NT11 | NT28 NT7`. Hmm, wait, in the provided grammar, I see \"NT21 -> NT10 NT27 | NT28 NT24 | NT1 NT11 | NT28 NT7\"` \u2014 no, actually, all these non-terminals don't go directly to terminals. But the string includes 't21' as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar provided, here's a line: \"NT21 -> NT10 NT27 | NT28 NT24 | NT1 NT11 | NT28 NT7\". So NT21 is a non-terminal that can produce other NTs, but I don't see any production that leads directly to 't21'. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't91' is a terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking further, in the grammar, we have rules like NT2 \u2192 't94' and NT26 \u2192 't23', etc. So some non-terminals do produce terminals. So for the string in question, if the sequence of terminals can be produced by the grammar, then it's possible.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, check the start symbol: S \u2192 NT23 NT24, etc. So the first step is to have S \u2192 NT_a NT_b where each NT can be expanded. To produce a string made of terminals, all intermediate non-terminals must be consumed and replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the string starts with t28, which is a terminal. So to get t28, there must be a production where an NT (maybe a chain of productions) leads to t28.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT23 can go to 't49' or other NTs. So unless t49 is part of the string, or another path leads to t28, it won't matter.\n\nWait, but t28 is a terminal in the string. So we need to find a production path that can produce t28. Let's look: \n\nIn the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't80', and earlier, NT28 \u2192 't20 NT18' or other rules. But t80 is a terminal? Wait, no. Looking back at the grammar, the only NTs that have direct terminals are NT23 \u2192 't49', NT15 \u2192 't50', and a few others:\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49' | NT5 NT25\n\nNT30 \u2192 't80' | NT3 NT1\n\nNT4 \u2192 't26' | NT0 NT11\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nThe grammar lines include:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, no, in the original grammar, I think I may have misread. The lines are:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT5 NT25 | NT6 NT9 | 't49'\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24 | 't50'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't94'\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT10 NT27 | NT28 NT24 | 't21'\n\nWait, yes, in the initial lines, there are some NT rules that end with 't...'. So for example, NT23 can produce 't49', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT15 can produce 't50'. NT2 can produce 't94', and NT21 can produce 't21'.\n\nBut in the given string, I see 't28', 't62', etc. Let me check whether these correspond to any terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminal symbols in the grammar:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't49' | NT5 NT25\n\n- Terminals: t49\n\nNT30 \u2192 't80' | NT3 NT1\n\n- Terminals: t80\n\nNT15 \u2192 't50' | NT8 NT24\n\n- Terminals: t50\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2 | 't23' | 't82' | 't8'...

{"custom_id":"request-383","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t97 t92 t59 t42 t47 t28 t50 t78 t50 t29 t18 t62 t23 t59 t86 t18 t59 t59 t49 t59 t29 t18`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars use production rules to generate strings, and since this grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. In this case, the start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals ending with 't' followed by numbers. The terminals seem to be the tokens like 't97', 't92', etc. \n\nSo, I need to parse the string by matching the production rules. The string starts with 't97', so I should look for a production rule that ends with 't97'. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30, and NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26, NT27 \u2192 't49'. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be derived from the grammar. Let me list some of the production rules that produce certain terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT30\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT10 NT17\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\n- NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT12 \u2192 't29'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Each production rule that ends with certain non-terminals might lead to a terminal. For example, looking for the main string, I can try to split it into chunks that correspond to production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured as a series of non-overlapping productions. Let me try to group the string into segments where each segment corresponds to a production rule.\n\nThe string is quite long: 21 tokens. Let's count the number of steps. Each production in CNF produces two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, or two terminals. But in this case, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So, during leftmost derivation, we start with S and expand each non-terminal step by step.\n\nBut the string is in terms of terminals like 't97', so each terminal must correspond directly to a production that ends with that.\n\nLooking back, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals as their definition. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't94'\n- NT20 \u2192 't97'\n- NT18 \u2192 't92'\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT22 \u2192 't28'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT26 \u2192 't69' (Wait, but 't69' isn't in the string. Hmm. Or, perhaps looking for which terminals are in the string.)\n\nWait, the string has 't97', 't92', 't59', etc. So I should check if any non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' (Yes, NT20 can produce 't97')\n- NT18 \u2192 't92' (Yes)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9, which might lead to other terminals\n- NT27 \u2192 't49'\n- NT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29, which can lead to 't29's if those exist\n- NT30 \u2192 't29' or other terms\n- NT15 \u2192 't50'\n- NT5 \u2192 't26'\n- NT26 \u2192 't8 NT26' (Wait, 't8' followed by NT26?)\nWait, no\u2014looking again, some rules produce terminals. For example, NT27 \u2192 't49', so that might not be in the string. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't97' (Yes)\n- NT18 \u2192 't92' (Yes)\n- NT27 \u2192 't49' (Yes)\n- NT15 \u2192 't50' (Yes)\n- NT22 \u2192 't28' (Yes)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1' (Yes)\n- NT2 \u2192 't94' (Yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 't26' (Yes)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26. Wait, so NT26 produces a non-terminal followed by another non-terminal, which would require further expansion.\n- NT23 \u2192 NT6 NT9. So, it expands into two non-terminals.\n- NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11, which are non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nAlso, the string has tokens like 't59', 't47', etc. So I need to see if any of the non-terminals produce these.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which might lead to other terms, but I don't see a rule that leads to 't59' directly.\n- NT5 \u2192 't26', which could be part of a longer expansion.\n- NT20 \u2192 NT26 NT0, which could lead to more terms.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps I can look at the string in terms of pairs or possible splits into production rules.\n\nLet me try to group the string into possible sequences that could match the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is: t97 t92 t59 t42 t47 t28 t50 t78 t50 t29 t18 t62 t23 t59 t86 t18 t59 t59 t49 t59 t29 t18.\n\nLet me see if I can map these to the grammar.\n\nI know that S starts the derivation and the entire string must be a derivation of S.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t97, t92, then other tokens. But S is a non-terminal that produces, for example, NT23 NT5. So let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if t97 is a terminal. Yes, from NT20 \u2192 't97', and NT20 is in the start symbol's productions.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is NT20 \u2192 't97'.\n\nBut then, after t97, what comes next? In the string, it's t92.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT20, it can also produce NT26 NT30. Maybe it's a combination?\n\nWait, no. Since it's CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, so the leftmost derivation would start with A and expand into BC. So each expansion can only produce two symbols directly from a single non-terminal.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT23 NT5 (from the grammar), then the string must start with the first symbols of NT23 and NT5.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's t97 t92 t59 t42..., which suggests that the first symbol is t97, so T20.\n\nBut S's first production is either:\n\nS \u2192 NT23 NT5, which starts with NT23, so the first symbol should come from NT23's first symbol.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t97, which is from NT20. So that would imply that S's production must derive t97 first, which is not the case because S's first production doesn't start with NT20 directly; it starts with NT23 or others.\n\nThis might mean that the string does not start with a terminal, but according to the grammar, the string must start with an expansion that leads to terminals, or S must directly produce a terminal. However, S itself is a non-terminal. So for the string to be in the language, the entire leftmost derivation of S must be a sequence that ends in all terminals.\n\nLooking back, the string starts with t9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-395","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of these 't' tokens, which I assume are terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. From what I remember, a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form has productions where each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two terminal symbols or two non-terminal symbols. Each production looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are either terminals or non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the productions are like S \u2192 NT23 NT24 or S \u2192 NT20 NT16, which fit the second option\u2014two non-terminals. There are some with one terminal, like NT5 -> t26. So this seems to be correctly in CNG, I think.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t74 t23 t28 t49 t91 t86 t74 t49 t18 t23 t59 t86 t50 t94 t59 t59 t49 t29 t59 t86 t74 t94 t26\". That's a series of terminals, but I need to see if they can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNG, and assuming it's without \u03b5-productions and the start symbol is S, I can think about how to derive this string step by step. \n\nI should probably start by identifying possible top-level productions that could lead to the start symbol S, which in turn starts the derivation. Looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the only productions are starting with S \u2192 NT23 NT24, S \u2192 NT20 NT16, etc. So the string must ultimately come from one of these.\n\nLet me see if any production starts with t74. Since 't' tokens are terminals, I need to find a non-terminal that can be expanded into t74. Looking through the rules, I see NT15 -> t50 and NT4 -> t26. NT24 -> t1, NT20 -> t97, NT18 -> t92, NT7 -> t82, NT26 -> t69, NT30 -> t86, and others. Wait, I don't see t74 as a terminal; actually, the only 't's are t26, t49, t50, t91, t86, t92, t94, t59, etc.\n\nWait, in the string provided, I see several t74s, t23, t28, t49, etc. So looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any terminal t74 or t23. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n- NT23 can be 't49' or other non-terminals. Similarly, NT28 might produce 't80', etc. Let me verify each terminal in the string.\n\nWait, the string includes t74, which isn't listed as a terminal in any of the rules. Hmm. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I see NT15 -> t50 and NT5 -> t26, but nothing for t74. So if the string has t74, which isn't a terminal, that's a problem because all productions must derive into terminals. So either the string is invalid from the start, or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar, NT23 has a production to 't49', but not 't74'. Wait, let me check again: the grammar includes NT15 -> t50, which is terminal. Then NT5 \u2192 t26, and others. But in the string, t74 appears. Since there's no rule for NT7 or NT23 that directly produce t74, that's a red flag.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Let me double-check the grammar rules. I'll scan the rules:\n\nLooking for terminals in the RHS:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT7 \u2192 t82\n- NT15 \u2192 t50\n- NT20 \u2192 t97\n- NT23 \u2192 t49 (multiple)\n- NT28 \u2192 t80\n- NT3 \u2192 't25'?\nWait, looking through, for example:\n\n- NT23 has multiple productions, some are non-terminals like NT5, NT25. But I don't see any production of NT23 that results in t74.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 -> t50\n- NT5 -> t26\n- NT23 -> t49\n- NT26 -> something\n- etc.\n\nBut the string has 't74' which is not a terminal, so maybe this is impossible. If the grammar doesn't have any production that creates t74 as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated because there's no way to get t74. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nYes, I don't see any NT being expanded into t74. For example, looking at NT7: it's NT7 -> NT23 NT2, NT23 can be t49, and others. So t74 isn't a terminal. Therefore, the string has a token 't74' that isn't derived from any rule, making it impossible for the string to be in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string was mistyped. But assuming the input is correct, the string includes a 't74' which isn't in any terminal production, so the answer is 'No'. \n\nWait, but wait a minute, let's check again. Maybe I missed a rule. Let's go through each rule:\n\nLooking at all the rules, I only see terminals like t1, t26, t49, etc. None for t74. So unless there's an error, the string can't be generated.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the string is incorrectly presented, but with the given info, it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-396","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t50 t92 t92 t91 t26 t47 t97 t28 t47 t92 t59 t23 t59 t59 t94 t92 t59 t86 t86 t97 t74 t92 t59`. All the tokens are terminals since they end with 't' and 't' is a terminal symbol (as it appears in some rules). \n\nI'll check the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S and has productions like S -> NT23 NT5. But in the string, the first token is t50. Looking at the grammar rules, I don't see any production for NT (other than the ones starting with t), but t50 seems like a terminal from the rule NT15 -> 't50'. Similarly, t92 is from NT20 -> 't92' and t26 is from NT5 -> 't26'. \n\nWait, that can't be right because in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which should come from the sequence of productions derived from S. \n\nWait, the string starts with t50, which comes from NT15. Then t92 is NT20. Next, t92 again, which can be NT20 again. Then t91 is NT7. So the string starts as NT15 NT20 NT20 NT7... But according to the grammar rules, S can only go to specific NT combinations, but perhaps through derivations.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules. The first production is S -> NT23 NT5. But t50 is from NT15, so unless there's a way to derive NT15 from S, which doesn't seem possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Or perhaps I need to see if the string can be broken down into the productions starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree. Let me think about the string: t50, t92, t92, t91, t26, t47, t97, t28, t47, t92, t59, t23, t59, t59, t94, t92, t59, t86, t86, t97, t74, t92, t59.\n\nLet me map each token to its production:\n\nt50: NT15\nt92: NT20 (since NT20 is t92)\nt92: NT20 again\nt91: NT7\nt26: NT5\nt47: NT23 (since NT23 is t47)\nt97: NT28 (since NT28 is t97)\nt28: NT7 (since NT7 is t28)\nt47: NT23 (t47)\nt92: NT20\nt59: NT9 (since NT9 is t59)\nt23: NT15 (wait, NT15 is t50, but t23 is from NT15? Or is it another production? Wait, in the rules, I see NT15->'t50'. So where does t23 come from? Looking at the rules, NT23 has several productions, some leading to terminals, others to non-terminals. For example, NT23 -> NT5 NT19, which is t26 and t19. Or NT23 -> NT6 NT9 (t47 and t26). Wait, no, t23 is just one token. Wait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking back, I see that NT23 has several productions leading to terminals or non-terminals. For example, NT23 can produce 't49' or 't50', but where does t23 come from? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe t23 is an NT that produces a terminal. Let me check the rules for NT23.\n\nWait, the rules for NT23 are: NT23 -> NT5 NT19, NT23-> NT6 NT9, NT23-> NT15 NT1, NT23-> NT27 NT27, NT23-> NT4 NT23, etc. None of these produce t23. So maybe t23 is not a terminal but a non-terminal. Wait, that can't be because the string has t23, which would have to be a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT23 has a rule: NT15 -> 't50', so that's correct. Another rule: NT23->NT5 NT19, which isn't a terminal. Similarly, NT5 is 't26', so perhaps t23 is a mistake, or perhaps it's NT23 as a non-terminal that somehow produces a terminal. But in the given rules, I don't see a production where NT23 is a terminal. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider that t23 is not a terminal, which would mean the string is invalid. But that can't be because the string is provided, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me step back. Maybe the string is a sequence of terminals derived from the grammar. To check that, I should see if the string can be parsed starting from S by applying the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into components. The string is: t50 t92 t92 t91 t26 t47 t97 t28 t47 t92 t59 t23 t59 t59 t94 t92 t59 t86 t86 t97 t74 t92 t59.\n\nPerhaps I can group them into pairs that match the productions from S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT23 NT5. So the first two tokens should be something that can derive from NT23 and NT5.\n\nFrom the string, the first token is t50, which is NT15. The second is t92, which is NT20. So for S to produce NT23 NT5, we need NT23 to be t50? No, because NT23's productions don't produce t50. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the production S -> NT23 NT5, but NT23 is a non-terminal that may derive to t50? No, because in the rules, NT23 isn't directly t50; rather, NT15 is t50. So perhaps this is a problem. Maybe the first production path doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can produce other combinations. Let me check all S productions:\n\nS can derive:\n- NT23 NT5\n- NT20 NT16\n- NT17 NT3\n- NT20 NT6\n- NT9 NT5\n\nSo I need to see if the string starts with any of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t50 (NT15), t92 (NT20). So that would need to come from NT20, which is not one of the combinations after S. Because the only S production that starts with NT20 is S -> NT20 NT16, S -> NT20 NT6, and S-> NT20 NT9. So the first token after the initial S should be part of that structure.\n\nWait, the first token is t50, which is NT15. But S's initial productions don't have NT15 as the first NT. So perhaps the string starts with NT15, which isn't directly part of any S production. That suggests the string might not be in the language, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is structured in such a way that the initial S uses a production that eventually leads to t50 as part of the derivation.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the string can be broken down starting from the end. Sometimes, looking at the end helps. The last token is t59, which is NT5. So perhaps the last production is something that leads to NT5.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5 appears as part of many productions, like NT5 -> 't26', but also in NT5's own production: NT5 -> NT15 NT8.\n\nSo perhaps the derivation ends with NT5 -> 't26', but in the string, it's t59, which maps to 't26'. So that would require NT5 -> t26, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal (like S, NT23, etc.) can expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals end with 't' followed by numbers, except for some like 't74' and 't91', but some are actual terminals, like 't49'. Wait, no, looking again, most of these are non-terminals except the very end where some are 't-something', but actually, I think all the 't-' strings are terminals. For example, 't49' probably represents a terminal symbol. So the string consists of these terminals, each being 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string given is: `t59 t28 t91 t18 t92 t94 t91 t78 t74 t78 t59 t59 t59 t18 t18 t26 t86 t18 t50 t91 t94 t29 t28 t49`.\n\nSo, the string has 24 elements. Now, the grammar's terminals are all of the form 't' followed by numbers, like t59, t28, etc. So the string is composed entirely of these terminals, except for some I'm not sure. Wait, no, all are terminals, so the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nNow, the grammar's start symbol is S, which expands into combinations of non-terminals. My first thought is to parse the string from the start, breaking it down according to the grammar. However, with 24 terminals, that's going to be a bit tedious.\n\nI should first look for any patterns in the expansions. Let me see which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 t82. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, something like NT23 can produce a terminal. Let me go through the rules.\n\nWait, looking carefully, for instance:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6 \u2192 which could be further broken down. But other non-terminals produce terminals, like NT2 \u2192 t94, which is a terminal, meaning 't94' is directly produced by NT2.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 t26, so 't26' is a terminal.\n\nLooking for how the string can be formed step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to represent the string as a sequence and try to split it into the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or recursive approaches, but since I'm just thinking through this manually, let me look for possible splits.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string:\n\n1. t59\n2. t28\n3. t91\n4. t18\n5. t92\n6. t94\n7. t91\n8. t78\n9. t74\n10. t78\n11. t59\n12. t59\n13. t59\n14. t18\n15. t18\n16. t26\n17. t86\n18. t18\n19. t50\n20. t91\n21. t94\n22. t29\n23. t28\n24. t49\n\nNow, the idea is to decompose this string into the productions of the grammar.\n\nLet's start with the first terminal, t59. Looking at the grammar, the production that produces t59 is not directly obvious. Let me check which non-terminals result in t59.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 t59. Yes, in the last few rules, I see a production:\n\nNT9 -> t59.\n\nSo, that means 't59' is directly produced by NT9. So the first step is:\n\nt59 \u2192 NT9.\n\nNow, what can produce NT9? Let's look at the grammar. Looking through all the rules, it seems that NT9 only appears on the left side of a production. Looking:\n\nNT9 appears as part of:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT5 NT19\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT29 NT29\n\nBut wait, looking through the entire list, I see:\n\nLooking at the productions, the only time NT9 appears is in:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the entire production list.\n\nWait, here's the entire list of productions:\n\nS is the start symbol.\n\nLooking for where NT9 is on the left:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 t59, yes.\n\nLooking for rules where NT9 appears on the left side, perhaps it's only in:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 NT30 NT11\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT25 NT19\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT23 NT11\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT4 NT29\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, maybe NT9 is used elsewhere. But in any case, since the string starts with t59, which comes from NT9, so I can replace t59 with NT9.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT9, and now we need to expand NT9.\n\nLooking for how NT9 can be expanded. Wait, in the given rules, I don't see any productions for NT9 as left-hand side. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT9 only appears on the right-hand side:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT2 NT25\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT3 NT1\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT8 NT24\n\n...\n\nAh, so looking for NT9 on the left, I don't see any. Wait, wait, I must have overlooked something.\n\nWait, there's a rule NT9 \u2192 t59, so that's a terminal production. But are there any rules where NT9 is on the left? Let me scan all the rules again.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n1. S->NT23 NT24 NT5\n2. S->...\n3. ... all the way to...\n26. NT20 -> NT26 NT30\n27. NT15 -> NT23 NT6\n28. NT7 -> NT23 NT2\n29. NT11 -> NT15 NT0\n30. NT2 -> NT25 NT19\n31. NT26 -> NT8 NT26\n32. NT27 -> NT4 NT26\n33. NT2 -> NT23 NT11\n34. NT9 -> NT5 NT2\nHmm, wait, here is a production: NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nWait, yes, looking at rule 34: NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nSo, NT9 can expand into NT5 and NT2.\n\nSo, then, since we're trying to expand NT9, we can split it into two non-terminals: NT5 and NT2.\n\nTherefore, the string after t59 is then [NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2]. So, the remainder of the string after t59 is 't28 t91 t18 t92 t94 t91 t78 t74 t78 t59 t59 t59 t18 t18 t26 t86 t18 t50 t91 t94 t29 t28 t49'.\n\nWait, no, no. Actually, when we have a production, each non-terminal in the production can produce a string. So, in this case, since t59 is replaced by NT9, which can be expanded into NT5 and NT2, each of which can be expanded further.\n\nWait, but the next part of the string is t28, so after the initial t59, the next is t28, which would be another non-terminal expansion. Wait, perhaps it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, let me step back. The entire string is a concatenation of terminals, and the grammar needs to generate this string.\n\nSince the first symbol is 't59', which is NT9. So, the derivation starts with NT9 expanding to 't59'. Now, what comes after in the string after 't59' is 't28', which is the next symbol, so it must come from another part of the expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Since the string is formed by expanding S, which can generate a certain string. The string is t59 t28 t91 t18... etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see the string as being composed in parts that correspond to the NT9 \u2192 ... \u2192 t59, and then the rest after t5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of a set of production rules. \n\nFirst, I'll parse the given grammar to understand the structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I need to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t92 t62 t18 t74 t69 t28 t49 t92 t59 t59 t29 t18 t29 t23 t50 t92 t59 t29 t18 t49 t47 t26 t47 t59 t18 t59`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some symbols like NT24, NT5, etc., are non-terminals, and the others are terminals, which correspond to 't' followed by numbers. The terminals in the string are t92, t62, etc.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals might directly produce terminals. For instance, some productions are like NT24 \u2192 t1, which is a terminal. So, I can use these to replace the non-terminals in the string.\n\nLet me start by looking for terminals in the string and see if they match any production rules.\n\n1. The first symbol is t92. Looking at the grammar, I see several NT24 \u2192 t1. But t92 isn't directly matched by any of these. Alternatively, maybe it's derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t92. Let me check if any non-terminals can produce t92.\n\nLooking deeper into the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT26\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11 or NT15 NT26\n- NT26 can lead to NT8 NT26, which can loop or produce other stuff.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to find a path from the start symbol S to the given string through the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of derivation replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. However, in this case, the given string is a series of terminals, and each step can only produce one terminal. But since in CNF, each production can at most replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but terminals can't split further. Wait, actually, no: in CNF, the right-hand side must be exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but terminals are leaf nodes and can't be split.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, in each production, the non-terminal is replaced by two symbols: either two non-terminals (BC) or a terminal (a). \n\nGiven that, the derivation of a string S would break down into a tree where each node is a non-terminal and each leaf is a terminal. The string is built by concatenating the leaves of the rightmost derivation.\n\nSo, the string given is 27 terminals. Since each production can generate terminals, but each step adds at most two symbols (if it's two non-terminals) or one (if it's a terminal). This suggests that the number of symbols in the string should be a number that can be obtained by repeatedly adding 1 or 2. Wait, actually, in any context-free grammar, the length of the string can be determined by the structure of the grammar. But in this case, the string length is 27.\n\nLet me see: The start symbol is S. Each step can replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which would add one symbol (since each replacement of a non-terminal adds one more symbol: from 1 to 2). Alternatively, replacing a non-terminal with a terminal would keep the count the same. However, over the entire derivation, the number of terminals can vary.\n\nWait, no, the rules for the length of the string in a context-free grammar can be tricky. Let me think differently. Since it's a context-free grammar, the language is a context-free language, and the given string is a concatenation of terminals. To check if the string is in the language, I can perform a parsing attempt.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite extensive, perhaps the best way is to try to parse the string from the end backward, using the Reverse Derivation method. This method starts from the string and tries to reduce it back to the start symbol by applying the reverse of the production rules.\n\nThe Reverse Derivation steps would involve:\n\n1. Starting with the entire string.\n2. Splitting the string into pairs of symbols from left to right, trying to match the right-hand side (RHS) of the productions.\n3. For each such pair, if the RHS of a production matches (in reverse), replace the pair with the non-terminal, then repeat the process until either the entire string is reduced to the start symbol S or it's determined that no such reduction is possible.\n\nLet me attempt this.\n\nFirst, the string is: t92 t62 t18 t74 t69 t28 t49 t92 t59 t59 t29 t18 t29 t23 t50 t92 t59 t29 t18 t49 t47 t26 t47 t59 t18 t59.\n\nThat's 27 symbols. Since each step in Reverse Derivation involves trying to contract pairs of symbols into a single non-terminal, and since the number of symbols decreases by 1 each time (as each pair becomes a single non-terminal), to get from 27 symbols back to 1, we'd need 26 reductions. \n\nHowever, manually performing 26 reductions would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can look for patterns or specific production rules that might help.\n\nLooking for the first symbol t92. Is there a non-terminal that can produce t92? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT2 \u2192 t94\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT22 \u2192 t28 (from NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT11, but NT23 might produce more)\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT24 is a non-terminal, and it's never directly producing a terminal; instead, it's being used as part of other productions. For example, NT18 \u2192 NT12 NT26, and NT26 can produce t8 NT26 (from NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT26). Hmm, wait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking for terminals: t1 is produced by NT24, t23 is produced by NT... let's see, where do the terminals appear? \n\nLooking through the grammar, several rules end with 't' followed by a number or are directly 't' with a number. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t1\n- NT2 \u2192 t94\n- NT5 \u2192 t26\n- NT22 \u2192 t28\n- NT7 \u2192 t24\nWait, no: NT7 \u2192 t24? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT24 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT3\n\nWait, but there's also a rule NT23 \u2192 t50 somewhere? No, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can produce the given terminals. For example:\n\nt92 is in the string. Looking for any non-terminal that can produce t92. Scanning the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT12 NT26\n- NT50 is NT15 \u2192 t50\n- NT92: Is there any production where NT... produces t92?\n\nWait, perhaps looking for productions where RHS includes t92 as one of the terminals. Let me search the grammar for terms that include t92:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I find:\n\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT24 \u2192 which leads to t1 at the end.\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT16 \u2192 ends with t16.\n- S \u2192 NT17 NT3 \u2192 has t17 and t3.\n- S \u2192 NT20 NT6 \u2192 ends with t6.\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5 \u2192 ends with t5.\n\nHmm, none of the starting productions end with t92. So S can't directly produce t92. So perhaps t92 is produced by a non-terminal that is derived from S through some productions.\n\nLooking further, let's see which non-terminals can produce t92. Looking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t24 NT6\nWait, perhaps more importantly, looking for rules where the RHS includes t92.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT11, etc.\nWait, let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
