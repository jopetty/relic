Hmm, perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the bottom of the grammar. I notice several rules where non-terminals are assigned 't' followed by a number, like:\n\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT12 -> 't78'\n- NT1 -> 't6' (Wait, no, 't6' is from NT1)\nWait, let me parse each non-terminal's direct productions.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT3 -> 't1' (so that's a terminal)\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't21'\nNT2 -> 't80'\nNT12 -> 't78'\nNT24 -> 't72' (I see multiple NT24 rules)\nNT27 -> 't77'\nNT31 -> 't22', 't35', 't69'\nNT6 -> 't53' (Ah, here's one)\nNT5 -> 't68', 't30'\nNT19 -> 't1', 't15'\nNT28 -> 't82' but also other 't's like 't8' or 't46'\nNT29 -> 't62'\nNT34 -> 't12', 't1' etc., but 't1' is likely\nNT15 -> 't21', 't29', 't33', which are strings like 't21' etc.\nNT33 -> 't22', 't52'\nNT23 -> 't20', 't20', 't34', 't19'\nNT0 -> 't71', etc.\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT24 -> 't17', 't42', 't49', etc.\n\nWait, I see that NT6 has a production NT6 -> 't53'.

Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking for any rule where RHS is only 't53', and nothing else.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT6: It's defined as NT24 NT12. Not terminal. So to get to 't53', I have to see if any non-terminal can generate 't53'.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me look again:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT15 -> 't68', 't35', etc.\n\n- NT5 -> 't68', 't30'\n\n- NT19 -> 't1', 't15'\n\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n\n- NT31 -> 't69', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the string is formed through multiple steps.\n\nBut wait, the string is \"t53\". So, if a rule directly produces 't53', then yes. But from the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't53'. But wait, maybe via a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nThe grammar lines:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12\n\n- NT12 -> 't78'\n\n- NT24 -> NT72 (which is 't80')\n\nSo that would not help.\n\nWait, maybe another way: perhaps multiple non-terminals can combine to produce 't53'.\n\nAlternatively, check every non-terminal for whether it can derive 't53'. For that, perhaps looking at the rules that directly produce 't' strings.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12\n\nWait, no, that's still non-terminals. Hmm. Wait, looking through the entire list:\n\nIs there any non-terminal that can directly produce 't53' as a terminal? Let me read each rule:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- S starts with NT30 NT32\n\n- Then each of these seems to be combinations of other non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I need to see if any non-terminal can be applied multiple times to reach 't53'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each rule. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules where a non-terminal can produce a string starting with 't':\n\n- NT12: NT12 -> 't78'\n\n- NT23: NT23 -> 't34', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me list all rules where the RHS is terminals only:\n\nLooking through each production as RHS:\n\nAt NT6, NT6 -> NT24 NT12, which are both non-terminals.\n\nNT24 has multiple rules, like NT24 -> 't72' (yes! So that's a terminal production: NT24 can produce 't72', 't56', etc.\n\nSo, if a non-terminal can derive 't72', that's fine.\n\nBut to get 't53', I need to see if any rule produces 't53' as a terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\nAh, I found NT6 -> 't53'? No, NT6's production is NT24 NT12, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps by combining NTs. Let me think through the entire derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct rule is somewhere else. Wait, perhaps in the given rules, some non-terminals have direct 't' outputs. I see:\n\nLooking for 't53' in the RHS:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT6 is defined as NT24 NT12, both non-terminals. So not 't53'.\n\nWait, is there any production where a non-terminal ends up being 't53'? For example, NT6 can produce 't53' if, through other steps, it can.\n\nWait, perhaps after multiple expansions. Maybe starting from S, derive a string including 't53'.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is No because there's no rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't53'.\n\nWait, no, I'm 100% sure I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the list again.\n\nLooking at NT24:\n\nNT24 is defined in several places as:\n\n- NT24 -> NT72\n- NT24 -> NT42\n- NT24 -> NT49\n- NT24 -> NT20 NT22\n- NT24 -> NT31 NT6\n- NT24 -> NT17\n- NT24 -> DT12\n\nWait, perhaps look at each of these and see if any of them derive 't53'.\n\nWait, NT24 -> DT72. DT72 is 't72' which ends with '72', so not '53'.\n\nNT24 -> NT42: NT42 is another non-terminal. Then, perhaps NT42 produces something else.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, if any non-terminal can directly produce 't53', but I don't see that.

Let's start by understanding the grammar structure and then see how the string might be derived.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. Looking at the rules, I notice several terminal symbols, which suggests that the grammar is not purely context-free in terms of strings, as it's mixing terminals and non-terminals. However, I'll proceed methodically.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t62`. In the grammar, I see that `t62` is a terminal symbol. Now, I'll check the production rules to see if any right-hand sides contain `t62` as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice:\n\n- `NT6 -> NT24 NT12`\n  - `t62` is on the right side, so `t62` comes from `NT6`. So, to get `t62`, `NT6` must be derived.\n\nNow, I need to see if `NT6` can be derived from the start symbol `S`. Let's trace the productions leading to `NT6`.\n\nThe start symbol `S` has two rules:\n1. `S -> NT32 NT14`\n2. `S -> NT18 NT32`\n\nNo direct production for `NT32` or `NT14` leading to `NT6`, so that's not the path. Let's look for `NT6`.\n\n`NT6` is defined as:\n`NT6 -> NT24 NT12`\n\nWait, that's only the rule for `NT6`. So, how do we get `NT6`? We might have to derive through `NT6` from other non-terminals. Let's think about the dependencies.\n\nLooking for where `NT6` is used elsewhere, I see:\n- `GT18 -> NT24 NT12NT6NT21`\n- Wait, that's a rule where `NT6` is part of a larger production. So, for instance, a non-terminal might produce a string that includes `t62` through various steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production where `t62` is on the right-hand side. From the rules, `t62` occurs in `NT6 -> NT24 NT12` and also in several rules where `t62` is directly the right-hand side. Hmm, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- `NT6 -> NT24 NT12`\n- `t62` appears in `NT6 -> ...` but not directly as a terminal except in some other non-terminals like in `NT24 -> t72` or similar, but I need to see if `t62` is reachable.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, I see `NT6 -> NT24 NT12` and `NT12 -> NT78` according to the rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the rules that produce `t62`.\n\nWait, in the rules, I can see:\n\n- `NT31 -> NT6 NT33` and in `NT31`, `t62` is on the right.\n- Also, `NT33 -> NT22 NT11` and `NT11 -> NT20 NT19` etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to approach this by checking which non-terminals produce `t62` directly. Wait, in the rules, the right-hand sides sometimes have terminal symbols as leaves. So for example:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. But in CFG, a production can have a single terminal, which would correspond to a string of length one. So, in the given rules, for example, `NT6 -> t62`? Wait, no, the rules all have two non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, I'm looking through all the rules again.\n\nWait, let me parse all the rules again:\n\nThe rules are provided as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nThen many other NT rules. Wait, the NT rules all have two non-terminals except for some that have a single terminal. Wait, looking more carefully, I see for example:\n\n- `NT24 -> t72`, wait no, the rule list shows `NT24 -> t72 NT1' something? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see lines like:\n\n- `NT6 -> NT24 NT12`\n- So, all the NT rules seem to have two non-terminals except perhaps some that may just be in the form of t followed by a number.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, the right-hand sides after NTs sometimes have terminals. For example, at the end, there are rules like:\n\n- `NT15 -> 't71'`\n- `NT15 -> 't35'`\n- `NT23 -> 't34'`\n- `NT0 -> 't40'`\n- etc.\n\nSo these are NTs that directly produce a single terminal symbol. So, for example, `NT15` can produce `t71` or `t35`, etc.\n\nSo, when I see `t62` in the string, I need to see if any NTs can directly produce `t62`. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- `NT6 -> NT24 NT12`\n- Not a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look if any NT rule directly outputs `t62`. Going through the list, I don't see `t62` as a terminal in any single rule. So that's confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine.\n\nLooking through each rule carefully, I don't see an NT rule where the right-hand side is just `t62`. So perhaps `t62` is produced through a series of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a production like `NT24 -> t72 something`, but that's not `t62`. So perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should check if any NT rule ends with `t62` somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in a chain. For example, NT6 can produce NT24 and NT12, then maybe NT24 can produce further terminals which include `t62`. Let me trace this path.\n\nSo, suppose NT6 -> NT24 NT12. Then, if NT24 can produce something that includes `t62`, then `t62` could be in the string.\n\nLooking at NT24 production rules:\n\n- `NT24 -> NT4 NT1`\n- `NT24 -> NT30 NT2`\n- `NT24 -> NT2 NT22`\n- `NT24 -> NT24 NT2`\n- `NT24 -> NT7 NT32`\n- `NT24 -> NT30 NT6`\n- `NT24 -> NT27 NT20`\n- `NT24 -> NT4 NT18`\n- `NT24 -> NT24 NT24`\n- And so on...\n\nNone of these directly produce a terminal. All are combinations of NTs, so to reach a terminal like `t62`, the derivation must go through NTs that can produce `t62`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got the NT rules wrong. Perhaps I should consider that the right-hand sides sometimes have a mix, but I think in this grammar all NT rules produce two NTs. However, looking again, the first two rules for S produce two NTs each. So, the entire string would be built by combining these and other NTs, each contributing symbols until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, but looking at the list, perhaps some of the NTs do directly produce a terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at the end of the list:\n\n- `NT15 -> 't71'`\n- `NT15 -> 't35'`\n- `NT23 -> 't34'`\n- `NT0 -> 't40'`\n- etc.\n\nSo, perhaps `t62` is not directly produced by any NT, but maybe through some paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the `t62` isn't present in the grammar. Let me check the provided rules again carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT rule where the right-hand side is `t62`. Therefore, `t62` is not directly produced by any NT in this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting the terminals. For example, is there a rule where a non-terminal directly leads to `t62`?\n\nLooking at all the rules again, I find:\n\nIn the list, I can see:\n\n- `NT24 -> t72`\nWait, no, looking again, I see:\n- `NT24 -> NT30 NT2`\n- `NT24 -> NT24 NT24`\n- `NT24 -> NT4 NT18`\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing `t62` anywhere because the provided rules don't include it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-12","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if the string `t19 t72` is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit more structured, but still, it's quite complex with many production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll take a look at the grammar to see what symbols are present and understand the structure. The grammar consists of terminals, which are the letters like `t1`, `t72`, etc., and non-terminals like `S`, `NT30`, `NT4`, and so on. Since the given string contains `t19` and `t72`, I can note that these are terminals, so the string is built directly from these symbols.\n\nThe string is `t19 t72`, which is two tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule only produces two non-terminals. That might complicate things because each step only introduces two symbols, which would typically generate a string of length two, four, etc., if expanded from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, `S`, I see that it has two production rules:\n1. `S -> NT32 NT32`\n2. `S -> NT14 NT32`\n\nSo, no matter which rule is used, S expands to two non-terminals. From there, each of those non-terminals will expand according to their respective production rules.\n\nGiven the target string `t19 t72`, it's exactly two symbols, so it could be that each symbol comes from an expansion of a single non-terminal. That would mean each step in the derivation reduces the count from two non-terminals down to two terminals, but since the grammar is in CNF, they can only produce two non-terminals at a time, not terminals. Wait, but I'm getting confused here. In CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a single terminal. But wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a single terminal. So in this case, each production can only generate two non-terminals at a time, unless it's a terminal. So, the only way to get a terminal in the string is if a production rule directly terminals a non-terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal symbol. For example, `NT15 -> 't71'`, `NT15 -> 't35'`, etc. So these are the leaf nodes in the grammar tree. But the string we're looking at is `t19 t72`. Let's see if both of these terminals have corresponding production rules.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I spot a few where NT19 produces 't15': `NT19 -> 't15'` (twice). No 't19' production except that. Hmm, wait, let me scan the rules. I see:\n\n- `NT19 -> 't15'` appears twice, but no rule where NT19 -> 't19'. That's a problem because if `t19` needs to be generated, but there's no rule that directly produces it. The only way is if there's a production that can derive 't19' through other non-terminals, but that doesn't seem possible if the rule isn't present.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Perhaps I missed any rule that leads to 't19'. Let me scan the given rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through all the production rules for NT19, I see:\n\n- `NT19 -> 't15'`\n- Another `NT19 -> 't15'`\n\nNo other rules where NT19 \u2192 't19'. So that's an issue because the string has `t19`, which may require that NT19 has a production rule that includes 't19', which isn't there.\n\nTherefore, the production rules do not allow 't19' to be generated. If that's the case, the string `t19 t72` can't be generated by this grammar because there's no rule that directly produces 't19'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Could there be a path where `t19` is generated from another non-terminal via a chain of productions? Let me check if any non-terminal leads to 't19'.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- `NT7 -> 't1'`\n- `NT2 -> 't28'`\n- `NT3 -> 't1'`\n- `NT1 -> 't6'`\n- `NT13 -> 't28'`\n- `NT13 -> 't6'`\nWait, it seems that every non-terminal either produces terminals or other non-terminals, but 't19' isn't directly produced. Let me check NT19's rules again. No, none of the rules produce 't19'; the only one is `NT19 -> 't15'`.\n\nSo, if the string has 't19', which isn't a terminal for any NT, it can't be generated because there's no production rule that directly allows a non-terminal to generate 't19'. Therefore, the string can't be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the production allows for something else, but given the rules, it seems impossible.\n\nAnother angle: could the given string be part of a longer derivation where 't19' is derived indirectly? For example, maybe a non-terminal A \u2192 B t19, but looking at the rules, all non-terminals expand to pairs of non-terminals or a single terminal. So, no, since the only way to get a terminal is via direct rules, and 't19' isn't directly produced by any NT.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string `t19 t72` cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no production rule that allows either 't19' or 't72' to be generated as terminals.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-18","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t12 t77\" can be generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll start by analyzing the given string. It consists of two terminals: \"t12\" and \"t77\". Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must have a length that's equal to the number of productions taken along the derivation tree. Each non-terminal production adds two non-terminals, but terminals only add one. However, since all non-terminals in CNF produce terminals (or two non-terminals eventually leading to terminals), the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n where n is the number of non-terminal steps. In this case, the string has two symbols, so n should be 1, meaning the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT and the string should be the two terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce other non-terminals like NT32, NT14, etc. Each of these non-terminals must expand into the terminals to form the string.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, there are several that expand into \"t\" symbols. For example, NT7 is defined as NT14 NT23. But I need to find if any non-terminal can directly produce \"t12\" and \"t77\".\n\nLooking at NT12: In the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6, and NT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12. Also, NT24 has other productions. Wait, maybe another approach is better here.\n\nWait, the string is \"t12 t77\". So each \"t\" must come from a terminal production. I'll need to find if there are non-terminals NT that can produce \"t12\" and \"t77\" respectively.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT12: in the grammar, is there a rule for NT12? Let me scan. Hmm, no, I don't see NT12 directly. Wait, perhaps NT12 is part of a larger non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for Nts that produce \"t\" symbols. Looking through the rules, for example, NT7 \u2192 t40, but in the problem's grammar, NT7 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no, wait, in the given grammar, some Nts have productions that include 't'.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. For example, I see NT7 \u2192 't1' and NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. But I don't see NT12 directly leading to any terminals. Wait, maybe the NT12 is a non-terminal that can eventually produce \"t12\".\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT12 is defined as NT10 NT5. Wait, no, let me see. The given grammar has:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT4 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n\nWait, maybe looking for the productions that have 't' symbols as their right-hand sides.\n\nSearching for 't' in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT14 \u2192 't43'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n- NT0 \u2192 't32'\n- NT24 \u2192 't79'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT24 \u2192 't17'\n- NT17 \u2192 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT31 \u2192 't22'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't84'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't80'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nOk, so all these 't's are directly from terminals. So any NT that directly produces these terminals is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's see the structure of \"t12 t77\". So, the start symbol S must produce a sequence of non-terminals that eventually expand into these two terminals.\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT32\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32\nSo, S has two options, both starting with NT followed by NT.\n\nWait, but the string has two \"t\"s, so each must come from a separate NT production. Let me look for a way to expand S into two non-terminals, each of which expands into one \"t\".\n\nLet me check which non-terminals can produce \"t12\" and \"t77\".\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce \"t12\":\n\nLooking at the list above, I see NT24 is defined as NT17 NT25, but I don't see any production of NT24 directly to \"t12\". Wait, perhaps I need to see if any NT can eventually produce \"t12\".\n\nWait, another approach: Since the string is \"t12 t77\", each \"t\" comes from a terminal produced by some NT. So, we need to find a way for S to split into two NTs, one that produces \"t12\" and another that produces \"t77\".\n\nWait, perhaps \"t12\" is from NT12, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT12 directly. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t12\" comes from NT24, let me check NT24's productions. The grammar has:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nNT4 \u2192 't68' or 't56', depending on the rule.\n\nWait, no, 't68' comes from NT4 directly. Wait, but I'm trying to find a way to get \"t12\". Maybe I need to track down which NT can produce \"t12\".\n\nWait, looking at the right-hand sides, I don't see \"t12\" as any production, so perhaps \"t12\" comes from a non-terminal that's not directly in the grammar. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps \"t12\" is not directly present, so the string \"t12 t77\" cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"t12\" is part of the production for another non-terminal. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The string is \"t12 t77\". Each \"t\" must come from a separate NT production, as they have to be in separate positions because they're the only terminals. So, starting from S, which produces two NTs, perhaps one of them can produce \"t12\" and the other \"t77\".\n\nBut in the grammar, no non-terminal is directly producing \"t12\" or \"t77\". So unless a non-terminal can derive into \"t12\" and another into \"t77\", but from the given grammar, the terminals are all 't' followed by numbers. So I don't see any NT that directly produces \"t12\" or \"t77\".\n\nFor example, looking at NT24, it can produce \"t68\" via NT4 \u2192 't68', but that's a different terminal.\n\nSo perhaps because \"t12\" is not a terminal in any NT production, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the NT structure allows for it through expansions, but given the grammar doesn't have any NT directly producing \"t12\" or \"t77\", it's impossible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string \"t12 t77\" consists of two terminals that are not directly produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar. Since the grammar only produces specific \"t\" symbols, it's impossible for \"t12\" or \"t77\" to be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-28","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to determine if the string `t64 t65 t69` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. However, looking at the provided grammar, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT30 NT32 is fine, but NT24 has productions like NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13, which is just two non-terminals, so that's still CNF. But then there's a production like NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1, but wait, NT24 is non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals. Hmm, but in the provided grammar, I see some lines like NT24 -> NT4 NT1, which are two non-terminals, so that's okay. But I'm seeing that some non-terminals seem to have multiple rules, both generating other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. I should check each rule to ensure they are either producing a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that in the grammar, some rules like NT15 \u2192 't71', which is a terminal string, so that's allowed. But others like NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT30, which is fine as well because it's two non-terminals.\n\nNow, focusing on the string `t64 t65 t69`. Each of these seems to be a terminal symbol. The string has three symbols, so that suggests that there's a production that directly produces these or a sequence of productions that lead to this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's try to find the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string.\n\nS can produce NT30 NT32 or NT18 NT32. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider S \u2192 NT30 NT32.\n\nNow, NT30 can produce NT3 NT30. Wait, that's a recursive rule, like NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which means it can be expanded as NT3 followed by NT30, which can repeat. This is like a left recursion. Similarly, NT3 can produce NT1, which eventually resolves to t6. But wait, in the string, we have t64, which is much larger.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the possible NTs that produce t64. Looking at the rules, I see NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10, but I don't see a production from NT25 to a terminal. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 't71', and other NTs have terminal rules, but perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the grammar. The terminals are the t followed by numbers: t1, t4, t6, t7, t10, t18, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t30, t31, t32, t33, t34, t35, t40, t43, t46, t49, t53, t56, t62, t63, t64, t65, t69, etc.\n\nWait, from the rules, some non-terminals directly produce these terminals. For example, NT34 \u2192 't12' and 't1', and so on.\n\nBut let's see where t64 comes from. Looking through the grammar, NT25 \u2192 't64' is present, according to the rules:\n\nNT25 -> 't64'\n\nSo how can NT25 be derived? Let me look at how NT25 is defined. From the grammar, I don't see NT25 defined on the left side of a production. Wait, checking the initial grammar, all the productions are in the form of NTx \u2192 either other NTs or terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't40' and others. But the only NT that directly produces 't64' is NT25 \u2192 't64'.\n\nWait, looking again: Yes, the rule is NT25 -> 't64'. So to get t64, we need a production that directly gives it, which is from NT25. Now, how does NT25 get derived from the start symbol S?\n\nLooking back, S can generate S through multiple steps, but let's see if any of the productions from S can lead to t64.\n\nLet me first consider S \u2192 NT30 NT32 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT30 NT32: So the string would be two parts, derived from NT30 and NT32. If we can get t64 from NT30 or NT32, that's possible. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, from S \u2192 NT18 NT32: So we can consider NT18 and NT32. Do they produce t65 or t69?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT18 can produce 't74' as well as other non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to try to follow each step to see how we can reach t64, t65, and t69.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string `t64 t65 t69` is a short string, so maybe it's a direct production, but I don't see a rule that directly produces three terminals. The only way is to have the start symbol S or some non-terminal that can produce all three terminals through their expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is such that S expands to NT18 NT32, and from there, each part expands further.\n\nLet me try to break down each part.\n\nAssume S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nNow, NT18 can produce what? Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT18's productions are:\nNT18 -> NT25 NT1\nNT18 -> 't74' (I think, looking back). Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT18, I see:\n\nYes, line: NT18 -> 't74'.\n\nSo NT18 can produce 't74' as a terminal symbol. But in our string, the second token is 't65', not 't74'. So that's a problem unless we have a derivation that produces 't65' from NT18. But NT18's only terminal is 't74', so that's not helpful.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Let me check again: The rules under NT include NT18 producing several NTs and one terminal 't74'. So if NT18 can only directly produce 't74', but our string has 't65', that suggests that the derivation path leading to t65 must be through NT18, but it's producing 't74' instead. So that suggests that this production might not lead directly to t65.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let's consider S \u2192 NT30 NT32.\n\nNT30's productions: NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which is recursive, and NT3 \u2192 NT1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's try another approach. Let's see if there's a way to derive t64, t65, t69.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't74'\n\nWait, but 't65' must come from somewhere else. Let me look for where 't65' is produced.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't69', but that's not helpful. Wait, no: NT17 \u2192 't68', NT13 \u2192 't43', etc. Wait, I think I'm missing something. Wait, I see NT22 \u2192 't3', but that's not helpful. Let me look again for 't65' in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the lines, I see that there is a line: NT17 \u2192 't68'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing 't65' somewhere. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nHmm, I don't immediately see any NT that produces 't65'. Wait, looking again:\n\nYes, in the lines:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28\n\nNT24 -> NT20 NT20\n\nNT6 -> NT24 NT12\n\nWait, perhaps 't65' is produced by another NT. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nLine: NT7 -> 't40'\n\nNo. Here's another line: NT30 -> NT2 NT22\n\nHmm, not helpful. Wait, perhaps I missed a line with 't65'. Let me look through the grammar:\n\nLooking through the lines, I see NT7 -> 't40'\n\nWait, what about NT9?"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A->BC or A->a, making it easier to parse.\n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the string. Since it's a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, I'm assuming each symbol corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. The string has three symbols: t26, t42, t17.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol S can only produce two symbols in the first step. Let's check the start rule. The grammar starts with S, and looking at the productions, S can go to NT32 NT14 or NT30 NT18. So the initial step is S -> ... two symbols.\n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t26. Let's check where t26 appears. Looking through the productions, I see NT21 -> t69, but that's not t26. Wait, no, actually, looking through the terminals, I see that several rules have terminals.

Scanning through the terminals, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> t26 (line 20: NT20 -> t26)\nSo t26 comes from NT20.\n\nSo the first token in the string is t26, which comes from NT20.\n\nNow, looking at the start rule, S produces either NT32 NT14 or NT30 NT18. So S can't directly produce t26 unless one of those is NT20, which they aren't. So perhaps the first step is S -> NT30 NT18.\n\nThen, let's see what NT30 and NT18 can produce. NT30 is defined as NT3 NT30, which is a recursive rule, so it might produce something after expansion. NT30 can also go to NT2 NT22 (line 30: NT30->NT2 NT22) or NT21 NT14 (line 33: NT31-> t69, but no, wait, line 33 is under NT30?

{"custom_id":"request-48","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's try to figure out whether the string `t22 t32 t15 t62` is generated by the given context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) use production rules to generate strings, and since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that a lot of the symbols like NT22, NT30, etc., are non-terminals, while some others like 't1', 't22', etc., are terminals. The terminals seem to be the 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nThe target string is `t22 t32 t15 t62`. Since these are all terminals, I need to check if each of them can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me see the start symbol S. Looking at the production rules for S:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nWait, each production has three non-terminals? Or no, let's count: NT30 NT32 NT14 is three non-terminals, and NT18 NT32 is two. But since all terminals in the target string are single 't's followed by numbers, perhaps the grammar allows for these to be derived.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again. The rules for S are S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, S is derived into combinations of non-terminals, each of which can expand further.\n\nNow, to generate the string `t22 t32 t15 t62`, which has four terminals. Since each production in CNF can only expand into a fixed number of symbols (usually two for non-terminals or terminals), I need to see how these can combine.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions, each non-terminal like NT22 seems to expand into other non-terminals. For example, looking at NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15. So, NT8 might produce t80, and NT15 might produce t19 or something else. Wait, no, let me check. Looking at NT15, the rules are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n- NT15 \u2192 NT29 NT20\n- NT15 \u2192 NT25 NT18\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't68'\n\nSo, NT15 can produce some terminals. Wait, actually in the grammar, NT15 has several productions: some non-terminals and some terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't68'. So, that's important.\n\nBut the terminals in the target string include t22, t32, t15, t62. Hmm.\n\nLet me try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S. The two options for S are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nI need to see which of these can lead to the target string. Let's consider the first option: NT30, NT32, NT14.\n\nLooking at NT30: The production is NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22. NT2 has production NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15. So, NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15, and NT15 can produce certain terminals.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- Starting with S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14.\n\nBreaking that down:\n\n- S \u2192 NT30 (which is NT2 NT22) \u2192 (NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15) and NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15.\n\nWait, it's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should work backwards, trying to see if the string can be reduced using the productions.\n\nThe target string is `t22 t32 t15 t62`. Let's see if each of these terminals can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT22 in the grammar: the production is NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15. So, can this NT22 produce t22 as a terminal? Or does NT22 produce two non-terminals, and thus can't directly produce a single terminal like t22?\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT22's only production is NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15, which are both non-terminals. So, unless NT8 or NT15 can produce a terminal symbol, NT22 can't produce t22 directly. Wait, but looking back at NT8, the productions are:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10, NT0 \u2192 NT22 NT5, etc. Hmm, but I don't see NT8 producing any terminals. Let me check NT15 again: NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', 't68' terminals. So, maybe NT15 can produce t15, as in the target string.\n\nWait, in the target, we have t15 as one of the terms. So, perhaps one of the NT15s in the derivation can produce t15.\n\nBut let's trace further. So, S can produce NT18 NT32, which could be further broken down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14.\n\nLet me try to break down S \u2192 NT30 NT32 NT14.\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22 (from NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22)\n- NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15 (from NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15)\n- So, NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15 (from NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT15)\n  - NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10\n  - NT11 \u2192 NT20 NT19\n    - NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n      - NT12 \u2192 NT78\n      - NT7 \u2192 NT40 (wait, no, looking back: NT7's production is NT7 \u2192 NT40. But wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-50","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string \"t69 t43 t74 t72\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form typically means that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, I see a lot of production rules. Some of them are terminals like 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71', NT19 \u2192 't1', etc. So these are terminals we can't split further; we have to use them exactly as they are.\n\nThe string we need to check is \"t69 t43 t74 t72\". Since it's a series of terminals, each token must match one of the grammar's productions.\n\nThe overall approach would be to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules. Breaking down the string into tokens, we have four terminals: t69, t43, t74, t72.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals produce these terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, let me find where 't69' comes from. Scanning through the productions, I see NT31 \u2192 't69' and NT13 \u2192 't28', but I don't see 't69' directly from any non-terminal except NT31. Wait, no, actually looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT7 is 't1', NT15 \u2192 't71', NT19 \u2192 't1', NT28 \u2192 't82', etc. Wait, looking again, NT31 is a non-terminal that can produce 't69' (as per NT31 \u2192 't69'). So t69 is from NT31.\n\nSimilarly, t43: looking for which NT produces 't43'. Looking through the productions, I see NT14 \u2192 't43'. Oh wait, no, looking through them:\n\nWait, looking again: I think I might have some confusion. Let me list the direct terminals:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I need to check for which non-terminals produce these terminals. Let me search for 't69', 't43', 't74', 't72'.\n\nFrom the given grammar, here's what I find:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n\n- Let's look for 't43'. Scanning through, I see NT14 \u2192 't43'? No, I don't see that. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't56', NT15 \u2192 't71', NT19 \u2192 't1', NT23 \u2192 't34', NT0 \u2192 't40', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't43' as a direct production. Wait, maybe it's derived from another rule.\n\nWait, maybe 't43' is part of a longer production. Let me check the grammar for any non-terminals that can produce sequences including 't43'.\n\nLooking at NT7: 't1'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't63'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't77'\n\nWait, NT27 isn't there? Or perhaps I need to see if any non-terminals can chain to produce 't43' as part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps 't43' is part of a longer production. Let me check if any non-terminals have 't43' in their production, either directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT14 \u2192 ... looking again, the NT14 rule is: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So if either of these produce a terminal, then NT14 could produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first token is t69, which comes from NT31. Then the second is t43, which I need to see.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to reconstruct a possible parse tree.\n\nThe string is t69 t43 t74 t72.\n\nt69 comes from NT31 \u2192 't69'. So the first symbol is derived from NT31.\n\nSo the start symbol S must expand to NT31 NT...? Wait, looking at the start symbol S:\n\nS can produce:\n\n- NT32 NT14\n\n- NT18 NT32\n\nSo S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nFrom the string, the first symbol is t69, which comes from NT31. So how can the first production of S accommodate that?\n\nWait, S seems to produce two non-terminals, like NT32 and NT14, each of which can expand into more non-terminals or terminals. Alternatively, S could expand into sequences that eventually produce t69 t43 etc.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the overall structure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start by trying to see if each token matches a production, and see if they can be linked together.\n\nSo t69 is 't69' which is produced by NT31. So if I have NT31 at some point in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT31 can be derived from which non-terminals?

Let me look at the entire grammar to be accurate.\n\nLooking again, for example:\n\n\"NT31 -> NT9 NT33\n\nWait, the line is: NT31 -> NT9 NT33\"\n\nIs that present? Yes, I think I see:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT31 -> NT9 NT33\n\nNT15 -> NT21 NT24\"\n\nWait, no, let me check each line carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar lines start as:\n\n...\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT19 -> 't1'\n\nNT23 -> 't34'\n\nNT0 -> 't40'\n\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of tokens separated by spaces, and each token is represented by a label like 't52', 't74', etc. My goal is to see if these tokens can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminal tokens labeled 't' followed by a number. For example, NT5 can produce 't68', and NT2 can produce 't28', and so on.\n\nLet me list the tokens in the string in order: t52, t74, t1, t28, t21.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string by replacing non-terminals with other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, according to the grammar, the start symbol S can be derived from either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Let's pick S -> NT32 NT14 as the initial step. So S becomes NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, the string has 5 tokens, so let's see if each non-terminal can produce the corresponding terminal.\n\nLooking at the first part, t52. Let's see which non-terminal produces 't52'. Scanning the grammar, I see NT31 -> t35, but wait, there's also NT31 -> NT11 NT14. Hmm, wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT31 can produce 't69', 't24', 't33', etc. Actually, looking closer, I don't see any production that directly gives 't52'. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nNT5: t68\nNT19: t1, t15\nNT7: t40\nNT23: t34\nNT20: t26\nNT9: t49\nNT17: t68, t82, t65\nNT13: t28\nNT2: t28, t80, t49\nNT30: t26, t63\nNT21: t69, t19, t33\nNT27: t77\nNT15: t21, t29, t34\nNT13 (another one): t28\nNT33: t52\nAh, here we go. NT33 can produce 't52'.\n\nSo now, the first part t52 comes from NT33.\n\nSo now, we have S -> NT32 NT14. And NT33 can produce t52, but wait, how does that fit. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, I think I got ahead of myself. Let me clarify. The string starts with t52, so I need to see if there's a non-terminal that can produce t52. Looking at the grammar, NT33 can produce t52. So, if NT33 is a non-terminal, we can use that.\n\nBut wait, S is the start symbol, which starts as NT32 NT14. So how does that fit into the string? Let me think differently. Maybe I should approach this as a parsing problem, building the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right.\n\n1. The first token is t52. I need to find a production that can produce t52. Looking through the grammar, I find NT33 -> t52. So, the first step might be to use NT33 to get t52.\n\n2. So, the next tokens after t52 should come from whatever follows NT33's productions. But wait, NT33 can only produce `t52` directly because looking at the grammar, the productions for NT33 are: NT33 -> t52. It can't produce anything else. So after t52, there should be nothing else from NT33. But the string continues with t74, so that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider different productions for NT33. Wait, checking the grammar again, I only see:\n\nNT33 -> t52\n\nNo other productions. So, that suggests that after NT33, the next non-terminals should be something that can produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me consider the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals that each produce a token or another non-terminal which in turn produces tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build a parse tree starting from the beginning.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: start from the string and see if each token can be derived from the non-terminals via the grammar.\n\nLet's try this:\n\nThe string is: t52, t74, t1, t28, t21.\n\nStarting from the end, maybe.\n\nt21: looking for a non-terminal that can produce this.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which usually makes parsing a bit more straightforward, but this seems pretty complex. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It starts with S, which branches into NT32 and NT14, or NT18 and NT32. So S -> NT32 NT14 | NT18 NT32. Each of these NTs seems to further split into other NTs or into terminal symbols denoted by 't' followed by a number. For example, NT32 can produce t75 or t74 based on the rules.\n\nNow, the string I'm given is: `t82 t59 t21 t78 t80`. That's a sequence of five terminals. I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is to two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me consider the possible derivation paths:\n\n1. The string has five tokens, so the parse tree must have four splits. The number of symbols in the derivation should start from a single S and expand to the given string.\n\n2. Looking at the grammar, each NT has two productions, except for a few that produce terminals. For example, NT22 can produce NT8 and NT0, which themselves can produce 't8' or 't6', etc.\n\nWait, hold on, the grammar has several rules that produce terminal symbols, like NT22 -> NT8 NT0, but also NT8 -> 't46' and NT0 -> 't71'. Hmm, maybe I need to reconstruct a parse tree that results in this string.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the string's terminals can be grouped into the non-terminals in such a way that all the rules are satisfied.\n\nThe sequence is t82, t59, t21, t78, t80.\n\nI can think of possible groupings. Let's see:\n\nMaybe t82 can be NT31 or NT24. Looking back, NT24 has rules like NT24 -> NT30 NT2, etc., but also some terminal rules. Let's see, NT24 can produce t72 or t74 if I look at one of the rules (NT5 -> t68, etc.).

This should make parsing easier, but I'm not an expert, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note the structure of the grammar. The starting symbol is S, which can produce either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Both production rules start with NT followed by another NT and a terminal.

For example, NT23 -> 't34'. So, some production rules directly produce a terminal. I'll make a list of NTs that produce terminals and their corresponding terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the string: t28 t78 t28 t56 t80 t68.\n\nEach token is a terminal. I need to check if these can be derived from the grammar. Let's go through each token.\n\n1. First token: t28. Looking at NTs that produce 't28'. From the list, NT13 -> t28, NT0 -> t28 (from NT22 -> t26, wait no, looking again, I see NT22 -> t3. Hmm, wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t3\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT24 -> t72\n- NT19 -> t1\n- NT28 -> t82\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT0 -> t71\n- NT24 -> t79\n- NT0 -> t43\n- NT32 -> t75\n- NT2 -> t80\n- NT12 -> t78\n- NT20 -> t26\n- NT9 -> t49\n- NT17 -> t68\n- NT13 -> t28\n- NT2 -> t49\n- NT30 -> t26\n- NT21 -> t69\n- NT17 -> t82\n- NT10 -> t42\n- NT18 -> t74\n- NT23 -> t19\n- NT22 -> t3\n- NT14 -> t43\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t40\n- NT24 -> t12\n- NT24 -> t42\n- NT30 -> t63\n- NT27 -> t77\n- NT17 -> t65\n- NT33 -> t52\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT25 -> t64\n- NT24 -> t17\n- NT17 -> t25\n- NT8 -> t46\n- NT0 -> t32\n- NT24 -> t79\n- NT0 -> t43\n\nIt looks like t28 is produced by NT13 and NT2. So, we have two options for the first symbol: NT13 -> t28 or NT2 -> t28.\n\n2. Second token: t78. Looking for NTs that produce 't78'. From the grammar:\n\n- NT12 -> t78\n\nSo, only NT12 produces 't78'. So, the second symbol must come from NT12.\n\n3. Third token: t28 again. Same as the first, can come from NT13 or NT2.\n\n4. Fourth token: t56. Looking for NTs that produce 't56'. Checking the grammar, I see no production rule where any NT directly produces 't56'. So, perhaps this token cannot be produced by the grammar. But wait, maybe it's produced through multiple steps. So, I need to see if there's an NT that can produce 't56' indirectly.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NTs that produce 't56' in a single production. So, without a production rule, the grammar doesn't directly produce 't56'. So, if 't56' is part of the string, the grammar can't generate it, which would mean the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me go through the grammar again to ensure I didn't miss any NT -> t56.\n\nLooking through all the NTs and their productions, I don't see any NT producing 't56'. The closest is NT17 -> t68, NT19 -> t1, etc., but not 't56'. So, it's clear that 't56' isn't directly produced by any NT in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-86","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t26 t68 t21 t69 t75 t22` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which should make it a bit easier to handle.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, and the production rules are all binary, each having two non-terminals on the right-hand side. This structure suggests that each step of the derivation splits non-terminals into two parts, eventually leading to terminals (letters like t26, t68, etc.).\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: t26, t68, t21, t69, t75, t22. So, it's a sequence of 6 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or a terminal on one side. Wait, actually, Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals, except for the productions that produce terminals. So, in this case, I should see which non-terminals produce the given terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can find where a non-terminal produces a terminal. For example, NT5 \u2192 t68, NT13 \u2192 t33, NT6 \u2192 t53, etc. So, the idea is to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and build a derivation tree that matches the string.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens and see what non-terminals can produce them:\n\n1. t26: Looking at the rules, NT2 \u2192 t28 in some cases, but wait, let me check. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 t26. Yes, so NT20 \u2192 t26.\n\nSo the string starts with t26, which comes from NT20. So the first part of the string, t26, is obtained by expanding NT20.\n\nNow, the remaining string after t26 is t68 t21 t69 t75 t22. So we have t68, t21, t69, t75, t22.\n\nWait, but the entire string is 6 tokens. Let me count again: the given string is `t26 t68 t21 t69 t75 t22`, so that's six tokens. So S should derive this string, which has six steps or something.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the approach is to see the structure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Both are combinations of two non-terminals.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nLet me see each option.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then each of these non-terminals needs to derive the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Similarly.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t26. Let's see if any non-terminals can directly produce t26.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 t26. So if any production of S includes NT20, that's the start.\n\nLooking at the S rules, the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So in the first step, S would produce NT32 NT14. So now, we have two symbols to derive, which will come from NT32 and NT14.\n\nSimilarly, the second S production is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So again, two non-terminals to derive.\n\nOur string starts with t26, which is from NT20. So let's see if either of these productions can involve NT20.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT32 has a production: NT32 \u2192 NT28 NT15.\n\nWait, what about NT20? We saw earlier that NT20 \u2192 t26.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, looking for NT20: I see multiple rules, like NT20 \u2192 t74, but not sure. Wait, I need to find NT20's productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7 in some cases, but wait no, no NT20 appears as a production directly into a terminal except in the rules given. Wait, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nLooking for NT20 in the production rules:\n\nWait, the grammar provided is extensive. Let me parse through to find if any non-terminal's production is t26 or t22. Wait, the rule for NT20 \u2192 t26 isn't present. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t26 is not a rule. Wait, I see NT20 \u2192 t74 is not a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7, NT20 \u2192 t26 is not present. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, in the initial problem statement, under NT20's rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT20 -> NT12 NT7\n\n- NT20 -> t26\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check the provided grammar rules again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT20, there is a rule: NT20 -> t26.\n\nYes, in the section for NT20:\nNT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\nNT20 \u2192 t26\n\nSo yes, NT20 can produce either something else or t26 directly.\n\nThat simplifies things. So our initial string must be generated by S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nIn either case, the first symbol of the string is t26, which is generated by NT20.\n\nSo, in the first case, S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, we have NT32 and NT14 to derive, which should produce t68, t21, t69, t75, t22 in sequence.\n\nAlternatively, in the second case, S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which would need NT18 and NT32 to produce t68, t21, t69, t75, t22.\n\nI think it's more likely that the first option, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, is the way to go because S in the first production starts with NT32, which can produce t68, etc.\n\nSo let's go with S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo NT32 needs to be t68 t21 t69 t75 t22.\n\nBut wait, wait. The entire string is t26 t68 t21 t69 t75 t22. So S must produce NT32 NT14, which then NT32 produces t68 followed by something that can produce t21 t69 t75 t22.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the entire derivation.\n\nLet me try to think about the string as a series of symbols that each come from a non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the production of S can generate the string step by step.\n\nGiven S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, nt32 and nt14 need to produce t68, t21, t69, t75, t22. But let's count: the string has six tokens, so from S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals, each of which must expand into multiple symbols, but in this case, the entire string is six tokens. That suggests that each of the two non-terminals, NT32 and NT14, produce a sequence of symbols that adds up to six tokens. Wait, but 32 and 14 might generate sequences of 3 and 3, respectively, making six. Alternatively, perhaps each generates three tokens. Hmm, that would make sense.\n\nWait, but the given string is six tokens, so maybe NT32 expands into three tokens and NT14 expands into three tokens.\n\nBut the given string is t26 t68 t21 t69 t75 t22, with t26 being from NT20.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe a better approach is to consider that the string is six symbols, so from S, which splits into two non-terminals, each of which can split into more non-terminals until we reach the terminals. The total number of symbols in the string is six, so the derivation tree must have a structure that combines into six leaves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by NT32 and NT14, each contributing three symbols, but that may not sum up correctly. Alternatively, perhaps one non-terminal contributes 4 symbols, and the other contributes 2, but I need to see.\n\nLet me take a step back.\n\nEach"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-102","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. Hmm, C-F grammars in Chomsky normal form (CNF) have specific structures where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. My task is to see if the string \"t68 t21 t56 t35 t63 t63 t40\" can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar and the string carefully. Let me look at the grammar rules provided. There's a list of productions, each either producing two non-terminals or a terminal. The string consists of seven tokens: t68, t21, t56, t35, t63, t63, t40. Each of these looks like a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, or a single terminal. So for a string of length 7, the derivation would require 6 steps, considering each production adds one token.\n\nI think a good approach is to see if I can build the string step by step by following the grammar's rules. I'll start from the start symbol, which is S, and try to see how to expand it into the given string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar starts with two S productions:\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, each S production leads to two non-terminals. Since our string starts with t68, which is a terminal, I need to find a path from S to t68 via the productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I'll search for terminals. I notice that NT23 has a production to 't34', but I'm not sure if it connects to t68.\n\nWait, let me look for t68. Scanning through the productions, I see NT5 \u2192 't68'. So, NT5 can produce 't68'.\n\nSo, to get 't68', the production must involve NT5. Now, looking at how NT5 is derived, the productions for NT5 are:\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nHmm, but these are both non-terminals. So, to get 't68', we'd need to reach NT5 through these productions, which would involve more steps.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two others. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each produced by non-terminals. Therefore, each step would involve expanding non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into the possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt68 is produced by NT5. So, we need to find a production path that leads NT5 to t68.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions:\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nWait, but these are both non-terminals. So, to get t68, we need to have both NT27 and NT21 derive to terminals.\n\nBut looking at NT21's productions, I see it can produce 't15', 't25', 't20', etc. Specifically, some NT21 productions are:\nNT21 \u2192 't15'\nNT21 \u2192 't25'\nNT21 \u2192 't42'\nNT21 \u2192 't69'\nNT21 \u2192 't82'\n\nSo, t68 could be part of NT5's expansion, but let me see how we can connect this back to the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this in reverse: start from each terminal and see if we can trace back to S.\n\nFor example, 't68' is produced by NT5. So, in the derivation, there must be a step where NT5 is present, and it gets expanded to 't68' along with something else.\n\nWait, but 't68' is only produced by NT5, so in the string, we have t68 as the first symbol. So, the first part of the string is t68, which comes from NT5. Then, the next symbol is t21, which could come from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals produced step by step. Let me think of the string as t68, t21, t56, t35, t63, t63, t40.\n\nEach terminal must come from a non-terminal that is derived from S. So, perhaps S expands into a chain of NTs that then produce these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire process is too involved, and I should look for alternative methods, like checking if each terminal can be part of a valid derivation.\n\nWait, another point: in the grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps from S. Since the string has 7 symbols, it's 2^6, which is 64, but the string is 7 symbols, which is 2^3 (8) minus 1, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, no, in a derivation starting from S, each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. Starting from 1 (S), after n steps, it's 1 + n symbols. So for 7 symbols, we need 6 steps.\n\nLet me count the steps: S \u2192 2 \u2192 3 ... so yes, 7 symbols require 6 steps.\n\nNow, let's consider that each step produces two symbols except when a terminal is reached.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm or some parsing table, but given the complexity of the grammar, it might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the string in the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t68, t21, t56, t35, t63, t63, t40.\n\nI can look for each terminal in the grammar and see if they can be linked correctly.\n\nt68 is produced by NT5. Let's look at NT5's rules:\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nSo, to produce 't68', NT5 must be directly expanded into 't68' or into NT27 and NT21, which would then have to produce 't68' via one of their productions.\n\nWait, but if NT5 is directly producing 't68', then the rule would have to be NT5 \u2192 't68', but in the given grammar, I don't see such a production. The only production involving NT5 is:\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\nand\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nSo, NT5 cannot be directly derived into a single terminal. Therefore, the first symbol t68 must be the result of NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21, leading to 't68' being one of the terminals produced by NT27 or NT21.\n\nHmm, so for t68 to appear in the first position, the NT5 must be expanded into NT27 and NT21, where one of them produces 't68'. But looking at which NTs can produce terminals that include 't68', I think only NT5 can. So, one of the NTs in the expansion of NT5 must lead to 't68', but since NT5's only productions are to non-terminals, it can't. Therefore, this might be impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this backward. The nt production for NT5 is to other non-terminals, so in order for 't68' to be in the string, it must come from another non-terminal that can produce 't68'. Looking back, I see that NT5 \u2192 't68' is a production, so for a terminal to be part of a derivation, it's either from a single non-terminal production or from a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. Let's look again: NT5 can be produced by NT27 and NT21, which can themselves be expanded until we get terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, NT5 has a production to 't68' (looking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, in the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT5 -> 't68'\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, there's:\nNT5 -> 't68'\nand\nNT5 -> 't19' (twice)\n\nWait, yes, the grammar includes NT5 \u2192 't68' and other productions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT5 -> 't19' (appears twice)\nNT5 -> NT27 NT21\nSo, in this case, NT5 can be either 't68', 't19', or NT27 NT21."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-130","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t28 t74 t49 t3 t33 t46 t52 t79\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies things a bit because all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals or directly produce a terminal token like 'tsomething'. The terminals indicate the actual symbols in the strings, so each 't' followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate has eight tokens, all terminals. So I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of steps conforming to the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's break down the string into its components: t28, t74, t49, t3, t33, t46, t52, t79. Since it's a single string, the derivation process should concatenate these terminals by expanding non-terminals that produce them.\n\nI'll start from S, which is at the top level. Looking at the grammar, S can produce two options: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nLet's consider both options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the string starts with NT32 and NT14 expanding into t28, t74, etc.\n\nLooking at NT32's production, I find NT32 \u2192 NT14 NT10. Wait, but NT14 and NT10 are non-terminals. So expanding NT32 would give us something else. But in the string, the first symbol is t28. So we need to see if NT32 can produce t28. But looking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT32 \u2192 t28. Instead, NT32 might lead to some chain of non-terminals that eventually produce t28.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 might produce t74. Let's check NT14's productions: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21 and NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT35. Hmm, NT31 can produce t28? Wait, NT31 produces t28, perhaps. Let me see the productions of NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 and NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT21. Also, looking at the terminals, I see NT31 \u2192 t28. So NT31 can directly produce t28.\n\nSo if NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, then NT14 might produce NT31 (which is t28) and NT21, which needs to produce something else. Let's see what NT21 leads to. NT21's productions are to NT8 NT10, etc., but wait, in the string, after t28, we have t74, which is the second token. But NT14 produces NT31 and NT21. If NT31 is t28, then NT21 must produce t74 as the next symbol.\n\nSo for NT21 \u2192 t74. Let's see NT21's productions. Hmm, I need to check the grammar:\n\nWait, looking through the non-terminals, I see NT21 might lead to something that can produce t74. Let me look at NT21's productions. From the grammar, NT21 is not directly a starting point, but perhaps through other expansions. Wait, looking through the productions, I see that NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT10? Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT21's productions? Wait, I don't see an entry for NT21 in the productions provided. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 and NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT21, which is t28 as a terminal. For NT21, the productions are:\n\nWait, I'm looking for NT21. The given productions don't seem to have an explicit NT21 rule, except perhaps via other non-terminals. Maybe I missed something. Let me go through the productions again.\n\nWait, under NT28's productions, I see NT28 \u2192 NT21 NT25 and others. Hmm, perhaps NT21 is part of a larger chain. Alternatively, maybe NT21 is derived from other non-terminals that eventually reach t74.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the other option for S, which is S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then let's see if NT18 can produce t49 and NT32 can produce the rest. Wait, the string starts with t28, but if NT18 is expanding, perhaps that's not matching. Unless NT18 can somehow lead to t28, but I don't see NT18 producing t28 directly. Instead, looking at NT18's productions, I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT5, etc. This might not be the right path because the first token is t28, not t49.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption of S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is the correct path, and within that, NT32 expands into t28, but that requires NT32 to produce t28 through a chain of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should chart out the derivation step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can reach the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of t-s and work backward from the terminals to see if they can connect through non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nLet's list the string in order: t28, t74, t49, t3, t33, t46, t52, t79.\n\nIf I work backward, each terminal must be a production of a non-terminal, and the non-terminals must connect through their productions.\n\nLet's start from the end. The last token is t79. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t79 directly? Yes, I see that NT24 \u2192 t79, and also NT17 \u2192 t79 via NT24 \u2192 NT17 NT30, but wait, the terminal t79 comes directly from NT24.\n\nSo the last symbol t79 must come from NT24. So before t79, the symbol before it is t52. So before t79, we have t52 and then t79. So t52 and t79 would come from the productions of a non-terminal X such that X \u2192 t52 t79.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, perhaps X is NT24, because NT24 has productions that include t52 and t79. Checking NT24's productions: NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32, NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20, NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT6, etc. Wait, in the given grammar, I see entries like NT24 \u2192 t79 and NT24 \u2192 t42, and so on. Wait, no, looking again, I see that NT24 has several term productions. Let me list them:\n\nNT24:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 t42\n- NT24 \u2192 t79\n- NT24 \u2192 t30\n- etc.\n\nSo NT24 can produce t42 or t52 or t79, etc. So perhaps t52 is from another production, but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Since the string is \"t28 t74 t49 t3 t33 t46 t52 t79\", and I'm considering that each token comes from some non-terminal, perhaps the string is built as a series of productions. Let's model each token and their possible sources.\n\nLet's build the string from left to right, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, the first token is t28. So NT32 must expand to something ending in t28.\n\nLooking at NT32's productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT14 NT10\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT21\nWait, but I don't see NT32 \u2192 t28. Instead, let's see from the grammar, if any NT32 production leads to t28. Scanning through the productions:\n\nI see NT32 in NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT22 NT10, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps NT32 is part of a chain that eventually produces t28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this initial path is not leading to the correct string, so maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32 is needed. Let's check.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then the first token is t49, but the string starts with t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the grammar rules. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals that eventually expand into terminal symbols (words like 't34', 't68', etc.) or other non-terminals. Since all the rules are in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, except for the top symbol S, which has two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate has 8 tokens, so I'll need to find a way to break it down into the rules provided. Let's list the tokens: t34, t68, t25, t53, t42, t21, t63, t64.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see some direct rules. For example, NT15 has rules that produce 't71' and 't35', and maybe other things I don't know yet. Wait, I also see that some non-terminals directly produce 't's like NT24 -> 't72', or NT25 -> 't64'. Let me make notes of all the direct 't' productions because that might give me some starting points.\n\nLooking through, I see that NT25 -> t64, so t64 is directly produced by NT25. Similarly, NT23 -> t34, so t34 comes from NT23. Also, NT0 can go to t71 and t94, but I don't see t68 directly. Let me check NT14: it produces 't43' and maybe other 't's. NT7 -> t1, which is not in our string.\n\nOk, so the first token is t34. Let's see what NT23 produces. Yes, NT23 can go to t34 (since NT23 -> 't34'). So starting from NT23, we can reach t34. \n\nNext, the second token is t68. Looking at the grammar, NT19 -> t68. So t68 comes from NT19. \n\nThird token: t25. Let's see, looking at NT14: it produces 't43' and several other 't's, but not t25. Wait, no. Let me check NT24, it can go to 't72', which is not helpful. Maybe NT17 can go to 't68', but that's the second token. Hmm. Alternatively, looking at NT21. Wait, no. Wait, maybe NT24 can go to 't42', which is the fourth token. But we're at t25 now.\n\nWait, perhaps t25 comes from some other non-terminal. Looking at NT25: it's directly 't64', so that doesn't help. Hmm. Maybe t25 is a result of other rules. Wait, perhaps t25 is part of a chain. Maybe NT22. Let me check NT22: it can go to 't25'. So if we have t25, it must have come from NT22, and that NT22 must have come from another rule.\n\nWait, but in the string, the order is t34, t68, t25, t53, t42, t21, t63, t64. So let's backtrack. Starting from the beginning, the first symbol is t34, so from NT23. The second is t68, from NT19. So that's part of some branch.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT32 NT32 (wait, no, looking back, the grammar is S -> NT32 NT32? Or was that another rule? Wait, according to the initial grammar, S can go to NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32. Hmm, I might have to consider that S splits into two options. Let's think about how S could generate the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a product of multiple steps from S. Let me try to construct a possible parse tree.\n\nLet me consider each token and see if I can link their origins.\n\nToken 1: t34 \u2192 from NT23.\n\nSo first production is NT23 \u2192 t34.\n\nToken 2: t68 \u2192 from NT19.\n\nSo after NT23, we go to NT19 \u2192 t68?\n\nBut how can NT23 lead to NT19? Let me check the grammar rules. Looking for rules where NT23 produces something leading to NT19.\n\nLooking through, wait, I don't see any rule where NT23 directly goes to NT19. But perhaps through other non-terminals. For example, if NT23 can produce something like NTX NTX, which then splits further. Let's see: NT23's rules? Looking at the rules, I see NT23 -> 't34' and some others, but nothing obvious that would link to NT19. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part isn't NT23. Let me think differently. Maybe the first symbol is from another rule. Looking for t34 elsewhere, I know that starts at NT23. So I think that t34 must come from NT23.\n\nSo the first part is S -> option that starts NT23. Looking at S->NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, S->NT32 NT32: that would derive two copies of NT32. But our string is 8 tokens, so maybe that's not the starting point. Alternatively, S might derive multiple non-terminals that eventually split into more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production is S -> NT23 NT32. Let me check if that's an option. Looking at the rules, S has production NT23-> 't34' but not directly. So maybe the first step is S -> NT23 NT32. Then NT23 becomes t34, and NT32 becomes some other symbols.\n\nSo NT32 can derive t32 according to one of its rules (looking through, yes, NT32 -> 't32'). So after that, the string would have t34 and t32 as the starting symbols. Then, the remaining string is t25 t53 t42 t21 t63 t64. But our initial tokens are t34 followed by t68, so this might not align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part is S -> NT18 NT32. Let's see. NT18 can produce 't74' according to one of its rules. So that's not helpful because the next token is t68.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to list all possible origins for each token and see if a sequence can be built.\n\nt34: \u2192 NT23\n\nt68: \u2192 NT19\n\nt25: \u2192 NT22 ('t25')\n\nt53: \u2192 NT1 ('t6')? Or is 53 a different t? Wait, looking at NT6: it can produce t53? Let me check. Wait, no, the rules I can recall: NT6: NT1 -> 't6', so that's t6. NT6: 't53'? Wait, no, in the rules, NT6 has a production \u2192 't53'? Looking at the grammar, yes: NT6 -> 't53'? Wait, in the rules provided, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT24 NT12\n\nNT34... wait, the last block shows NT6 -> 't53'?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This is helpful because it allows for certain techniques like CYK parsing or even manual tree construction if needed.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t28, t78, t28, t69, t82, t28, t19, t33, t12. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by examining the possible starting rules. The grammar starts with S, and the rules for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the initial expansion from S would produce either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Since the string starts with t28, I need to see if either of these can lead to t28 being the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the NTs, they all seem to be non-terminals. Let me check how they expand.\n\nLooking at NT32, the productions are:\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT25\nNT32 \u2192 t75\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT32 is part of the initial productions. Wait, let me check: for example, NT7 \u2192 t40, so NTs can expand into terminals or other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree for the string.\n\nBut that might take a while. Alternatively, I can trace the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a series of t's, perhaps each t corresponds to a terminal production, so the string is a series of productions that generate these ts in sequence.\n\nLet me note down all the production rules for NTs, some of which lead to terminals:\n\nFor example:\nNT32 \u2192 t75\nNT14 \u2192 t43\nNT33 \u2192 t42\nNT28 \u2192 t82\nNT19 \u2192 t15\nNT2 \u2192 t49\nNT17 \u2192 t82\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, let's see. The string has several t28s. So, t28 must come from some NT that produces t28. Looking in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT28 has multiple productions, some of which include t28, but let me check each:\n\nLooking through the grammar (though it's extensive), I find:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t82 (as per given rules, NT28 has several productions, but I think it's listed here: NT28 can go to various combinations including t82.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, looking at NT28, one of the productions is NT28 \u2192 t82. So that's a single production to t82. So perhaps a production that generates t28 is not directly, but maybe through other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28 is a production, but that seems problematic because it could lead to infinite loops unless it's terminated. But for the purpose of parsing, perhaps it can go to other terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for NT28:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT28 has a production:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28 (reccursively produces more NT28s, which would lead to infinite loops unless it's somehow resolved to terminals). But that's a problem because in the given string, we have t82, t82, etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar as provided, in the initial part, the user lists all the non-terminal productions, and towards the end, I see several NTs being mapped to terminals. Let me list all the terminal mappings:\n\nFrom the given grammar, towards the end, I see several productions where NT X are mapped to t Y. For example:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t6\nNT0 \u2192 t40\nNT24 \u2192 t17\nNT25 \u2192 t64\nNT2 \u2192 t49? Wait, yes, the rules include:\n\nLooking from the bottom:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT17 \u2192 t82\nNT28 \u2192 t82\nNT2 \u2192 t49\nNT30 \u2192 t26\nNT21 \u2192 t69\nNT17 \u2192 t68\nNT4 \u2192 t56\nWait, perhaps I need to make a comprehensive list of terminal NT productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to check if the string can be entirely derived from S using the given productions, possibly by backtracking.\n\nBut given that the string is nine symbols long, and each step in the grammar produces two non-terminals (since all rules are in the form A\u2192BC), so each production doubles the symbols, except when a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in context-free grammars, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So when a non-terminal A is replaced by BC, the number of symbols increases by one, as each production rule adds two symbols for each rule.\n\nWait, no: in the initial steps, each production would replace one symbol into two symbols (like S\u2192NT32 NT14, which is two symbols). So to go from S, which is one symbol, to a string of two symbols, then four, then eight, etc., but in this case, the string has 9 symbols, which is an odd number, meaning that the number of symbols must have been generated through some combination of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, the initial S can only produce two symbols, which is two Ts if those symbols are terminals. But looking at the grammar, for S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and both NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals, so those would expand, each possibly to Ts or further non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string being nine symbols long is possible, but the way the grammar expands is such that each non-terminal may expand into multiple Ts or further into more non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, I need to trace a possible derivation path that would produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree in reverse, starting from the string and trying to see if each terminal can be associated with a rule.\n\nBut that might be complicated given the number of rules.\n\nAlternatively, let me examine each t in the string and see which NTs can produce it.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t28\n2. t78\n3. t28\n4. t69\n5. t82\n6. t28\n7. t19\n8. t33\n9. t12\n\nSo I need to see if these t's can be generated from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let me find NTs that produce these t's.\n\nFrom the grammar as given:\n\nNT28 has a production to t82 (from the given, for example, NT28 -> t82?), but I might be miscounting. Alternatively, perhaps some NTs produce these t's.\n\nWait, perhaps each t is a terminal and corresponds to a specific NT production. Let me list all the t's:\n\n- t28: Maybe generated by NT28? Because looking through the rules, I find NT28 \u2192 t82 in one case, but others produce combinations. Alternatively, looking at NT28, I see a rule NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28, but that's a recursive rule, which might only produce t82 through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NTs that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT24 \u2192 't19', 't72', 't24', etc.\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. Looking at the given grammar, the later parts seem to be mixed, especially the lines where NT23 \u2192 't34' and other NTs map directly to 't<number>', indicating that some NTs directly produce a terminal.\n\nBut no, looking at the structure, the last few lines are:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT15 -> 't35'\nNT15 -> 't21'\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> 't34'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't59'\nNT31 -> 't69'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT23 -> 't21'\nNT29 -> 't28'\nNT24 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT28 -> 't82'\nNT2 -> 't49'\nNT0 -> 't71"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-162","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty complex, with a lot of rules and symbols. The string to evaluate is `t34 t43 t34 t71 t34 t80 t35 t82 t43 t64`. \n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar structure. CFGs in Chomsky Normal Form have all production rules in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form NT followed by two other NTs or terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, where S is the start symbol, and NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals. So, the initial step is that the string must derive from S through a series of productions.\n\nNow, the string starts with several 't's, which are terminals, like t34, t43, etc. These must correspond to terminals in the grammar. Let me see if these 't's are present in the grammar as terminals. Scanning through the grammar, I notice some rules where a non-terminal is immediately followed by a terminal, like NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1, or NT0 \u2192 t40, etc. So, 't's are terminals, and they appear on the right-hand side of some productions.\n\nThe string is: t34, t43, t34, t71, t34, t80, t35, t82, t43, t64. I need to check if this can be generated step by step from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to break the string down into parts that might correspond to the productions. The first symbol is t34. Looking at the grammar, t34 appears on the right-hand side of NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23, but that's more symbols. Wait, I might have to look for any production that leads to t34 directly. Let me check. For example, NT19 \u2192 t1, but that's t1, not t34. Looking further, I see NT34 \u2192 t56, but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps t34 is part of a larger production. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1, but I don't see a direct t34 there. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the presence of t34 in the productions. Let me scan through the productions again. Oh, here's one: NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6, but that's still non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check: I see that NT0 \u2192 t40, NT23 \u2192 t34, and other NTs might lead to t34. Wait, perhaps NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT1, as I thought before. Hmm, this might not be straightforward. Maybe I should try to see how the string can be constructed step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parsing problem, trying to find a derivation path from S to the given string. The string has 10 symbols, so the derivation would likely involve multiple splits and replacements. Let me see if I can parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a string derivation by trying to find if each 't' in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that can produce it, following the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look for productions that start with t's and see if they can be part of a chain leading up to the start symbol S.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t34. Looking at the grammar, the rule NT24 \u2192 t31 t6. But wait, no, wait, looking at the grammar again, I see that NT19 \u2192 t1, and NT23 \u2192 t34. Wait, but in the given grammar, the production NT23 \u2192 t34 is given. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the production is NT23 \u2192 t34. Wait, actually, in the provided rules, there's a line: NT23 -> 't34'. Or wait, looking back at the grammar string, I see \"NT23 -> 't34'\". So, yes, NT23 can produce t34. So, in that case, if the first symbol is t34, that could come from NT23.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT24 NT2 (from the first rule: S \u2192 NT32 NT14; wait, no, the first rule is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so S is split into NT32 and NT14. Alternatively, is there another rule where S splits into NT24 and another NT? Wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Wait, but none of those immediately give t34. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the initial production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the first step would involve choosing between these two rules. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, NT32 and NT14 are both non-terminals. So, each of them needs to be expanded further. Let me see what productions NT32 and NT14 have.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 t53 (as per the rule: NT24 \u2192 t72? Wait, let me check. Wait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple entries, for example:\n- NT19 -> t1\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT0 -> t40\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking for NT32. Hmm, I don't immediately see a production for NT32, but I do see NT6 \u2192 t53 and NT24 \u2192 t72. Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that the string starts with t34, which as per the grammar is produced by NT23. So perhaps the first step is that S \u2192 NT23 NT? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, the first rule S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So S expands into NT32 and NT14. Each of these would then expand into something else. But in the string, the first symbol is t34, which is NT23. So maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but maybe NT32 or NT14 can produce parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another production rule that I missed that starts with NT as the left-hand side with some symbols that can lead to the desired string. But perhaps I should consider that the initial symbols in the string may come from a different way of expanding S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the string could be constructed in a way that it's a chain of productions that eventually derive t34 t43 t34 t71 t34 t80 t35 t82 t43 t64.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if the string can be constructed by a parse tree where each step introduces the correct symbols. Let's see.\n\nStarting from S, which can go to NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nThen, let's say it goes to NT32 NT14. Now, what can NT32 produce? Looking in the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT32, but perhaps it's possible that NT32 may split into other non-terminals, each of which can eventually derive symbols.\n\nWait, but let's think differently. Let's see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t34 t43 t34 t71 t34 t80 t35 t82 t43 t64.\n\nT34 appears three times. Looking at the grammar, t34 is produced by NT23. So, perhaps each t34 comes from NT23. Similarly, t43 is produced by NT34 \u2192 t56. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, t43 would be a symbol that's a terminal, but I don't see any production where NT... becomes t43.\n\nWait, wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar again to find all the terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, the terminals are those where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal, like NT23 -> 't34' (I think that's in the grammar as a rule: NT23 -> 't34'). Similarly, other rules with 't' as the second part are:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT32 -> 't53'\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar given.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, except for some that end with terminals like 't71', 't35', etc. So the terminals (like 't's) are at the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t63 t40 t49 t12 t52 t21 t46 t82 t6 t12`. \n\nMy plan is to try to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by tracing the possible derivations.\n\nLet me list out the productions that have terminals in them. These are the leaf nodes:\n\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1' (multiple times)\n- NT23 -> 't34' or 't59' or 't70' or 't80'\n- NT2 -> 't28' or 't46' etc.\nWait, no, looking closer, some have multiple 't's. But I need to make sure I see all the terminal options.\n\nWait, the grammar has several rules where a non-terminal is directly replaced by a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT15 -> 't35'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't34', 't59', 't70', 't82'\n- NT29 -> 't21', 't28', etc.\n- NT19 -> 't1', 't15', etc.\n\nEach of these 't's correspond to specific terminals. So, each occurrence of a terminal in the string must match one of the productions that produce that terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is to look at each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet me list the string components:\n\nt63, t40, t49, t12, t52, t21, t46, t82, t6, t12.\n\nNow, from the grammar, let's find which NTs produce these t's:\n\n- t63: I'm not immediately seeing it. Let me check the productions. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT producing t63. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through all the productions:\n\nLooking for any production where X \u2192 Y where Y is 't63'. Scanning through, I don't see 't63' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, let's list all the productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT15 -> t71\nNT15 -> t35\nNT23 -> t34\nNT23 -> t59\nNT23 -> t70\nNT23 -> t82\nNT29 -> t21\nNT29 -> t28\nNT19 -> t1\nNT19 -> t15\nNT7 -> t40\nNT3 -> t1\nNT24 -> t12\nNT24 -> t42\nNT24 -> t49\nNT24 -> t79\nNT8 -> t46\nNT6 -> t53\nNT0 -> t21\nWait, I might have missed some, but I don't see t63 as a terminal. That might be an issue because the string includes t63, which isn't produced by any of the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake, perhaps the NT rules don't include t63. So if the string has t63, it's not produced by any rule, meaning the grammar can't generate it. But wait, perhaps t63 is a result of a non-terminal derivation. For example, if a non-terminal ultimately produces t63 through a series of steps, then it could be part of the string.\n\nWait, but all the 't's in the string must be derived directly from the NTs, as the grammar is in CNF and only allows two NT symbols to be expanded at each step. So any terminal in the string must be produced directly by one of the NT rules.\n\nSince I don't see a production for 't63', the grammar can't generate this string. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. Maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions:\n\n- NT15: t71, t35\n- NT23: t34, t59, t70, t82\n- NT29: t21, t28\n- NT19: t1, t15\n- NT7: t40\n- NT3: t1\n- NT24: t12, t42, t49, t79\n\nI don't see t63 in any of these. So yes, t63 is not a terminal in any rule. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the terminal 't63', which is not produced by any rule in the given grammar.

It seems like most of the non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals, except some of them that expand into terminals like 't' followed by numbers. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if the grammar produces this sequence through a series of substitutions. Since the grammar is in CNF, any derivation will consist of expanding non-terminals into two non-terminals or terminals. So, I need to see if the string can be constructed by a series of such productions.\n\nLet me list out the string: t65, t75, t72, t70, t75, t70, t34, t68, t56, t78, t53. So that's 11 tokens.

So S can expand into either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLet's take the first option: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then we need to see if NT32 and NT14 can derive t65, t75, etc.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to try to see the possible derivations. Let's see the structure of the string. The first few tokens are high t values, maybe they come from NT32 or NT14.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, NT14 is transformed into NT31 NT21 via NT14 -> NT31 NT21. Then, looking at the productions for NT31, there are a few options: NT31 can be NT11 NT14, NT24 NT21, or NT21 NT24, etc. But also, NT31 can become a terminal 't69' in some cases, but in this string, the first token is t65, so perhaps not directly.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t65. Let me check if any rule directly produces t65. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 t56, which is different. Hmm, maybe I need to find how t65 is generated. Let me check the productions for NT17, which becomes 't68'. Hmm, no, but I'm not seeing t65 directly. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t65 comes from a specific non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT17 \u2192 t68, NT13 \u2192 t43, but not t65. Wait, perhaps t65 is generated by NT34 \u2192 t12 NT1, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me check all the productions that end with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT22 can produce t70, and NT14 can produce t75? Wait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals directly produce 't' tokens. For example, NT22 \u2192 t3, but that's a single token, not helpful for splitting into parts.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to see if the string can be divided into factors according to the grammar's split. The initial S production branches into two parts, so perhaps the string can be split into two parts, each being a result of the left and right part of S's productions.\n\nSo let's assume the string is split into two halves, and each half must be generated by NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32.\n\nLooking at the string: t65, t75, t72, t70, t75, t70, t34, t68, t56, t78, t53.\n\nWait, that's 11 tokens, which is odd. Since each production splits into two, the string should have a length that can be broken down step by step. Starting from S, which splits into two productions, each of those can split into two more, and so on. So the total number of tokens would be 2^k, but 11 isn't a power of two, so that might be an issue. Alternatively, maybe not all splits are being counted correctly.\n\nWait, but the string's parts might be from a chain of splits, so perhaps the total number of tokens may not be a power of two. However, since the grammar is in CNF, each step increases the number of symbols by one (since each production replaces one non-terminal with two others, but if they are terminals, it replaces one non-terminal with a single terminal, which doesn't add symbols). Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals, unless some produce a single terminal. So the start symbol, S, is a single non-terminal which can produce two non-terminals. Then each of those would produce two more, and so on, leading to the total number of leaves (terminals) being 2^n for some n.\n\nGiven that, each production adds one to the depth, but the number of terminals can be 2, 4, 8, etc., but the string has 11, which isn't a power of two. So that suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it requires a number of terminals that's a power of two, but 11 isn't. Wait, but that might not always be the case if some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, perhaps some non-terminals can go directly to a terminal, so the expansion could produce a string with length not equal to 2^k.\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Now, each of those non-terminals could potentially expand into terminals or further non-terminals. So the overall string would be a combination of the left and right parts, each of which can be a string of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string can be split into parts where each part is the left or right side of a production. Let me try to see if the entire string can be split into a left production and a right production starting with the first symbol.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t65. Let me look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals produce t65. Looking at NT34 \u2192 t12 NT1, which doesn't directly produce t65. NT24 can produce t75, but I don't see an NT17 or NT32 in the string that produce t65. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all rules again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t65 is generated by NT23 \u2192 t21, but that doesn't directly produce t65. Hmm, maybe t65 isn't directly produced by any rule. That could mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, because there's no production that directly gives t65 as a terminal symbol. But wait, let me check all the rules again to see if any of them directly produce t65.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any that produce t65. NT17 \u2192 t68, NT13 \u2192 t75, but that's not t65. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the rules where a non-terminal is transformed into a terminal, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n- NT13 \u2192 t43\n- NT22 \u2192 t3\n- NT24 \u2192 t12\n- NT30 \u2192 t26 (as per multiple rules)\n- NT28 \u2192 t74, etc.\n\nWait, where is t65 coming from? I don't see any rule that directly produces t65. Hmm, that's a problem. If none of the rules directly produce t65, then the string can't be generated, because all terminals must come from the rules, and if t65 isn't produced by any rule, it can't appear in any string generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because NT17 is 't68', which is present in the string as the 8th token. Let me confirm: the string is t65, t75, t72, t70, t75, t70, t34, t68, t56, t78, t53.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can produce a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, every production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal (if it's the start symbol). But looking at the grammar, I see that most productions are from non-terminals to other non-terminals, and some directly to terminals, like 't26', 't64', etc. For example, NT2 -> NT22 NT15, NT4 -> 't71', which is a terminal. So the grammar allows terminals on the right side, which is consistent with CNF because the start symbol can be a terminal, or a non-terminal.\n\nGiven that, I need to parse the string from the start, trying to find a way the grammar can derive it. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to a terminal from the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens: t26, t64, t82, t84, t63, t82, t79, t26, t78, t35, t64.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S. Since the grammar is CNF, a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm could work, but since the string is small, maybe a manual approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, since each step in the derivation must produce exactly the given tokens in order, I can check if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me list the productions again to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFor example, S -> NT32 NT14. So S can produce two non-terminals, NT32 and NT14. Each of those may then produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t26, so I need to find a path from S to t26.\n\nLooking at how each non-terminal can produce a terminal:\n\nWe have NT18 -> t53? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT26 -> t78? Wait, no, NT12 -> t78, because one production is NT12 -> t78.\n\nWait, let me check the productions thoroughly.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI notice that several non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT23 -> t34, NT31 -> t69, etc. But the string has t26, which I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t26.\n\nLooking through NTx productions:\n\n- NT12 -> t78\n- NT18 -> t74\n- NT20 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t3\n- NT25 -> t77\n- NT27 -> t77\n- NT29 -> t62\n- NT30 -> t63\n- Others: need to see if any NTx -> t26.\n\nLooking at the list, there's NT20 -> t26. So the substring 't26' can come from NT20. So the first 't26' in the string could be from NT20.\n\nWait, but NT20 is a non-terminal. So to get t26 as the first symbol, we need the first production step to produce t26, meaning the grammar must have a production where a non-terminal directly produces t26. Let me check all productions of non-terminals to see if any produce t26.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT20 -> t26 (Yes, production NT20 -> t26 exists). So the first token t26 can be generated by NT20.\n\nSo the string is t26 t64 t82 t84 t63 t82 t79 t26 t78 t35 t64.\n\nIf the first t26 comes from NT20, then the rest of the string would be generated from the right-hand side of NT20's production, which is ... Wait, what's NT20's production? Looking back:\n\nThe grammar has NT20 -> NT29 NT14, and NT29 -> t69? No, wait, checking the list:\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions for NT20:\n\nNT20 -> t26 is one production, but also looking at the list, I see NT20 -> t26, but is there more?

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. However, looking at the grammar provided, I notice some rules that have terminals on the left side, like NT15 \u2192 't71' or NT7 \u2192 't1'. This is a bit confusing because in CNF, all productions should be from non-terminals to two non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure here\u2014some of the rules do have terminals on the right side, which suggests that it's actually a mix of CNF and maybe a different form. Or maybe it's a parsing expression grammar (PEG) since PEG uses terminals on the right side of the productions, but PEG isn't strictly CNF. I'm a bit confused because the user mentioned it's in CNF, but some rules have terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake and the grammar has a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps it's an augmented CNF with a start symbol that can produce a single terminal. But I'm not entirely sure. For the sake of this problem, I'll assume the grammar is as provided and proceed.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals. I'll need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules. \n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t42\". So, the first step is to see if any production starts with \"t42\". Looking through the productions, I see that NT0 can produce \"t42\" (NT0 \u2192 't21' etc.\u2014no, wait, actually, looking through all the productions, I see several rules that lead to 't' terminals, such as NT0 \u2192 't71', NT7 \u2192 't1', etc. So, I need to find a way to reach \"t42\" through a series of derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the string as a series of steps in the parse. So, each token in the string should correspond to a derivation from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me list the productions that produce each terminal string to see if they can be connected in the right order.\n\nLooking for the first terminal, \"t42\":\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT2 produces \"t80\" and \"t46\", and another rule for NT0 \u2192 't21'. Hmm, wait, let me check all rules that have 't's as their right-hand side.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for example:\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT0 \u2192 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT30 \u2192 't63'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT23 \u2192 't70'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT24 can produce 't17' or other terminals like 't56', etc.\n\nBut it's a bit hard to track. Let me see if \"t42\" can be produced directly or via a chain.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't26', which isn't helpful. Maybe NT24 can produce 't56' or 't42'?\n\nWait, no, looking through the rules again, I don't see any production that directly results in \"t42\" except from NT0 \u2192 't32'... Hmm, maybe it's not directly produced but through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t42, t43, t26, t80, t33, t63, t80, t59, t26, t3, t46, t56.\n\nLet's start from the beginning with t42.\n\nIs there a production in the grammar where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that can produce \"t42\"? Looking at the productions, yes:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't70' (no)\n- NT29 \u2192 't62' (no)\n- Looking for any NT that produces \"t42\".\n\nWait, perhaps there's a production for NT6 \u2192 't53', but again, not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the list, is there a rule for NT24 that outputs a 't'? Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't72' (wait, is that accurate?) Or perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go through the list:\n\nHere's the list of rules starting with NT24:\n\n1. NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n2. NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n3. NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT22\n4.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is in a different format. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking for NT that can produce \"t42\": scrolling through the rules, I see some that have 't's.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nHere's the rule NT0 \u2192 't43'\u2014no, 't43' again doesn't help. Looking through all the 't's:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT0 \u2192 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT30 \u2192 't63'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT23 \u2192 't70'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\nWait, I see some more:\n\nWait, looking for 't42':\n\nWait, there is a NT31 \u2192 't69' and other rules, but not 't42'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing the fact that NT0 \u2192 't32' and 't43' and 't21', etc., but 't42' is not a terminal in the grammar. That's a problem because in the string, the first token is 't42', which is not present as a terminal in any production rule. So, that's a red flag.\n\nWait, this is critical. If none of the production rules in the grammar can produce 't42' as a terminal, then it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string starting with 't42' because the start symbol S can only produce non-terminals, and non-terminals must expand into other non-terminals or terminals. But if there's no production for 't42' as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo, checking the grammar, let me see if any production directly results in 't42':\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- No NT's production ends in 't42'.\n- The only rules I've seen that produce 't's are like 't71', 't1', etc.\n\nTherefore, 't42' is not a terminal that can be produced directly by any rule in the grammar. So, if the string starts with 't42', that's impossible, because there's no production for that terminal.\n\nThis would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Am I sure that all rules are CNF? CNF requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking back, the given grammar has some rules that have mix-terminals on the right, which doesn't fit CNF. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71' \u2013 that's a terminal, which isn't allowed in CNF. So, perhaps the grammar as presented isn't actually in CNF but a mix.

CNF is useful because it's straightforward to apply algorithms like CYK parsing, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a derivation path step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol \\( S \\), the productions are:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow NT32 NT14 \\)\n- \\( S \\rightarrow NT18 NT32 \\)\n\nSo the string must start with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. The target string starts with \\( t26 \\), which corresponds to the terminal \\( t26 \\). I'll check which non-terminals can produce \\( t26 \\).\n\nLooking through the productions, I see \\( NT20 \\rightarrow t26 \\) and \\( NT12 \\rightarrow t26 \\). So the initial step must involve a production that leads to \\( t26 \\). Since \\( t26 \\) is part of the string, let's see how it can be produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, \\( NT20 \\rightarrow t26 \\) and \\( NT12 \\rightarrow t26 \\). So to produce \\( t26 \\), the derivation must come from either NT20 or NT12. \n\nNow, looking at how to get to NT20 or NT12, I'll check the productions for these non-terminals. \n\nFor NT20:\n- \\( NT20 \\rightarrow NT27 NT10 \\) (from the grammar)\n- \\( NT20 \\rightarrow t26 \\) (terminal production)\n\nSo, NT20 can produce either another pair of non-terminals or \\( t26 \\).\n\nFor NT12:\n- \\( NT12 \\rightarrow NT18 NT27 \\) (grammar)\n- Also, looking at NT27, \\( NT27 \\rightarrow NT17 NT30 \\), \\( NT27 \\rightarrow t53 \\)\n\nBut in the string, after \\( t26 \\) comes \\( t70 \\), \\( t59 \\), so perhaps NT20 is involved. Let's assume we're using NT20 \u2192 t26. Then the next part is \\( t70 \\). \n\nNow, looking at how to get \\( t70 \\). \\( t70 \\) is associated with NT23, which has a production \\( NT23 \\rightarrow t70 \\). So perhaps NT23 is involved here.\n\nBut to get NT23, we see that:\n- \\( NT23 \\rightarrow NT20 NT20 \\) (from the grammar)\n- \\( NT23 \\rightarrow t70 \\)\n\nSo, if we derive NT23, it can produce t70. So in the string, after t26, t70 could come from NT23 \u2192 t70, so the first part is NT20 \u2192 t26, followed by NT23 \u2192 t70.\n\nBut then, how do we get from S to NT20 and NT23? Let me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S can produce NT18 and NT32. NT18 and NT32 can produce various things.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 has production NT18 \u2192 t75 (from \\( NT18 \\rightarrow t75 \\)), and N13 \u2192 t28 and so on. Wait, maybe I should trace the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt26 t70 t59 t82 t34 t78 t33 t42 t15 t62 t75 t43\n\nLet me split them into their order:\n1. t26\n2. t70\n3. t59\n4. t82\n5. t34\n6. t78\n7. t33\n8. t42\n9. t15\n10. t62\n11. t75\n12. t43\n\nI'll try to find a derivation path.\n\nStarting with S, let's see which production to choose.\n\nLooking at step 1: t26 can come from NT20 or NT12. Let's assume it's NT20 \u2192 t26. So the first part is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, but we're getting t26 from NT20, so maybe the second part is from NT20?\n\nWait, actually, both S's productions start with two NTs. So to produce t26 in the first position, S must split into NT and NT, where one of them is NT20 leading to t26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making it more complicated. Let me try to see if each token can be matched by a sequence of productions from S.\n\nSince the string is 12 tokens, and each production in CNF produces exactly two non-terminals, the derivation must have a binary tree structure with 12 leaves. The number of steps would be 11, but since it's a CNF grammar, each production splits into two, so it might take multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is short enough that I can try to find a possible derivation.\n\nLet me start by looking for the terminal t26. It can come from NT20 or NT12.\n\nAssume t26 comes from NT20 \u2192 t26. Then, we need another NT after that.\n\nNext token is t70. How to get t70? It comes from NT23 \u2192 t70. So perhaps the next NT is NT23. \n\nBut how do we get NT20 and NT23 from the start? Maybe S \u2192 NT20 NT18, but we need to match the rest. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT is NT18 \u2192 t75 (from S \u2192 NT18 NT32). Wait, but t26 is the first token, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let's see which non-terminals produce the first t26, which is NT20.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT20's production is NT20 \u2192 NT27 NT10, or NT20 \u2192 t26. So if we take NT20 \u2192 t26, and then NT10, etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t26 and t70. So after t26, we have t70.\n\nSo, if t26 is NT20 \u2192 t26, then the next NT is NT23 \u2192 t70.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT20 NT23 (maybe, but S's productions are NT18 NT32 and NT14 NT32. So that might not match.)\n\nWait, no, S can't produce NT20 and NT23 at the same time. S can only produce two NTs, each of which can be converted into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT20 NT18, but that would produce sequences where first is NT20, which is t26, and then NS is NT18 which produces t75, but the second token is t70, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then the first NT could be NT18 and the second NT32.\n\nIf NT18 produces t75, but the second token is t70, so that doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first part is NT20 leading to t26, and the second part is NT32 leading to the rest of the string.\n\nSo after t26, the next token is t70, which comes from NT23.\n\nSo maybe the second NT is NT23. How to get that? Let's see.\n\nIf the second NT in S is NT32, perhaps NT32 can produce the rest including t70.\n\nLooking at NT32's production:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT3 NT32\nNT32 \u2192 NT32 NT2\nNT32 \u2192 ... (other productions)\n\nThis seems like a recursive rule. NT32 can keep expanding itself. But I'm not sure exactly how it would terminate. Maybe I need to see if NT32 can reach the needed terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and NT18 can produce t18, but that's t18. But the first token is t26, so that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is something else. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to see what the string represents. The string is t26 t70 t59 t82 t34 t78 t33 t42 t15 t62 t75 t43.\n\nLooking at the grammar"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-228","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t72 t12 t72 t77 t65 t33 t63 t52 t46 t21 t64 t3 t6`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, and there are several production rules that expand non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several symbols that eventually expand into the string tokens, like 't72', 't12', etc. But I need to see how these tokens are formed from the non-terminals.\n\nI start by identifying the production rules that expand directly into terminals. For example, some rules have 't' followed by numbers. Notable ones include:\n\n- NT24 -> t72\n- NT30 -> t63\n- NT6 -> t53, but wait, in the string, we have t72, t12, etc. Maybe not all are terminal. I need to check if the string can be derived.\n\nAnother approach is to look for connections between the non-terminals and the string tokens. I see that 't72' is derived from NT24. Similarly, 't12' is from NT6. 't77' is from NT33, which comes from NT24 via NT24 -> NT33 NT20. But wait, does NT24 produce t77 directly? No, looking back, I see NT33 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT24 has multiple production rules. One of them is NT24 -> NT4 NT1, which might not be helpful. Another is NT24 -> NT31 NT6. Hmm, and NT33 is another non-terminal that may produce 't77'.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down into these productions. Let me try to decompose the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t72 t12 t72 t77 t65 t33 t63 t52 t46 t21 t64 t3 t6\n\nLooking at the first 't72', it comes from NT24 (since NT24 -> t72). So the initial part is S -> NT24 NT14. Wait, the start symbol is S, so S can split into NT24 NT14. \n\nNow, the first part is t72, which is from NT24, so the second part must be t14. Let's see what 't14' comes from. Scanning the grammar, it looks like NT15 can produce 't14'. Specifically, NT15 -> 't14'. So possibly, after NT24, we have NT15, which gives 't14'.\n\nSo the first split: S -> NT24 NT15. But looking back, does any rule allow NT15 to produce 't14'? Yes, in the grammar, we have NT15 -> 't14', so that's possible.\n\nSo far, the string starts with t72 (from NT24) and t14 (from NT15). Now, let's check the remaining string: t12 t72 t77 t65 t33 t63 t52 t46 t21 t64 t3 t6.\n\nWait, the second token is t12, which is from NT12. So perhaps S -> NT24 NT14 expands into various components. But I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be traced through the productions.\n\nLooking again at the grammar, I see that NT24 has a production NT24 -> NT33 NT20. NT33 can produce 't77'. Also, NT20 can produce 't6' (no, looking back, NT20 is NT20 -> NT12 NT7, and NT12 -> 't78'). Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to consider the string as a sequence of terminals and see if each can be derived from the non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should parse the string backward, starting from the start symbol. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's see if each token can be connected through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the second token in the string: t12. Where does t12 come from? Looking at the grammar, NT12 -> 't78' and perhaps other productions, but I don't think 't12' is a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT6 -> t53 and NT12 -> 't78', which isn't in the string. But in the string, the third token is t72, which is from NT24.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look for any direct terminal tokens in the grammar. For example:\n\n- NT15 can produce 't14'\n- NT31 can produce 't35'\n- NT21 can produce 't69'\n- NT25 can produce 't64'\n- NT19 can produce 't1'\n- NT23 can produce 't70'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT24 can produce 't72'\n- NT30 -> 't63'\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT18 -> 't74'\n- NT13 -> 't43'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT30 -> 't23'?\n\nWait, this seems scattered. Maybe it's better to see if the entire string can be broken down recursively.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into segments that correspond to the grammar's production rules. For example, looking for 't72' followed by something, then another 't12', etc.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to use a CYK algorithm or some parsing method, but since the string is long, it's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that after t72, there's a t12, but 't12' isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar except perhaps NT12, which I don't see as a direct terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see NT12 being a terminal; instead, it seems to produce other non-terminals, except for NT12 -> 't78', which isn't in the string. So maybe that's a problem. Because t12 isn't appearing as an immediate production from any rule.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see NT6 -> t53, but t53 isn't in the string. Similarly, NT17 -> t68, which also isn't in the string.\n\nWait, in the string, the third token is t72, which is from NT24, then t12, which seems problematic because t12 isn't a direct terminal. So maybe the answer is No because the string contains a token that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps 't12' isn't a direct terminal but comes from a non-terminal that expands into it.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT23 -> 't70', which isn't in the string. NT31 -> 't69'. NT14 -> 't43'. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: the grammar seems to consist of several interconnected non-terminals, but none of them directly produce 't12' or 't77', but I see 't77' is present, which comes from NT33, which requires NT24 and NT20. But does NT24 lead to 't77'?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can't be formed because of these inconsistencies, so I'm leaning towards No.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should check if all the tokens are covered in the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the possible terminals in the string are t72, t12, t72, t77, t65, t33, t63, t52, t46, t21, t64, t3, t6.\n\nChecking these against the grammar:\n\n- t72: NT24\n- t12: Not directly in the grammar, unless a rule produces it, but I don't see it.\n- t77: NT33, which requires NT24 and NT20\n- t65: NT65? Wait, no NT65 in the grammar. Looking for 65 in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminals producing t65.\n- t33: NT33\n- t63: NT30\n- t52: NT25\n- t46: NT46? Not in the grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) have productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The grammar here starts with S and uses various non-terminals leading down to terminals like t71, t80, etc.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t80`, so I should find a production that starts with that. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that some rules end with terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't40' and others. I need to see which terminals correspond to the string.\n\nLooking at the string: `t80 t25 t79 t3 t19 t53 t74 t34 t63 t68 t68 t56 t42`. It's a sequence of terminals. My goal is to derive this sequence using the grammar.\n\nI start with the start symbol S. The grammar has two main options: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. I'll explore both possibilities.\n\nLet's pick S \u2192 NT32 NT14 first because the string starts with `t80`, which might come from NT32 or NT14. Wait, no, looking back, the productions for NT32 have `t75` and `t79` as possible terminals. NT14 has `t43` and others. Hmm, maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce these t's.\n\nLooking further down, I notice that NT32 has production rules ending with `t75` and `t79`, among others. So maybe S \u2192 NT32 could break down into `t79` followed by something else. But the first t in the string is `t80`, not `t79` or `t75`. So perhaps that production isn't the right path.\n\nLet's try the other option: S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Now, NT18 is a non-terminal. Looking for NT18's productions: I see NT18 \u2192 't68' and others. The string starts with `t80`, which doesn't match, so maybe this path isn't correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check if I'm looking at the correct NT's. For example, NT20 has a production `t68`, and so does NT18 have `t68`. The string starts with `t80`, which is higher than the t's I see in NT18 and NT18's productions, so that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I need to go deeper. Let's check the production rules for NT28. NT28 has `t82` in some of its productions, but that's not in our string. Alternatively, looking for other non-terminals that can produce higher t numbers.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the string is built from higher t's first. So `t80` could come from a non-terminal that produces `t80`. Looking through the grams, I see NT0 \u2192 't40' and NT0 \u2192 't80' (from the grammar provided). Wait, no, looking back at the production rules, I don't see that. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list, I see that NT0 has several rules: NT0 \u2192 't40', NT0 \u2192 't71', and some others, but I don't see `t80` directly. Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the productions again.\n\nLooking for NT0: I see NT0 \u2192 't40', NT0 \u2192 't71', and NT0 \u2192 't21'. The string starts with `t80`, so unless there's a production for NT0 that produces `t80`, it can't be derived directly. Wait, but in my initial glance, I didn't see `t80` in NT0's rules. So perhaps `t80` comes from another non-terminal.\n\nLet me check which non-terminals have `t80` in their productions. Scanning the list: NT27 \u2192 't77', NT29 \u2192 't62', NT33 \u2192 't52', NT24 \u2192 't12', etc. Hmm, no, I don't see `t80` as a terminal in any production. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the productions of NT20. NT20 \u2192 't68', and looking through the NT's that might produce `t80`, none seem to have `t80` directly. So perhaps the string contains `t80`, which isn't a terminal in any production, making it impossible. But that can't be because the grammar is defined, so each symbol must be a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait a second, did I misread the productions? Let's go back. Oh! I see that NT18 has a production NT18 \u2192 't68'. But that's `t68`, not `t80`. Similarly, looking for `t80`, let me check NT32. Oh! Yes, NT32 has a production NT32 \u2192 't75' and NT32 \u2192 't79', but not `t80`.\n\nWait, but the string starts with `t80`. So unless there's a way to produce `t80` from another non-terminal, this might be the issue. Let me see if any non-terminal can produce `t80` as a terminal. Looking through the production rules, the terminals are all single lowercase letters like 't71', 't80', 't25', etc. So any production that ends with 't80' would produce that terminal.\n\nLooking again at the productions, I notice NT16 \u2192 't1' and NT0 \u2192 't80'\u2014wait, no. Wait, checking NT0: I see NT0 \u2192 't71', 't21', 't22', 't69', etc. But no 't80'. So perhaps the string starts with `t80`, but the grammar doesn't have a production that ends with `t80` as a terminal. That would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a derivation that somehow leads to `t80` as a terminal? For example, if a non-terminal can eventually produce `t80`. Let's see if any non-terminals can derive `t80` directly.\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production that ends with `t80`, except NT34 \u2192 't80'? Let me check. Yes! Looking at NT34's production: NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1 and NT34 \u2192 NT1 NT36 (wait, no). Wait, actually, let me check more carefully. The production for NT34 is listed as:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't34', 't24', which is in the middle? Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar, the lines are a bit jumbled, so I might have made a mistake in recalling. Wait, the full list:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT24 NT18, NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT30, etc. Wait, I don't see a rule for NT34 ending with `t80`.\n\nWait, but looking again, I see NT27 \u2192 't77', NT29 \u2192 't62', NT17 \u2192 't68' and so on. So, no, I don't see `t80` as a terminal in any production. That would mean the string starts with `t80`, but the grammar doesn't have any production that produces `t80` as a terminal, making the string invalid. So the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string `t80 t25 t79 t3 t19 t53 t74 t34 t63 t68 t68 t56 t42` contains `t80`, but the provided grammar does not have any non-terminal that can directly produce `t80` as a terminal. \n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-245","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this task to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string I need to evaluate is `t49 t70 t32 t53 t32 t17 t75 t62 t72 t63 t78 t28 t17 t22`. Hmm, where do I even start? \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided has all the rules in CNF except maybe for the start symbol producing a mix of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, looking again, all the productions seem to either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So it's in CNF.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, each presumably corresponding to a non-terminal in the grammar. I think the process involves trying to parse the string from left to right, breaking it down into the symbols as per the grammar rules. Parsing in CNF is straightforward because each step consumes two symbols, either two terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to build a parse tree for the given string. Let's see, the string has 14 symbols. Since each production in CNF produces two symbols, except for the terminals, the string should have an even number of symbols if the entire string is generated from the start symbol S. But wait, S is the start symbol, which in CNF has two symbols when expanded, so each derivation step adds two symbols to the left. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing. In this case, the string is being generated, so each step reduces two symbols towards the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconstruct the parse tree from the given string. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t49 t70 t32 t53 t32 t17 t75 t62 t72 t63 t78 t28 t17 t22.\n\nI need to see if this can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, looking for the start symbol's productions. The grammar's start symbol is S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S is followed by NT32 and NT14, or NT18 and NT32. But in the string, the first two symbols are t49 and t70, which are terminals. But in the grammar, NT32 is a non-terminal that eventually becomes t75, and NT14 is another non-terminal that maybe becomes t19, but wait, looking through the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 t75 and NT14 \u2192 t17? Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> t75\nNT14 -> t17\n\nYes, so NT32 can produce t75, and NT14 can produce t17. So S can produce NT32 NT14, which becomes t75 t17. However, the string starts with t49 t70, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the other production of S is NT18 NT32. Let's see what NT18 and NT32 produce:\n\nNT18 -> t46\nNT32 -> t75\n\nSo S can become t46 t75. Again, not matching the string, which starts with t49 t70.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe the string starts with t49, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT1 is t6, and NT0 is t40. But where does t49 come from? Let me look through the grammar rules for any production that ends with t49.\n\nWait, I see a rule: NT24 \u2192 t53. Also, NT19 \u2192 t15. Wait, NT5 \u2192 t68, and NT19 \u2192 t15. Also, NT9 \u2192 t49 because in the grammar, I see NT9 -> t49. So, NT9 can produce t49. So perhaps the string starts with NT9 \u2192 t49.\n\nSo the string starts with t49, which would require that the first part is NT9. But where is NT9 used in the grammar? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see multiple uses of NT9:\n\nNT9 -> t49\nNT6 -> t53\nNT24 -> t42\nNT29 -> t62\nNT33 -> t52\nNT24 -> t17\nNT17 -> t68\nNT13 -> t28\nNT2 -> t80\nNT0 -> t71\nNT24 -> t79\nNT17 -> t82\nNT8 -> t46\nNT0 -> t43\nNT24 -> t42\nNT30 -> t26\nNT21 -> t69\nNT17 -> t65\nNT33 -> t52\nNT29 -> t62\nNT25 -> t64\nNT24 -> t17\nNT17 -> t25\nNT8 -> t46\nNT0 -> t32\nNT24 -> t79\nNT0 -> t43\nNT31 -> t35\nNT19 -> t15\nNT23 -> t70\nNT31 -> t22\nNT6 -> t53\nNT1 -> t6\nNT0 -> t19\nNT0 -> t84\nNT13 -> t33\nNT7 -> t80\nNT4 -> t56\n\nWait, so NT9 can produce t49 directly. So maybe the string starts with NT9 -> t49, then followed by some other symbol.\n\nBut in the string, after t49, the next symbol is t70. So t70 must be the output of another non-terminal. Let's see what produces t70.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT23 -> t70. So NT23 can produce t70.\n\nSo now, the first part could be NT9 NT23, which would parse as t49 t70.\n\nSo that's the first two symbols handled. Now, the remaining string is t53 t32 t53 t32 t17 t75 t62 t72 t63 t78 t28 t17 t22.\n\nNext, we need to see how to parse the remaining symbols. The string now starts with t53.\n\nLooking at the rules, there are several non-terminals that produce t53:\n\nNT6 -> t53\nNT24 -> t42\nNT24 -> t17\nNT17 -> t68\nNT13 -> t28\nNT2 -> t80\nNT0 -> t71\nNT24 -> t79\nNT31 -> t35\nNT29 -> t62\nNT25 -> t64\nNT24 -> t17\nNT17 -> t25\nNT8 -> t46\nNT0 -> t43\nNT31 -> t22\nNT6 -> t53\nNT1 -> t6\nNT0 -> t19\nNT0 -> t84\nNT13 -> t33\nNT7 -> t80\nNT4 -> t56\n\nSo NT6 and NT24 both have a production to t53. So the next symbol is t53, so the next non-terminal could be either NT6 or NT24.\n\nLet me think about the possible parents. Since in CNF, each rule produces two symbols, perhaps the next step is to see how to break down the remaining string into possible pairs.\n\nWait, but the next symbol after t49 t70 is t53. So that's the third symbol, which is t53. Maybe the third symbol is the second part of the production rule that produces t53. Let's see.\n\nIf the next symbol is t53, then perhaps we have something like NT6 \u2192 t53, or NT24 \u2192 t53. Let's check the rules.\n\nFrom the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> t53\nNT24 (multiple rules) but one is NT24 \u2192 t42, another is NT24 \u2192 t17, another is NT24 \u2192 t53?

Checking:\n\nLooking for NT24 \u2192 t53. Hmm, here's the rule: NT24 -> t42. So no, NT24 doesn't produce t53 in this grammar. Wait, another rule: NT6 -> t53.

{"custom_id":"request-246","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty long, with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. The string is: `t79 t63 t84 t80 t72 t26 t28 t65 t17 t34 t75 t74 t46 t84`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a specific form of CFG where every production rule is either:\n1. A non-terminal symbol \u2192 a non-terminal symbol and another non-terminal symbol (A \u2192 BC), or\n2. A non-terminal symbol \u2192 a terminal symbol (A \u2192 a).\n\nLooking at the given grammar, most of the production rules seem to fit the first form, where each non-terminal (like S, NT30, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals. However, I notice some exceptions where a non-terminal is directly linked to a terminal, like NT15 \u2192 't71', NT7 \u2192 't1', and others. These are production rules where a non-terminal produces a single terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string starts with t79, which suggests that one of the production rules must start with NT79. But wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any non-terminal symbol NT79. That might be a problem because the grammar doesn't have a rule for NT79, so it might not be possible to generate t79 at all. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting what NT79 refers to. Maybe it's a typo or misrepresentation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the production rules are all in lower case, like NT30. So perhaps t79 corresponds to a non-terminal NT79, but in the grammar provided, is there any NT79? Looking through the rules, I don't see it. All the non-terminals in the production right-hand sides are within 30s and 4s, but no NT79. So maybe the first symbol 't79' in the string can't be generated from the grammar. But I might be missing something\u2014maybe 't79' is a non-terminal that can somehow be derived from another rule?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't79' refers to a terminal symbol, and in the grammar, one of the non-terminals expands into it directly. Looking through the production rules, I see several NTs ending up as txxx where 't' is followed by two digits. Let me scan them.\n\nI notice rules like NT15 \u2192 't71', NT7 \u2192 't1', NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. So each of these non-terminals produces a terminal string. So if a non-terminal X \u2192 't84', then in the string, t84 would appear. \n\nIn the given string, the first symbol is t79. Is there a rule for some NT79? Looking at the grammar, all non-terminals are referred as NT followed by a number from 0 upwards, but I don't see an NT79 \u2192 't79' or any expansion leading to 't79'. So that might be the issue\u2014without a rule that NT79 can produce 't79', it can't appear in the string.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me list all the 't' rules to check. Here are the ones I can see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't59' (another one)\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40' again\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- ... (and others like NT5, NT4, etc., which produce terminals)\n\nSo, let me think\u2014could t79 be derived from any NT? If I can't find any such rule, then the string cannot be generated. So based on the given grammar, there\u2019s no NT that produces 't79'. Therefore, the first token in the string, t79, is ungrammatical according to the provided CFG. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 't79' is a non-terminal that can be broken down further? But in the given grammar, if NT79 is a non-terminal, we need a production like NT79 \u2192 something. Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT79. All the rules I see involve other non-terminals, but no NT79. So that would be impossible.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo or I'm miscounting. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like NT24 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't68', etc., but no 't79' unless perhaps I missed some rule. Let me go through each production:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT32, S-> NT14 NT18, etc.\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which is a left recursive rule\n- NT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6\n- NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13\n- NT2 -> NT22 NT15\n- NT1 -> NT23 NT5\n- NT24 -> NT30 NT2\n- NT4-> NT20 NT20\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12, etc.\n- NT5-> NT27 NT21, etc.\n- NT15\u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', etc.\n- NT23\u2192 't34', 't21', etc.\n- NT0\u2192 't40', 't71', etc.\n- NT23\u2192 't59'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28', etc.\n- NT15\u2192 't68'\n- NT19\u2192 't1', etc.\n- NT28\u2192 't82'\n- NT2->'t28', etc.\n- NT12\u2192 't78', etc.\n- NT20 \u2192 't26', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't49', etc.\n- NT17\u2192 't68', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nI don't see any rule where NT79 is defined. So, the production rules don't include any NT79, which would mean that the symbol 't79' in the string can't be generated because there's no rule that allows NT79 to derive to a terminal. Therefore, the string starts with a token that's impossible under this grammar.\n\nAnother possibility is that I'm misunderstanding how the tokens correspond to the non-terminals. Maybe 't79' is a non-terminal, but again, without a production rule for NT79, it can't be part of the generated string. So unless there's a way for a longer chain to reach t79, which isn't suggested here, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the string begins with 't79', but the grammar doesn't have a rule for any NT79 producing t79, so the string is not in the language defined by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-268","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t26 t19 t15 t62 t62 t70 t43 t26 t84 t75 t78 t32 t22 t84 t79` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the derived strings should start with either NT32 or NT18. From the string provided, the first token is t26, which I need to relate to these non-terminals.\n\nLooking for the possible start symbols, I see that S branches into NT32 and NT18. Since the first token is t26, I'll check what non-terminals can lead to t26. Scanning the grammar, I notice that NT13 can produce t28 and NT15 can produce t26. Let's explore this.\n\nLooking at NT13's productions: NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT28, NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28. Hmm, I don't see a direct path for t26. Wait, NT23 can produce t26. So, if NT13 \u2192 NT23 NT5, and NT5 can produce t68 but wait, NT23 can produce t19 or NT34. Alternatively, maybe NT30 can produce t26 via NT0? Wait, NT30 can produce NT2 NT22, and NT2 can lead to t22. Let me trace this.\n\nWait, looking at NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11, NT9 can produce t49, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, NT15 produces t26. Looking for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT25 NT18. Could NT25 lead to something that gives t15? Wait, NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10. Then NT27 \u2192 NT77, which seems like a terminal 't77' or it could go further, but I don't know. Maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAnother approach: the grammar's productions show that each non-terminal eventually leads to terminals, except where they produce other non-terminals. The given string has several 't's. Since each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, the number of terminals in the string should be equal to the number of steps from S down, considering each split.\n\nThe string has 15 tokens, which suggests that starting from S, each step would split into two non-terminals, and so the number of terminals would be 2^n, where n is the depth. 15 is an odd number, which is 2^4 -1, so maybe 4 expansions? But I'm not sure, but 15 tokens mean 4 levels of splitting, but the exact count depends on how many splits happen.\n\nWait, the string has 15 tokens. Let's check the grammar's initial productions: S generates two non-terminals. Each of those could generate more, and so on. The maximum number of leaves (terminals) would be 2^(k), where k is the number of applications. For example, applying the rule three times would give 8 terminals. But 8 < 15, so maybe more steps. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals generate more than two steps.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for the exact sequence. Starting from S, let's consider all possible production paths. This might be time-consuming, but let me try.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT18 NT32\nThen NT18 can produce, say, t74, but let me check. NT18 \u2192 NT26. Wait, NT18's production is NT20 NT20, according to the grammar. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I think I need to re-examine the production for NT18.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT26 as a terminal with t78. Let me see NT18's productions. Looking through the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT5. So NT18 can produce NT23 followed by NT5. Similarly, NT23 can go to t26 or t70. So if NT23 is t26, then this path can produce t26 directly.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first t26 is the first token. So if we start with S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then NT18 could produce t26. Let me check the production for NT18. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT18 directly going to t26. Let me see: looking for NT18's productions, I see NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT5, and for NT23, it produces t26 or t70.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT18 NT32, NT18 can produce t26 (if NT23 leads to t26 and NT5 leads somewhere else?), but wait, NT18 \u2192 NT23 NT5, so both have to be expanded. So let's say NT23 becomes t26, then NT5 has to expand into something else, perhaps a terminal. Looking at NT5's productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT30 or NT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17.\n\nNT27 can produce t77, and NT30 can produce NT2 NT22. NT2 can go to t28, for example. So this might be a path that eventually produces terminals. Let me see if this can lead to t19 and others.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for where 't26' appears. 't26' is in the string as the 8th token. Maybe the grammar allows 't26' to be generated. Looking back at the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 t75, NT26 is a terminal with t78, but wait, looking for NT26 doesn't seem to be a terminal; perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the grammar's production rules: for example, the first line is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the second is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, meaning it can produce more NT3s. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6, etc.\n\nWait, some of these non-terminals seem to produce terminals. For instance, looking at the end of the grammar, some have 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't68', etc.\n\nLooking at 't26' in the string, which is the 8th token, let's see which non-terminals can produce t26. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't26' or NT23 \u2192 NT70.\n- NT12 \u2192 t78 (but no, NT12 is in the grammar but doesn't produce t78; perhaps the strings have different t's). Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, the very end of the grammar has:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34', 't59', and so on, but looking through the detailed productions, I don't exactly see 't26'. Wait, let me check the grammar lines again:\n\nLooking for any production that results in 't26':\n\n- Line: NT23 \u2192 't34', 't59', 't13', etc. Hmm, no direct 't26'. But NT32 \u2192 't75', NT26 in the string is a token, but is there a non-terminal that produces t26?\n\nWait, perhaps NT13 produces t28, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree, ensuring each step leads to the correct terminal sequence.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to reverse-engineer the string.\n\nThe string is: t26 t19 t15 t62 t62 t70 t43 t26 t84 t75 t78 t22 t84 t79.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\nt26: comes from somewhere in the grammar, maybe NT23 or another non-terminal.\n\nt19: perhaps from NT19 \u2192 't1' or 't15', but looking at the grammar, NT19 \u2192 NT1 NT28, perhaps.\n\nt15: looks like it comes from NT15, which in the grammar can produce t25 (via NT23's expansion) or other paths.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure of the grammar and see if it's a linear or non-linear grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t34 t64 t79 t12 t21 t6 t40 t75 t70 t74 t19 t42 t80 t82 t75`.\n\nFirst, I'll look for any terminals in the string because terminals must directly appear in the grammar. The start symbol is S, so I'll check if the string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the terminals and non-terminals in the grammar. Some non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals, like NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5, which then can lead to 't6' or 't1' depending on the productions. Similarly, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT0 \u2192 't71', and others.\n\nI notice that the string starts with 't34', which is a terminal. Let's check if there's a production for t34. Looking through the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 't68', NT7 \u2192 't1', NT23 \u2192 't34', and so on. So, 't34' likely comes from NT23 \u2192 't34'.\n\nNext, after 't34', there's 't64'. 't64' is 't64', which I need to check. Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that results in 't64' directly. Maybe it comes from a combination of other productions. Wait, in the string, it's 't34 t64', so the first part is 't34' and then 't64'. So, I need to see if NT23 can produce 't64' and the rest of the string follows.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step, breaking down the string and seeing if each step can be matched by a production rule.\n\nAlternatively, I could represent the string as a parse tree, starting from S and expanding it until I reach the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of tokens: t34, t64, t79, t12, t21, t6, t40, t75, t70, t74, t19, t42, t80, t82, t75.\n\nI think the approach is to start from S and see if we can derive this string step by step. Let's take it step by step.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see which one could lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t34. So, let's see if t34 can come from DT32 or DT14. From the grammar:\n\nLooking through NT14 productions: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Then, in the grammar, NT31 has multiple productions. Let's check NT31 to see if it can produce t34. Looking at NT31: NT31 \u2192 NT3 NT11 or NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 or NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT21 or others. Hmm, I don't see t34 directly here. Alternatively, ND32: NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT22 or NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12, etc. Looking for t32 in the productions, I see NT32 \u2192 't75' and others. So, maybe t32 is ND32 \u2192 't75', which would be the first token, but our string starts with t34, not t75. Therefore, maybe the first production S \u2192 NT32 ... would produce t75 as the first part, but our string starts with t34, so that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the other production S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see, NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 NT5 NT25 or NT18 \u2192 NT7 NT43 or others. Maybe NT18 can produce t18, but looking through, I don't immediately see t18. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the first part, t34. Looking through the grammar, NT23 \u2192 't34' is one of its productions. So, perhaps we need to figure out how to derive t34 as the first symbol.\n\nSo, let's see where t34 comes from. The only production for t34 is NT23 \u2192 't34'. So, to get t34, we need NT23 to be derived in the leftmost position.\n\nLooking at the productions involving NT23, it's most commonly NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20. So, to get t34, perhaps NT23 is used as a non-terminal, and then further productions are applied.\n\nWait, no, because 't34' is a terminal, so NT23 must directly produce 't34'. So, in the derivation, the leftmost symbol must be NT23, and it's replaced by 't34' at some point.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation starts with S, and after some steps, a part of S becomes NT23, which then produces 't34'.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting with S.\n\nS can produce NT18 NT32 or NT14 NT32. Let's see:\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nNT32 \u2192 't75' could be from one of its productions (NT32 \u2192 't75'). So, that would make the string start with 't75', which doesn't match the actual string starting with 't34'. So, this path is unlikely.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT14 NT32.\n\nNT14 has productions like NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, perhaps NT14 can produce a string that starts with something that eventually leads to 't34'.\n\nLet's explore NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21.\n\nThen NT31 can produce several things. For example, NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11. Then NT9 can produce t68 or something else? Wait, in the grammar, NT9 has NT3 \u2192 't1', but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT27 or others. Hmm, maybe this path is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should look for 't34' in the string and see how it can be derived. Since 't34' comes from NT23, perhaps the leftmost occurrence of 't34' must be the result of NT23 being derived from NT23 \u2192 't34'.\n\nSo, the parse tree would start with S, then one of the productions must eventually lead to NT23, which then becomes 't34'. So, the string starts with 't34', so after the first symbol, we have t64 next.\n\nSo, after 't34', the next symbol is t64. So, 't34 t64'. Therefore, after NT23, we have ND23 \u2192 't34' and the next symbol is 't64'.\n\nBut how does NT23 get transformed into 't34' and the rest? That's unclear. Wait, perhaps the NT23 is at a higher level, maybe it's part of another NT. Wait, this is getting tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a series of productions applied step by step. Let me try to map out possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT32 can produce 't75', which would match the last token in the string. So, in the string, the last symbol is 't75', which could come directly from NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, maybe the last part of the string comes from NT32.\n\nSo, working backward, the last part is 't75', so in the parse tree, the rightmost part comes from NT32. So, maybe the string is ... t75, so the part before that must come from another production that leads to t82, t19, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the end of the string. The last token is t75, which is produced by NT32. So, let's see: the string is ... t75. So, the preceding token is t42, then t80.\n\nWait, perhaps the parse tree involves several steps in reverse. Let me map it out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But given the complexity, the CYK method might be time-consuming, so perhaps a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the first token, t34,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-290","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it simplifies parsing. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the starting symbol S which might have two non-terminals. Wait, looking at the rules, for example S -> NT32 NT14. So each production is of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t64 t3 t53 t79 t79 t79 t12 t40 t28 t15 t59 t64 t74 t32 t71`.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal (like 't' followed by numbers). So each token in the string is a terminal produced by some combination of non-terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar's productions. Each step should match a terminal and reduce the stack accordingly, but since I'm just evaluating, maybe I can manually check if each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if each token is present in the grammar as a terminal. Let's list all the terminals from the rules.\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals (those that appear with primes or numbers after 't') are: t77, t64, t3, t53, t79, t12, t40, t28, t15, t59, t64, t74, t32, t71, and others like t1, t2, etc. Hmm, but the string given is `t77 t64 t3 t53 t79 t79 t79 t12 t40 t28 t15 t59 t64 t74 t32 t71`. So all these 't's with numbers are terminals in the grammar. So each token in the string is a terminal that must be produced by some rule.\n\nNow, to check if the string can be derived, I need to see a sequence of productions that can generate this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the parse tree would have a binary structure.\n\nWait, another approach is to determine the possible sentences that the grammar can generate. Perhaps the terminals correspond to certain non-terminals, and by following the rules, I can see if the entire string can be covered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 't' token corresponds to specific non-terminals, and the string must be a concatenation of their productions.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example, NT31 -> t69, so if a 't69' is in the string, it must come from NT31.\n\nWait, but the string given has t79 three times. Let's check what's producing t79. Looking at the rules, NT4 -> NT73 NT6? Wait, no, looking back, I think I might be mixing up.\n\nWait, let me look through all the rules again. I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT4 NT1, and NT4 can produce multiple things, including t68, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map each terminal to the possible non-terminals that produce them. For example:\n\nt77 is produced by NT31 (from NT31 -> t69, but wait no, looking through, I see NT31 -> NT9 NT11, which then must go through other rules to produce 't's. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to see if each 't' in the string is produced by some terminal production, and check if the sequence can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the parsing process would involve reducing symbols step-by-step.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t77. So t77 must be a terminal, and looking at the rules, I see that t77 is produced by NT33 (looking at NT33 -> NT22 NT11, and NT22 -> NT6 NT18, and so on). Wait, perhaps not. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, t77 is mentioned in two productions:\n\nNT33 -> NT22 NT11\n\nNT31 -> NT11 NT14\n\nWait, and NT14 is a production like S -> NT32 NT14. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, t77 seems to be produced by NT33 and NT31. Let me check:\n\nLooking through, the only production that includes t77 is:\n\n- NT33 -> NT22 NT11\n\nAnd also, NT31 -> NT9 NT11\n\nWait, no. Looking back, perhaps t77 is produced by NT22? Because NT22-> t3? Wait, no, wait:\n\nLooking through, for example, NT30 -> nt2 nt22, and nt22 -> nt6 nt18, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can note which non-terminals produce the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- t3 is produced by NT3 (S-> NT30 NT32 etc.)\n- t53 is not directly a terminal? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the 't's are directly the terminals. So each 't' in the string must be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT3 -> t1, NT7 -> t40, etc. Wait, but in the string, t3 appears. So, is there a non-terminal that produces t3? Looking at the rules, perhaps looking for 't3' in the productions.\n\nWait, looking through, I notice that somewhere in the rules, NT30 -> NT2 NT22, and NT22 -> NT8 NT0, NT3 -> t1, etc. But I need to find a rule that ends with t3.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> nt8 nt0\n\n- NT7 -> t40\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way to proceed is to check each 't' in the string and see if it's a terminal in any production.\n\nSo looking at the string: t77, t64, t3, t53, t79, t79, t79, t12, t40, t28, t15, t59, t64, t74, t32, t71.\n\nI need to see if each of these is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- t77: From looking at the rules, I see NT33 -> NT22 NT11, and maybe NT33 can produce t77 somehow. But looking through all the productions, I don't immediately see a t77 directly. So perhaps t77 comes from NT33 -> something that can reduce to t77, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for each 't' and see if it's a terminal in the grammar. From the rules, I see:\n\n- t77 appears in NT33->NT22 NT11\n\n- t64 in NT25->nt27 t64\n\n- t64 again.\n\n- t3, as in `t3`, in NT3.\n\n- t53: Not sure, looking through, maybe NT24->nt4 t53?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or terminals on the right. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. I notice that most rules are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, like S -> NT32 NT14. Some of them lead directly to terminals, like NT15 -> 't71' or NT31 -> 't69'. These are the leaf nodes of the parse tree and correspond to the terminal symbols in the string.\n\nThe string given has 17 tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal symbol, which in this grammar are all the 't' followed by a number, like 't63', 't71', etc. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. This implies that any parse tree for a string generated by this grammar will have a binary structure. That is, the length of the string should be equal to the number of leaves in such a tree, which is one less than a power of two. Wait, no, actually, in CNF grammars, the maximum length of a string is 2^(n-1) for a derivation of n symbols. But maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nAlternatively, I should consider the number of non-terminals and how the string is constructed. Each rule either produces two non-terminals (which can be further expanded) or a terminal. So, the total number of symbols in the string corresponds to how many leaves are in the parse tree. \n\nGiven the string has 17 tokens, let's check if 17 is a possible number of leaves in a binary tree derived from a CNF grammar.\n\nWait, in a binary tree, the number of leaves is related to the number of internal nodes. The number of leaves L must satisfy L = I + 1, where I is the number of internal nodes. But in this case, each production is binary, so each internal node has exactly two children. \n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the string as a sequence of terminals that must be generated by a leftmost derivation. Alternatively, I can consider the fact that the number of symbols in the string is 17. Each production, except for the ones that produce terminals, reduces the number of symbols by one because each rule replaces one non-terminal with two other symbols. So, starting from S, each expansion increases the number of symbols by 1. \n\nWait, the initial string size starts at 1 (S). Each leftmost expansion replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, so the count goes up by 1 each time. Therefore, for the string to have 17 symbols, the number of productions used must be 16, because 1 + 16 = 17.\n\nBut this approach might complicate things. Maybe I should look for specific patterns in the string or see if there's any rule that directly produces a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first three tokens are 't63', 't71', 't26'. Let's see if any rule directly produces these. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT14 NT23\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT18\n- NT5 -> NT27 NT21\n- NT5 -> NT19 NT17\n- Other rules produce terminals.\n\nWait, but none of the production rules for non-terminals directly produce 't63', 't71', etc. Instead, all the rules that produce terminals are of the form like NT15 -> 't71'. So, in the string, 't71' appears, which could come from NT15 -> 't71'. Similarly, 't63' comes from NT27 -> 't63' (because looking at the grammar, 'NT27 -> NT6 NT5', and in the grammar, NT6 -> 't53'? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me cross-reference. \n\nThe grammar has lines like:\n- NT27 -> NT6 NT5\n- NT6 is further expanded to NT18 NT27, and so on. But in the terminals part, some rules directly produce 't's. \n\nFor example:\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT23 -> 't19' (wait, looking at the grammar, I see 'NT15 -> 't71'; NT24 -> 't42'; NT27 -> 't53'; etc.)\n\nWait, no, looking back, the grammar rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT23 -> 't19'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT14 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't1'\nNT8 -> 't46'\nNT0 -> 't32'\nNT24 -> 't17'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT24 -> 't42'\nNT17 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't28'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't80'\nNT12 -> 't78'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't49'\nNT17 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't28'\nNT2 -> 't49'\nNT30 -> 't26'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT17 -> 't82'\nNT10 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't74'\nNT23 -> 't19'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT14 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT24 -> 't12'\nNT24 -> 't42'\nNT30 -> 't63'\nNT27 -> 't77'\nNT17 -> 't65'\nNT33 -> 't52'\nNT29 -> 't62'\nNT25 -> 't64'\nNT24 -> 't17'\nNT17 -> 't25'\nNT8 -> 't46'\nNT0 -> 't32'\nNT24 -> 't79'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT23 -> 't70'\nNT31 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't53'\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't19'\nNT0 -> 't84'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't56'\n\nWait, so each production either has two terminals, like NT27 -> 't63' NT26 (but wait, no, perhaps I need to find where the non-terminals lead to terminals).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar could be represented as a series of rules where each non-terminal eventually resolves to a sequence of terminals. To check the string, I can try to see if it can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nA possible approach is to simulate a top-down parsing or bottom-up. Given that the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might be used, but I'm more comfortable with looking for possible leftmost derivations.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for parts of the string and see if they can be generated.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt63 t71 t26 t70 t1 t21 t80 t22 t84 t46 t3 t22 t35 t43 t70 t1\n\nLet me split it into individual tokens and map each to non-terminals:\n\nt63: comes from NT27 -> 't63' NT26?\n\nWait, wait. Looking back at the grammar, do I have any rule where a non-terminal on the left leads directly to 't63'? \n\nNo. All the rules that produce 't's have non-terminals on the left and 't's on the right. So, for each 't' in the string, it's the result of a production where the non-terminal on the left ends up in that position.\n\nFor example, 't63' comes from NT27 -> 't63' NT26. But wait, that would mean that the rule is NT27 -> 't63' NT26. But looking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT27 -> NT6 NT5\n\nSo, NT27 is not a terminal, it's a non-terminal that expands into two non-terminals, and thus no direct production to 't's.

{"custom_id":"request-303","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, so first, I should recall what a context-free grammar is and what Chomsky normal form entails. From what I remember, Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Oh, wait, but looking at the grammar, I see some rules that might not be in CNF, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14. That seems to have two non-terminals, so maybe I need to check if all production rules have at most two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nWait, the user said it's given in CNF, so I guess I don't have to worry about the form. The grammar defines a language, and I need to determine if the string `t26 t53 t72 t62 t70 t52 t82 t68 t32 t32 t52 t74 t17 t12 t15 t32 t15` is part of that language.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and breaking it down. It's a sequence of t-terms like t26, t53, etc. Each of these terms must be derived from the grammar's production rules. The non-terminals are things like S, NT32, NT14, and so on. The terminals are these t numbers.\n\nI should probably look for the start symbol S in the string. The string starts with t26, so I need to see how 't26' could be derived. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT22 \u2192 't3' and other terminals. Hmm, but looking at the string, the first term is t26. Let's check if any production rule leads to t26 as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT20 \u2192 't26' when NT20 is a non-terminal. So if NT20 can be derived to produce t26, that could be part of the string.\n\nNow, let's see how the string can be broken down step by step. The string is: t26 t53 t72 t62 t70 t52 t82 t68 t32 t32 t52 t74 t17 t12 t15 t32 t15.\n\nGiven that the start symbol is S, which can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So each S production would split into two non-terminals, which then can be further expanded.\n\nWait, but the grammar seems quite extensive with many non-terminals and their production rules. It might be helpful to parse the string using a top-down or bottom-up approach. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by breaking it into sub-strings that match the production rules.\n\nLet me try a top-down approach. Starting with S, perhaps applying a production rule that leads to the terms in the string.\n\nBut this seems complicated because the string is quite long. Maybe I should look for production rules that directly produce the given terminals and see if they fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reconstruct the parse tree for the given string.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't26' (as before)\n- Let's check for the other terminals in the string:\n  - t53: Looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't53' (Wait, actually, in the grammar, it's NT6 \u2192 't53' or not? Wait, in the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't68', NT17 \u2192 't68', etc., but looking through the production rules for terminals, I see that NT17 \u2192 't68', NT20 \u2192 't26', but I don't immediately see a rule that produces 't53'. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6, I see \"NT6 \u2192 't53'\". Let me confirm: Yes, in the rules, there are entries like NT6 \u2192 't53'.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's check again. In the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't53'\nNT17 \u2192 't68'\nNT20 \u2192 't26'\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 't53', so t53 is produced by NT6.\n\nSimilarly, t72: Looking for rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't56', but not t72. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, looking through the non-terminals and the rules, perhaps some non-terminals derive to multiple terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some production rules lead to sequences of terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and each of NT32 or NT14 could derive to sequences that include the given t terms.\n\nBut this seems too time-consuming, and the string is quite long.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that in the given string, let's see if each term is a direct terminal in some rule.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t26 is produced by NT20 (Production: NT20 \u2192 't26')\n- t53: NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- t72: Looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't72' via a rule: NT24 \u2192 't72'? Or is t72 a terminal? Wait, looking back at the rules, under NT24, I see several rules, some producing other non-terminals and some producing terminals, but let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT24, I see \"NT24 \u2192 't72'\", yes. So t72 is produced by NT24.\n\nt62: Looking at the rules, does any non-terminal produce 't62'? Yes, NT26 \u2192 't62' (Wait, no, checking the given rules, I don't see a rule for NT26.

So each production in the grammar should follow S \u2192 AB or S \u2192 a, where A, B are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most rules are of the form NTn \u2192 NTm NTk or NTn \u2192 a, where a is a terminal like 't' followed by a number, or some other symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals producing two symbols. Similarly, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which seems a bit odd because it's producing two non-terminals but not terminals. Wait, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. That seems okay because it's two non-terminals. The next is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Also fine. But then, looking further, I see rules like NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. Wait a second, isn't that a production that's producing two non-terminals? Because NT3 and NT30 are both non-terminals. But in my notes, in Chomsky normal form, the right-hand side can be two non-terminals, which is acceptable. So that's okay.\n\nBut looking more carefully, I see that some of the rules produce a terminal symbol. For example, later in the grammar, there are instances where non-terminals produce terminals with 't' like nt13 \u2192 't28'? Wait, let me see. Looking at the grammar, I see lines like NT15 \u2192 't71', NT15 \u2192 't35', etc. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 't34', and others are 't' followed by a number. Also, some lines have NT? \u2192 't' followed by numbers. \n\nSo, all the production rules are either of the form NTn \u2192 NTm NTk or NTn \u2192 'tX'. That's fine for CNF because in CNF, each production produces either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So yes, the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is: `t63 t33 t64 t65 t80 t25 t46 t70 t17 t59 t21 t42 t80 t33 t33 t17 t75`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has 17 elements. The grammar can generate strings with an even number of symbols if there's an even number of non-terminals in the productions. However, since S is the start symbol and each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the length of the string must match the number of steps taken during the derivation. \n\nWait, no, actually, in a context-free grammar, the length of the string can vary. But in this case, the production rules may lead to varying lengths. However, I might need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string using the grammar rules. That is, I can check if each terminal symbol in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and see if the sequence of symbols can be built up by the grammar.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. Each symbol starts with 't', which is a terminal. So each 't' must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 17 't' symbols with numbers. Let's list the sequence:\n\n1. t63\n2. t33\n3. t64\n4. t65\n5. t80\n6. t25\n7. t46\n8. t70\n9. t17\n10. t59\n11. t21\n12. t42\n13. t80\n14. t33\n15. t33\n16. t17\n17. t75\n\nSo each of these is produced by some non-terminal. Let's look at each 'tX' and find out which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- nt15 \u2192 't71', 't35'\n- nt13 \u2192 't28'\n- etc.\n\nWait, let me create a mapping of non-terminals to their terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't5', 't70' (Wait, no, looking more carefully, some lines have NT23 \u2192 't34', others 't' plus numbers. So, NT23 can produce 't34' (from NT24 \u2192 't34' rule?), maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list each rule more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to list each non-terminal and their possible productions.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n...\nContinuing:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30 (so it's a recursive production; thus, it can produce an arbitrary number of NT3's followed by NT30)\nNT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6\nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13\nNT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15\nNT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5\nNT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT20\nNT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\nNT22 \u2192 NT8 NT0\nNT13 \u2192 NT10 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\nWait, I'm seeing that NT24 has multiple rules, some producing two non-terminals, others producing terminals. For example, NT24 can produce NT2 NT13 or other NT combinations, but also can produce 't32' (from the line NT24 \u2192 't32'). Similarly, other NTs may have rules that produce terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to figure out which non-terminals can produce each 'tX' in the string.\n\nSo, each 'tX' must be produced by some non-terminal NT. Let's see:\n\n- t63: Looking through the rules, find any NT where 't63' is a terminal. Scanning the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 't69' and others, but where is 't63' produced? Wait, in the rules I see NT23 \u2192 't34', NT31\u2192 't24', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to check all the rules for 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the entire grammar, I find that:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', 't35'\nNT13 \u2192 't28'\nNT23 \u2192 't34', 't5', 't70' (from the rules NT23 \u2192 't34', NT27 \u2192 't12', etc. Wait, no: Looking through, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', NT27 \u2192 't77', NT7 \u2192 't40', NT24 \u2192 't17', NT17 \u2192 't68', etc. Hmm, perhaps it's not easy. Maybe I should cross-reference each non-terminal to see if any produce a particular 'tX'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by constructing the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the string can be generated starting from S, using the grammar.\n\nLet me start by seeing if the first symbol 't63' can be generated. I need to find a non-terminal NT that can produce 't63'. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT rule where 't63' is a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me scan all the lines again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't69', 't24', 't63' (from NT31 \u2192 't63', NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc. Wait, I might have to check carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar lines are as follows:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 't69' (from line NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 and NT11?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because CNF has specific structures that might make parsing easier. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most rules are in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which fits the CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t25 t33 t12 t79 t25 t40 t33 t42 t22 t64 t17 t59 t75 t53 t17 t19 t28`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminals. My job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar, meaning that starting from the start symbol S, applying productions step by step will lead to this string, with all non-terminals being expanded into terminals.\n\nStarting from S, I need to see how the string can be derived. The grammar's start symbol is S, which has two production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2.

I need to see if any production starting with NT49 exists. Scanning through the grammar, I find that NT25 \u2192 t64, and NT17 \u2192 t68, but it seems that t49 is a terminal that might come from a specific NT. Wait, looking again, in the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 NT18 NT27, and NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21, but nothing directly leading to t49.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t77 t32 t77 t56 t6 t3 t62 t25 t72 t64 t19 t22 t59 t21 t34 t19 t71 t68`.\n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form works. CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and start symbols must not be on the right-hand side. Additionally, the grammar must not have any productions that produce the empty string, which seems to be the case here because all productions have non-terminals on the right.\n\nBut here, I notice that some of the symbols in the grammar are actually terminal symbols because they map directly to 't' followed by numbers, which are part of the target string. For example, there are rules like NT15 \u2192 't35', NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. So, this grammar isn't in pure CNF because some productions have terminals on the right-hand side. Hmm, wait, actually in standard CNF, all productions are non-terminals, so maybe in this case, the grammar has been converted to have terminal symbols as part of the RHS, perhaps because of how the productions are set for generating terminal strings. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think: in standard CNF, all productions produce non-terminals, but if a symbol is allowed to produce a terminal, then the grammar is left in CNF with such productions.\n\nWait, I think the problem might have been presented with the grammar in CNF where some non-terminals produce terminals, so that a production can have a terminal on the RHS. So, it's a mix of non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side, but it's still CNF since the non-terminals are the only ones on the left.\n\nNow, the string given is `t77 t32 t77 t56 t6 t3 t62 t25 t72 t64 t19 t22 t59 t21 t34 t19 t71 t68`, which is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the task is to see if this sequence is a possible output of the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can try to parse the string using the grammar rules.\n\nI think the approach here is recursive descent parsing or using a top-down parsing strategy. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, any pushdown automaton that the grammar can recognize can be simulated with a stack-based approach.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to look up the structure of the grammar and see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that most non-terminals are defined in terms of other non-terminals, and some directly produce terminals like 't77', 't32', etc.\n\nLet me list out the rules that produce terminal symbols:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't43', 't71', 't23' (wait, I think I need to check each rule for NT0)\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I can find where the non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT24 \u2192 't12', 't42', 't79', etc. Wait, let me check each rule one by one.\n\nActually, looking through all the rules provided, here are the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't43', 't71', 't23', 't32', 't77' (looking at the rules for NT0)\n- NT19 \u2192 't15', 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72', 't25', 't17', 't29', 't64', 't79', etc.\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at each non-terminal:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT6 \u2192 't53' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT1 \u2192 't6' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't43', 't71', 't23', 't32', 't77' (multiple terminals).\n- NT19 \u2192 't15', 't33'.\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'.\n- NT22 \u2192 't3' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT24 \u2192 't12', 't42', 't79', 't29', etc., which are all terminals.\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT7 \u2192 't40' \u2192 terminal.\n- NT24 \u2192 't72', 't25', etc., some are not terminals? Wait, no, in the production of NT24, like NT24 \u2192 NT27 NT10 is a rule, but there are other rules where NT24 \u2192 terminal, like 't12', 't42', etc. So, the non-terminals can produce both non-terminals and terminals. So, for example, NT24 can be a symbol that can derive both NT27 NT10 and terminals like t12, t42, etc.\n\nThis is getting a bit complex. Since the string is quite long, perhaps I should try to find where the terminals are produced and see if the structure makes sense.\n\nLet's take the string and break it into the individual steps each symbol is produced.\n\nThe string is: t77 t32 t77 t56 t6 t3 t62 t25 t72 t64 t19 t22 t59 t21 t34 t19 t71 t68.\n\nSo, each symbol is linked to a production in the grammar. Let's see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, let's see:\n\n- t77: Where is 't77' produced? Looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't74' is one, but that's 't74' not 't77'. Wait, let's check each production that has a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, here are the productions that result in terminals:\n\n1. NT24 \u2192 't77'\n2. NT24 \u2192 't56'\n3.

NT0 \u2192 't40', 't43', 't71', 't23', 't32' (is that correct?)\nWait, looking back, the rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT23 NT18\n...\nLooking further in the provided grammar, there are rules like NT0 -> 't40', but I might have to list them all.\n\nWait, actually, maybe a better approach is to list all the rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol. Let me scan through the given grammar:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT32: Both are non-terminals, no terminal.\n- S -> NT18 NT32: Both non-terminals.\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30: NT3 is a non-terminal.\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT6: Both non-terminals.\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT13: Both non-terminals.\n- NT2 -> NT22 NT15: Both non-terminals.\n- NT1 -> NT23 NT5: Both non-terminals.\n- NT24 -> NT30 NT2: Both non-terminals.\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT20: Both non-terminals.\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12: Both non-terminals.\n- NT5 -> NT27 NT21: Both non-terminals.\n- NT5 -> NT19 NT17: Both non-terminals.\n- NT22 -> NT8 NT0: Both non-terminals.\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT28: Both non-terminals.\n- NT28 -> NT28 NT28: Both non-terminals, but this is a recursive production, but in CNF, it's allowed.\n- NT24 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-343","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t25 t49 t75 t75 t17 t62 t69 t52 t62 t43 t79 t82 t52 t42 t1 t63 t80 t40 t68`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. CNF is useful for parsing with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm dealing with this manually, I'll try to find a path through the grammar that generates the given string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The S productions are:\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, any string generated by this grammar starts with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. The string in question starts with t25, which looks like a terminal symbol. Let's check if any of these productions start with a terminal. \n\nLooking at the productions, the NT32 in S's first production could potentially be a terminal if it's defined as such. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT32 appears as a terminal in multiple places, including t75 (from NT7), t24 (from NT24 -> t42 and others), t32 (from NT0 -> t32), etc. But in the production NT32, I don't see it being further expanded; it's just a symbol. So, perhaps NT32 is a terminal symbol, but in the string, the first part is t25. Wait, that doesn't match, because S would start with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, meaning the first symbols should be t-something, not t25.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again. Looking through the NT32 productions, I see that NT0 -> t32, and NT7 -> t40, etc. NT32 itself isn't a terminal; it's a non-terminal with productions like NT32 -> NT24 NT17 (from NT24 -> NT7 NT32, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for where t25 appears.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t25. In the grammar, I see that NT25 has productions that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT25 -> NT27 NT10. Then NT27 -> NT17 NT21, and so on. But maybe I can build the string from the start. Let me think about the possible expansion of S.\n\nSince S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, let's see if the string starts with any of these NT32 or NT18. \n\nLooking at the productions, NT32 can produce t25 in some cases, but let's check. Let's say S expands to NT32 NT14. Then NT32 would produce something, possibly leading to t25. But I need to see how the productions can lead to the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed by expanding the non-terminals step by step. Let me try to see if t25 can be part of the generated string.\n\nLooking through the productions for t25, I see that NT25 can eventually produce 't' terminals. For example, NT25 -> NT27 NT10, and then NT27 -> NT17 NT21, and so on. Let's see if this chain can lead to t25 at any point.\n\nWait, actually, in the given string, the first token is t25. So, perhaps the derivation starts with a production that directly expands to t25? Or perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nLooking at NT24, I see a production that goes to NT45 or something? Wait, looking through, I see that some non-terminals are defined to produce terminals like 't7' etc. But I'm not sure. Let me try to map this out more clearly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to find a path from S to the given string. The string has 20 tokens, each a 't' followed by a number. So, we need to see if the grammar can generate exactly these 20 terminals.\n\nStarting from S, the first two symbols would be from either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\nNow, NT32 could lead to certain terminals. Looking through the productions, NT32 is involved in multiple rules, but it's not directly defined as a terminal. For example, NT32 appears in NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT25 (which might lead to terminal tokens), as well as in NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT2, and others. But none of these immediately produce t25 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the string's first token, t25. Let's see if any rule leads to t25. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't68' (from NT5 -> 't68')\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- And others like NT15 -> 't35', etc.\n\nBut perhaps more directly, I should track down how a non-terminal could expand into t25. Let me look for any rule where 't25' is the result of expanding a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT24 -> 't42' (from NT24 -> NT4 NT32 where NT4 is 't56' perhaps, but no. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT4 -> 't56', but also NT24 -> NT7 NT32 (from NT24 -> NT4 NT20? Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should list all the rules that result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- S productions: NT32, NT14, etc.\n- NT32 appears in several productions, but not directly as a terminal.\n- NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT25 (so if NT25 is a terminal, it would generate 't25'\n- Looking further, NT25 -> NT27 NT10, and NT27 -> NT17 NT21, NT17 -> NT19 NT30, and so on. So this seems like it would produce a longer string of terminals.\n\nBut the given string starts with t25, which might mean that a non-terminal directly produces it. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any NT that in one step produces t25. For example, NT25 has a production to t25? Wait, no, in the given grammar, I don't see any direct expansion of a non-terminal to 't25'. So perhaps 't25' is the result of a longer derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's generated through several steps. Let's think about the string 't25 t49 t75 t75 t17 t62 t69 t52 t62 t43 t79 t82 t52 t42 t1 t63 t80 t40 t68'.\n\nHmm, the string starts with t25, which is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar has a production that directly leads to t25, or the derivation includes t25 as an intermediate step.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT1 is 't6', NT7 is 't40', NT24 has some 't' terminals in its productions, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string can be built by a series of derivations.

{"custom_id":"request-342","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is `t84 t53 t68 t43 t71 t21 t56 t53 t62 t40 t17 t49 t77 t15 t22 t70 t43 t33 t25`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form looks like. A CFG is in Chomsky normal form if each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to fit that structure since all productions have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. So the grammar is correctly given.\n\nNow, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive this string using the given productions. The string starts with `t84` and ends with `t25`, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol. I need to see if these terminals can appear in the correct order when applying the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to look at the grammar's productions and see which ones can produce terminal sequences that match the string. Let's break down the string into individual terminals: t84, t53, t68, t43, t71, t21, t56, t53, t62, t40, t17, t49, t77, t15, t22, t70, t43, t33, t25.\n\nI should also note that some non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals, as indicated in the grammar. For example, S can produce NT32 NT14, and looking back, NT32 is 't75' and NT14 is 't43'. But wait, the string starts with t84, so perhaps the initial S needs to expand differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a production that can eventually lead to the first 't84'. Looking through the rules, NT15 can be 't35' or 't68' or 't43'. Hmm, but the string starts with t84. So I need to find a path from S down to 't84'.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's see where these go.\n\nNT32 can be 't75' from NT30 -> NT2 NT22 (but wait, NT30 isn't just NT2 NT22; NT30 specifically maps to 't26' if looking back\u2014wait, no, the grammar's rules require careful checking. Wait, in the grammar, NT30 can only produce NT3 NT30 and NT30 \u2192 NT22 NT2. Wait, looking at the grammar, under NT30, the production is NT30 -> NT3 NT30, and another production: wait, checking the grammar rules:\n\nWait, the user input had grammar rules like:\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT4 -> NT25 NT6\n... and so on.\n\nBut in the terminal mappings, under NT0, NT24, etc., some of them have specific mappings. So, for NT30, looking in the rules, I see NT30 -> NT3 NT30, but in the terminal outputs, do any NTX produce a terminal like t26?\n\nWait, looking through the terminal mappings:\n\nFor example, NT25 -> 't64', NT24 -> 't17', etc.\n\nWait, but the initial string starts with t84. So perhaps the first production is looking at NT32 and NT14. NT32 could be 't75' or maybe another path? Wait, from NT32: looking at the grammar, under NT32, perhaps NT32 has a production leading to something else. Wait, no, NT32's productions in the grammar include:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> ...\nWait, no, in the initial grammar, the rules for NT32 and others seem to be:\n\nLooking at the user input, starting with \"Grammar: S -> NT32 NT14\" and other similar rules. Then, for NT32, I need to see if any of the production rules for NT32 end in a terminal. Looking through all entries, in the terminal mappings:\n\nNT32: in the terminal definitions, I see NT30 -> 't26', NT2 -> 't28', NT0 -> 't71', etc. But wait, do any NT... produce 't84'?\n\nLooking at the terminal mappings given:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT23 there is a production to 't34', NT4 to 't56', etc. Wait, I think I might have to reconstruct the entire derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built as a sequence of replacements where each step produces more terminals, but given the length, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a combination of several 'tX' sequences that all lead through the grammar's rules. But this seems complicated.\n\nWait, another approach is to see if each token can be generated by a production that directly expands to that terminal. However, looking at the grammar, most non-terminals are two-step productions, so each node may only generate two terminals at a time. But the string given is a linear sequence, which suggests each production step adds a single terminal. Maybe the grammar can produce such a string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is the result of several productions collapsing into single terminals each time.\n\nWait, let's take the string first token 't84' and see if any production for some NT... directly gives 't84'. Looking through the terminal mappings:\n\nI'm looking for a terminal symbol 't84'. Scanning through:\n\nLooking at the terminal definitions:\n\nI don't see 't84' being directly assigned by any rule. For example, 't84' appears in NT15 -> 't71' and 't35', but 't84' isn't assigned. So how can 't84' appear in the string? This suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the mappings. Let me check again.\n\nIn the grammar, the rules are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and others, and then each non-terminal NTX has certain productions. Some of the NTX produce terminals:\n\nWait, looking through all the terminal definitions:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT15 -> 't35' or 't68' or 't43'\nNT17 -> 't68' or 't19' or 't30'\nNT20 -> 't26' or 't12' etc.\nNT22 -> 't3' etc.\nNT23 -> 't34' or 't59'\nNT24 -> several options, including 't12', 't72', etc.\nNT31 -> 't22', 't41', 't69'\nNT7 -> 't1', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t84, which I don't see being a terminal of any NTX.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake and maybe nt15 and others produce t74 or something else. Hmm, no, from the given mappings, there's no NT rule that produces 't84'.\n\nWait, maybe I should look further.

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. Looking at the grammar, it seems like the top-level non-terminals are S and NT followed by a digit, but I also notice that some have 't' followed by numbers, which are probably terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t49 t28 t78 t34 t80 t17 t65 t32 t12 t35 t80 t22 t32 t56 t59 t74 t1 t42 t68 t17`. \n\nFirst, I'll count the number of tokens to see if it's a valid structure. The grammar seems to be such that each production either has two non-terminals or something like that, because CNF requires productions to have exactly two symbols. Looking at the grammar, most production rules are of the form NTXY \u2192 something, but in the provided grammar, it's written as NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which suggests that some productions have more than two parts. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, each production must be a single non-terminal generating exactly two other symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So each production on the left should have exactly one symbol on the left and two on the right, or two on the left? No, wait, no, non-terminals can only produce two symbols, so the left side must be a single non-terminal, and the right side must consist of exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo in the given grammar, all productions like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, etc., are okay because they have a single NT on the left and two symbols on the right.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it has 20 tokens, all starting with 't'. The grammar has several productions where non-terminals are expanded to 't' plus numbers. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71' or 't35', and some others like NT23 \u2192 't69', etc.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from the top down using the grammar, starting with S and trying to generate the string step by step. Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, maybe we can match them step by step based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't49'. Let's see where 't49' comes from. In the grammar, NT19 \u2192 't1' and 't56' according to one of the entries: NT19 \u2192 't1' or 't56'. Wait, no, looking closer, the grammar has NTR19 \u2192 't1' t56, but I think the actual productions are more like NT19 \u2192 't1' | 't56', but it's written as 't1' and 't56' as separate productions. Wait, for example, NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc. So each 't... ' is a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, it's structured as each NT producing various 't' sequences. For example, NT15 is defined as: 't71', 't35'. Similarly, NT0 produces 't40', etc. So each of these seems to be a production that the NT can turn into a specific 't' token.\n\nNow, looking at the first token 't49', I need to see if any NT produces 't49'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT5 produces 't68' and 't49' as per the rules. So NT5 can produce 't49' or something else. Also, looking further, there's NT24 \u2192 't12' and 't42', etc. Wait, perhaps the initial step is to check if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to look for possible expansions that generate 't49 t28...' etc. Let me try to find which production could produce 't49'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't68' (from NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21)\n- NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT5\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any NT that can directly produce 't49'. Let's scan:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' and 't35'\n- NT3 \u2192 't11' \n- NT7 \u2192 't46' and 't1'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't32' and 't84'\n- NT24 \u2192 't79'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. For example, 't49' comes from NT19? Let me check. The grammar has:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't1' | 't56'\n\nNo, that's not 't49'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through all the NT productions to see which ones have 't49'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't68' and 't49'\n\nYes, so NT5 can directly produce 't49'. So the first token 't49' comes from NT5.\n\nSo after expanding S \u2192 NT32 NT14, let's see how that can break down.\n\nBut wait, maybe a better approach is to process the string step by step. Let me try to match the string starting with 't49'.\n\n1. The first token is 't49'. Looking for NT that can generate 't49', which seems to be NT5.\n\nSo, NT5 can be 't49'. After that, the next token is 't28'. So after 't49', we have 't28'. So the production must involve NT5 followed by another NT that produces 't28'. Looking for NT that can produce 't28': \n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't64' and 't18'\u2192 No\n- NT6 \u2192 't53' and 't27'\u2192 No\n- NT8 \u2192 't46' and 't1'\u2192 No\n- NT0 \u2192 't71' and 't20'\u2192 No\n- NT18 \u2192 't74' and 't13'\u2192 No\n- NT24 \u2192 't42' and 't72'\u2192 't42' is one option, but 't28' isn't there.\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, looking for 't28' as a production. Hmm, does any NT produce 't28'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't28'. For example, NT9 is 't49' and 't7'\u2192 No, NT17 \u2192 't68' and 't30'\u2192 No. Wait, does any NT produce 't28'? I might have missed it, so perhaps I should list all 't' productions:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the 't' tokens are produced by:\n\nNT0: 't40', 't43', 't59', '60', '71', '74', '84'\n\nWait, maybe it's better to list all possible 't's:\n\nLooking at the grammar, here are the 't' productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't43', 't59', '74', ...

Hmm, so the second token is 't28', but I don't see any NT that directly produces 't28' in the given grammar. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe 't28' is produced by a complex expansion. Let me check: looking through the grammar, perhaps NT17 can produce something else. Wait, NT17 \u2192 NT25 NT30. Let me see if that leads somewhere.\n\nBut wait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check if any NT directly produces 't28'. Looking through the grammar, perhaps none do. So 't28' is the second token.

{"custom_id":"request-368","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is: `t82 t75 t43 t56 t64 t49 t53 t84 t12 t52 t26 t70 t43 t68 t79 t12 t74 t40 t78 t49`.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to have rules structured this way, which is good because it aligns with CNF.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions are in CNF. For example, S -> NT32 NT14: here, NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals. Similarly, NT30 -> NT3 NT30 is also two non-terminals on the RHS, which should be allowed in CNF. Wait, actually, in CNF, a production can have two non-terminals, but each non-terminal must expand into terminals or non-terminals, not more than two non-terminals directly. Hmm, perhaps I need to double-check if any production has more than two non-terminals, but from a quick glance, it seems each RHS has either one terminal and one non-terminal or two non-terminals, which I think is acceptable in CNF since each RHS can have multiple non-terminals as long as they don't cause more than one expansion step beyond a single replacement.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if a production has more than two non-terminals, it's not in CNF, but I don't see any such production here. All the RHSs are either a single terminal or two non-terminals, so the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I should probably perform a parsing process or see if the string can be derived from S through the given productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals (t82, t75, etc.), I can think of it as a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nThe string has 20 tokens. Since each production in CNF either produces one terminal and one non-terminal or two non-terminals, each step in the derivation either consumes one or two symbols from the input string.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually could be tedious. Maybe I can look for the structure of the string or see if all terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that there are some terminals like 't71', 't35', etc. I should check if all the tokens in the string are present as terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\nt71, t35, t34, t21, t28, t82, t75, t43, t56, t64, t49, t53, t84, t12, t52, t26, t70, t68, t79, t40, t78, t49.\n\nWait, let me make sure I haven't missed any. Checking each production:\n\n- NT15 has rules ending with 't71', 't35', 't21', 't68'.\n- NT22 has 't3', 't14', 't40', 't26', 't19', 't7', 't1', 't34', 't23', 't33', 't11', 't17', 't43', 't68', etc.\n- NT23 has 't21', 't34', 't24', 't33', 't43', 't30', 't19', 't70', 't59', 't13', 't34', 't33', 't28', etc.\n- NT24 has 't72', 't53', 't24', etc.\nWait, perhaps I should list all unique terminals:\n\nFrom S's productions, NT32 and NT14: t75 from NT32's rule (since NT32 -> t75). NT14 has rules leading to t43. NT32 in another rule leads to t75. Similarly, NT2 has rules leading to t70, t80, t26, etc. NT12 leads to t78. NT0 leads to various t's.\n\nWait, to make this manageable, let me list all terminals as they appear in the productions:\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of all productions, the terminals are:\n\nt71, t35, t34, t21, t28, t82, t75, t43, t56, t64, t49, t53, t84, t12, t52, t26, t70, t68, t79, t40, t78, t49.\n\nNow, the string is: t82 t75 t43 t56 t64 t49 t53 t84 t12 t52 t26 t70 t43 t68 t79 t12 t74 t40 t78 t49.\n\nSo let's check each token:\n\nt82: present.\nt75: present.\nt43: present.\nt56: present.\nt64: present.\nt49: present.\nt53: present.\nt84: present.\nt12: present.\nt52: present.\nt26: present.\nt70: present.\nt43: present.\nt68: present.\nt79: present.\nt12: present.\nt74: present (Wait, in the terminals list, I don't see t74. Let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, in the production for NT7: NT7 -> t1 and t74? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see \"NT7 -> t1\" and \"NT23 -> 't74'\" as a production. So t74 is indeed a terminal. Ok.\n\nt40: present.\nt78: present.\nt49: present.\n\nSo all tokens in the string are present in the terminals of the grammar. That's a good sign, but it doesn't guarantee that the string is generated.\n\nNow, I need to see if the sequence can be derived from S using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if the structure of the string makes sense in terms of the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that the grammar seems to generate strings where various non-terminals combine to produce terminal sequences. But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Maybe I can look for specific patterns.\n\nWait, let's look for the first token: t82. In the grammar, where does t82 come from?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see \"NT0 -> t82\" as a production rule: NT0 -> 't82'. So t82 can be derived directly from NT0.\n\nSo the first symbol t82 must come from NT0. Thus, the derivation starts as:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT14 (if S has that production) or another production, but looking at the string, the next token is t75 after t82. Wait, but S's productions are:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the top-level productions are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S can branch into two different directions. But the string starts with t82, which comes from NT0.\n\nWait, but how does NT0 get derived? Let me check what rules NT0 has.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT0 has multiple productions:\n\nNH0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\n\nWait, but checking more specifically:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT0, there are:\nNT0 -> NT23 NT18\nNT0 -> NT21 NT20\nNT0 -> NT18 NT27\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me search for NT0 in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT0 appears in several places, but to check production rules, I need to list them:\n\nLooking for NT0 in the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT14 NT0 (No, looking at the grammar, S is only producing NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me list all productions involving NT0.\n\nHere's a list of NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT23 NT18\nNT0 -> NT21 NT20\nNT0 -> NT18 NT27\nNT0 -> NT20 NT27\nNT0 -> NT23 NT22"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by analyzing the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is defined with a set of productions. Each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> terminal, with no \u03b5 productions since all rules have two non-terminals except that none start with terminals initially.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it's a sequence of symbols consisting of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' seems to represent a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nScanning through the productions, I see that a few non-terminals produce terminals like t71, t34, etc. For example, S produces NT32 and NT14, which in turn produce various NTs until reaching terminals. Similarly, NT30, NT6, NT5, etc., have production rules that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nMy first thought is to construct a parse tree for the given string. If I can derive the string from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals into terminals and non-terminals, then the answer is yes.\n\nThe string is quite long, so I'll try to see if it can be broken down into segments that match the grammar rules.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either another non-terminal or a terminal on the right.\n\nI'll try to start by looking for parts of the string that could correspond to the start symbol S. Let's look at the beginning of the string: \"t71 t34 t80 t72 t53 t6\". This is six symbols long, and since each production is two symbols, the number of symbols should be 2^n, but this isn't a power of two, so maybe that's not the case here. Hmm, wait, that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the starting non-terminals. For example, S can be NT32 NT14, or NT18 NT32. So S might expand into two parts: one that produces the first pair of t's and another that produces the rest.\n\nWait, let me see. The string starts with t71, which is a terminal. Let's see what can produce t71. Looking at the grammar, NT15 -> 't71', and S also can produce NT32 and NT14, among others. So perhaps the start symbol S produces NT32 and NT14, and each of those can be further expanded.\n\nLet me see what NT32 produces. Looking through the productions, NT32 has two rules: one is NT30 NT22, and another is 't72'. Wait, no, looking again, the productions for NT32 are:\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, NT32 is a bit more complex. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT32, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT30 NT22\n\nWait, actually, looking again, in the given grammar, the production for NT32 is actually:\n\nNT32 -> NT30 NT22, but in the list, under NT32, I believe it might not have a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to check all productions for NT32.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. Oh, here's a line: NT32 -> 't75' and another line: NT2 -> 't28'. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice that NT32 has a production NT30 NT22, but then perhaps others. Wait, I think I might have misread. Let me go step by step.\n\nIn the grammar, under NT31, there are two lines:\n\nNT31 -> NT9 NT11\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\n\nAnd another line:\n\nNT14 -> NT32 NT21\n\nWait, perhaps I need to write down all the productions for each NT to keep track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to create a list of all non-terminals and their productions. That might be time-consuming, but necessary for clarity.\n\nLet me try to list all the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n   S -> NT18 NT32\n\n2.

{"custom_id":"request-383","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t78 t53 t78 t15 t71 t35 t52 t84 t6 t52 t70 t12 t46 t69 t63 t59 t32 t34 t84 t19 t26`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have a terminal. But in this case, I see that some of the rules have terminals like 't71', etc., so I guess they are terminal productions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, so each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except maybe the start symbol. But looking at the productions, everything seems to have two non-terminals except for NT15 which has three terminals, but wait, no, looking again, wait, no\u2014some of the rules for NT have terminal symbols. For example, NT5 can produce 't68' among others. So in this grammar, some rules are terminals, which is okay because CNF can include these as production rules, as terminals are not further expanded.\n\nThe string I'm given is all terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, which has two productions: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So S can produce two different sequences. Let me see the options.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\nThen NT32 \u2192 NT3 NT30\nAnd NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which is a recursive rule. Wait, that's interesting. So NT30 can expand into more NT30s and NT3s. Hmm. Let me check other productions related to NT30.\n\nLooking at NT30, the productions start with NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. So that's a recursive rule, meaning NT30 can generate a string of multiple NT3s. Let me look for where NT3 goes. From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 NT1, and NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5. Let me check NT1's productions.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5. So NT23? Let's see where NT23 goes. Looking through the rules, I see NT23 has several productions, including NT23 \u2192 't34', 't21', 't59', etc., but also NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20. Wait, that's recursive again. NT20's productions: NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7. NT12 \u2192 t78, which is a terminal. NT7 \u2192 t40 or NT23. Wait, and NT23 has another production to t1. So this could go into a loop.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for the string in the grammar by breaking it down.\n\nThe string is: t78 t53 t78 t15 t71 t35 t52 t84 t6 t52 t70 t12 t46 t69 t63 t59 t32 t34 t84 t19 t26\n\nFirst, let's see what the start symbol S can produce. S can produce either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's look for these in the string.\n\nLooking at the first token, t78. Hmm, which non-terminal could produce t78? Looking through the productions, I see that NT20 \u2192 t69 t63 t59? Wait, no, looking:\n\nWait, let me list down all the possible rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have terminal symbols listed as possible productions. For example:\n\nNT20 has a production to t26, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but actually, each production starts with the non-terminal on the left, followed by two symbols on the right. So in the productions, for each NT, the right-hand side is two symbols, but sometimes one of them is a terminal, making it a production that goes into a terminal symbol.\n\nSo for example, NT11 has production NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT22, but another production like NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT17, which might produce terminals. Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar is written as each line being a production, starting with NT and then two symbols. So for example, NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT30, etc. Then there are lines like NT15 \u2192 't71', NT15 \u2192 't35', etc. So that means NT15 can directly produce the terminals 't71', 't35', etc. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't1', and so on.\n\nSo, to get t78, which is the first token in the string, I need to find which non-terminal can produce t78. Let's look:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some NT have 't' as part of their terminals. Let me check each NT's productions for terminals.\n\n- NT2 has a production to 't49'.\n- NT4 has 't56', etc.\n- Looking through all, I see NT2: t49, NT5: t68, NT7: t40, t23, etc.\n\nWait, let me list all terminals per NT:\n\n- NT5 -> 't68', 't53', 't78', 't52', 't69', 't35', 't19', 't33', 't22', 't17', 't21', 't70', 't34', 't84', 't82', 't59', etc. Wait, no, actually, looking through the grammar provided:\n\nWait, the grammar is quite extensive. It might be easier to list all productions that directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't84'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72', 't12', 't70', 't69', 't21', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't68', 't25', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't40', 't19', 't7', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps let me check each production to see if either side is a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this step by step. Let's take the start symbol S. It has two possible productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nLet me see if the string starts with NT32 producing a t78. So looking at the first token, t78. So which NT can produce t78? Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT24 has a 't72' and 't40'. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps NT2, which has a production to t49.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to reverse engineer. Let's see if t78 can be generated by any NT.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT24 has a production to 't72' and 't40', but does it have a direct production to 't78'? Wait, checking:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions for NT24 are:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT27 NT10, NT20 NT20, NT4 NT1, NT24 NT2, NT4 NT24, NT30 NT2, NT28 NT25, NT15 NT1, etc. Hmm, no direct terminal productions except for NT30 \u2192 etc. Or wait, no\u2014do I have any NT where a production is just a single terminal? Wait, no, because in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals except for the start symbol, but looking back, no, the grammar might have terminal productions, like NT15 \u2192 't71', etc.\n\nWait, so if there are productions where the right-hand side is a terminal, that means those NTs can directly produce a terminal symbol. For example, NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', etc. So if any of these NTs have 't78' as a production, that would be helpful.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let me search for 't78' in the productions. Scanning through:\n\n- NT20 has a production to 't26' and others like 't69', 't12', etc.\n- NT7 has 't40', 't23', etc.\n- NT7 also has a production to NT23 NT5, but that might lead into terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF is a form where each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The grammar provided has all productions in this form, so that's good. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and most of the productions are of the form X -> YZ where Y and Z are non-terminals. The terminals are given directly, like 't40', 't43', etc. \n\nI need to figure out how the string is built. The string starts with 't49', which I need to see if it can be derived from any production. Let's look at the productions where a terminal appears. \n\nFrom the grammar rules, I notice that several symbols like NT7, NT13, NT17, etc., have productions that eventually lead to terminals. For example, NT1 -> NT23 NT5, NT5 has multiple productions, one of which is 't68'. Hmm, so each non-terminal eventually terminates into a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because some terminals are given directly, but I'm not sure if all non-terminals have a terminal. Wait, looking again, I see NT3 -> 't1' directly, and other non-terminals also directly go to terminals. So every production eventually leads to a terminal, either directly or via other non-terminals. So this grammar is a finite automaton, perhaps.\n\nI need to trace the string step by step. The string is a series of terminals. Each terminal must come from the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in each terminal:\n\n- 't49' comes from NT1?\n- Wait, I should look at the productions where a symbol directly goes to 't49'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT31 -> 't52', but that's not matching. Hmm, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a tree or see the sequence. The string has 21 tokens, so 21 terminals. Each production in CNF adds at most one terminal symbol, so the number of steps should correspond to the length.\n\nWait, in this grammar, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each step in the derivation either adds one terminal or two non-terminals. But the string is a concatenation of terminals; the derivation would have to have a way to produce the string through these rules. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't49'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't49'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 has two productions: one to 't71' and one to 't35', and another to 't15'. Wait, no\u2014the specific rules for NT15 are:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT15 -> 't35'\n\nSo NT15 can produce either 't35' or 't71' or 't15'? Wait no, looking back, there's a rule: \n\nNT15 -> NT15 NT5?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through each rule, let's find all NT15 productions:\n\nNT15 -> NT19 NT17\n\nWait, no\u2014let me go through each line.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT15 -> NT21 NT34\n\n- NT15 -> NT33 NT20\n\nWait no.

Maybe I should note that NT5 can produce 't68' because NT5 -> 't68'.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT5's productions:\n\nLooking through all rules, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't68' (I think I might have missed this earlier). Let me check again.\n\nThe grammar lines:\n\nLooking through each rule line:\n\nNT7 has a production to 't1' (like NT7 -> 't1'), but I don't see NT5 directly producing a terminal.

The CFG has S as the top symbol, and it starts with S -> NT32 NT32 or other options.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string to evaluate is `t84 t25 t80 t74 t28 t64 t42 t22 t46 t59 t77 t53 t68 t70 t26 t56 t3 t21 t77 t79 t35 t42`.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This means that to derive a string, every step in the derivation introduces exactly one terminal, and the non-terminals expand outward until they can't anymore.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several production rules that take a non-terminal to a terminal symbol. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- N34 \u2192 NT24 NT18\n- N15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- N23 \u2192 't34', 't59', 't69', 't21', 't23', 't34'\n- And many more where the non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nMy approach will be to find a derivation sequence that builds up the target string step by step. Since every production increases the length by one (as each production adds exactly one terminal or a non-terminal that leads to a terminal), the length of the string should be equal to the number of productions applied. Let's check the length: the given string has 21 tokens (separated by spaces), so we need a derivation with 20 steps starting from S.\n\nStarting from S, which is a non-terminal, the first step must be one of the productions of S. Looking at the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo the first two symbols should be either the result of NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Given the target string starts with 't84', I need to see if either of these non-terminals can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking at the NT32 productions, for example, NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12, which then may produce terminals. However, in the target string, the first symbol is 't84', which suggests that one of the non-terminals must produce 't84' directly.\n\nLooking through the list of NT rules, I see several where terminals are directly produced:\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1', 't15'\n- NT28 \u2192 't84' (I think) Wait, no, looking back, does any NT produce 't84'? Let me check:\nLooking at the production rules:\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69', 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1', 't15'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't59', 't69', 't21', 't23', 't34'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43', 't32', 't43', 't22', 't19', 't84', etc.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', 't21'. But looking for 't84', let me check NT0 and others.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT28 \u2192 't84'? Wait, looking at the rules... Let me scan for 't84' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice NT0 has a production: NT0 \u2192 't84'. Oh, so NT0 can produce 't84'.\n\nWait, but S cannot directly produce 't84' because S's initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So to get 't84', we need one of NT32 or NT14 to produce 't84'. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT32's productions:\n- NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12\n- NT24 has several productions; some of which produce terminals or non-terminals. Let me see if any of NT32's derivatives can lead to 't84'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe NT32 isn't the right path. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let me see if that leads somewhere. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol is 't84', which suggests that one of the NTs in the first step produces 't84'. Since S can only produce two NTs, perhaps NT32 or NT14. Let's see if NT32 can produce 't84'.\n\nLooking at NT32's rules: NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12. Then NT24 has several options, including NT24 \u2192 't72', or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Let's see what NT32 can do. NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12. Then NT24 has many options. For 't84', maybe NT24 can produce 't84' directly? Let me check: Yes, in the rules, NT24 \u2192 't72'... No, I don't see 't84' there. Wait, actually looking through the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 't84'. So maybe the only terminal 't84' comes from NT0.\n\nAh, so perhaps the string 't84' is produced by NT0, but S's initial productions don't involve NT0. Therefore, the first step must be something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the productions for T84. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69', 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1', 't15'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't59', 't69', 't21', 't23', 't34'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42', etc.\n- Oh, wait, in the rules I see:\n  - NT0 \u2192 't84'\n\nSo yes, NT0 can directly produce 't84'. But S does not have a production that starts with NT0. S's productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial S cannot produce 't84' directly. Therefore, the first symbol 't84' must come from a later production in the derivation, which would require that one of the NTs expands into 't84'. But looking at the NTs, their productions may only eventually produce 't84' via NT0. But NT0 is a terminal, so that would require that NT0 is derived from some NT. Wait, but NT0's production is NT0 \u2192 't84', so NT0 cannot be non-terminal. That's a contradiction because in a grammar, terminals can't have productions.\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't84' means that NT0 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't84'. So to produce 't84', you need NT0. But in the initial productions for S, there's no NT0. Therefore, for S to produce 't84' as the first symbol, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT32 S1, and then S1 \u2192 NT0, where S1 is another non-terminal not originally present. But wait, in the given grammar, there is no production for S that includes NT0. Therefore, it's impossible for S to derive a string starting with 't84' because S's immediate children are NT32 and NT14, which cannot produce 't84' directly.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S's productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the first two tokens must be, for example, NT32 and NT14, or NT18 and NT32.\n\nLooking at the target string: the first token is 't84', so if S produces NT32 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-422","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have a grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the string `t71 t28 t56 t56 t15 t84 t82 t19 t70 t78 t53 t56 t74 t19 t65 t22 t19 t40 t53 t26 t32 t42 t49` is generated by this grammar. The grammar consists of a set of production rules, and each rule has two non-terminals on the left side, which fits the Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Each production is either S -> NT a NT b, where a and b are terminals or non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string is a sequence of terminals, so the string is composed of terminal symbols. The idea is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that it's a complex set of productions, but I can observe that the terminals are strings like 't71', 't28', etc., which are all single tokens. Also, some non-terminals produce other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven the string to parse, it's important to note that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. The string has 23 terminals, which is a long string. My approach is to see if each production in the grammar can produce these terminals or form sequences that can be concatenated to match the string.\n\nStarting from the top symbol S, each production is a combination of non-terminals. Since all terminals must be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar, I need to check if each part of the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the string, I start from the left:\n\nt71 t28 t56 t56 t15 t84 t82 t19 t70 t78 t53 t56 t74 t19 t65 t22 t19 t40 t53 t26 t32 t42 t49.\n\nI need to find a way to factor this string into parts that match the production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, so each production can either expand into two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. The Chomsky normal form allows for productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, to parse the string, I should look for possible splits where the string can be divided into chunks that match the production rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t71, I need to find a production that ends with t71. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT15 -> 't71', which is a direct production. Similarly, NT7 -> 't1', NT13 -> 't28', etc. So, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the entire string must be generated by a sequence of productions where each non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal. However, if a production only produces terminals on the right, then the left non-terminal can be considered as a single unit producing that terminal.\n\nWait, no. Each production is S -> NT A NT B, where A and B are either terminals or non-terminals. So, to generate the string, starting from S, it's structured as S -> NT1 NT2, each NTi can produce either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut the given string is a sequence of 23 terminals, meaning that the initial production would need to chain together 23 such productions, each contributing one terminal. However, in a typical leftmost derivation, each step would produce two symbols, so the number of symbols would double each time. Starting from S, which is a single symbol, the next step would have two symbols, then four, then eight, etc. So, 23 is not a power of two, which suggests that it's impossible to have such a derivation.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. The grammar might allow for more complex derivations where some non-terminals produce terminals and others produce non-terminals. However, it's still subject to the structure of the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions where each step appends a terminal to the string. But each production in the grammar can produce at most two non-terminals at once, so producing a single terminal would require that the non-terminal on the left has a production where one of the symbols is a terminal and the other is a non-terminal that eventually produces the rest.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach. Since each production in the grammar is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, meaning each production can produce two non-terminals, which in turn can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, each step in the derivation would multiply the number of symbols by two, unless some non-terminals produce terminals. But the problem is that the given string has 23 symbols, which is an odd number after the first step. The initial S is one symbol, then each production in a leftmost derivation would double the count (assuming two non-terminals), but in this case, the given string is of size 23, which doesn't fit into a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for this to be generated by the grammar, as the derivations would result in a string whose length is a power of two or not compatible with the sequence of expansions.\n\nWait, but that might not be entirely accurate. The initial production is S, so the first step would expand into two non-terminals. Then, each of those two non-terminals can expand. For each non-terminal, if it's a terminal, it becomes one symbol, or if it's a non-terminal, it can split into two more symbols. So the total number of symbols can vary. However, the total count would still depend on the number of splits.\n\nBut 23 is an odd number, which suggests that it can't be built from the number of splits that come from the productions starting from S. For instance, the first step doubles to two, then four, then eight, etc. So the number of symbols would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. 23 is between 16 and 32 but isn't a power of two, and it's also not a sum of powers of two that could fit 23.\n\nWait, 16 + 8=24, which is one more than 23. 16 + 4 + 4=24, which is still too much. 16 + 4 + 2=22, which is less. Hmm, not sure. I'm getting myself confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string does have a specific structure that can be parsed, but looking at the grammar, I can see many terminals and non-terminals that can produce these, but the number of non-terminals and terminals might not fit. However, since each production can be a combination of any two non-terminals or terminals, I might have a way to chain them together.\n\nWait, but the total number of symbols is 23. Let's think of it as a binary tree. Each internal node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are the terminals. The depth of the tree would determine the number of symbols. For 23 symbols, the tree would have to have a structure where each split results in two symbols, leading to a binary expansion.\n\nBut 2^4=16, 2^5=32. So 23 is between 16 and 32, which is 2^4 to 2^5, which is 16 to 32. In a binary tree expansion starting from S, after n steps, the number of leaves would be 2^n. So if we go from 1 (S) to 2 (step 1), 4 (step 2), 8 (step3), 16 (step4), 32 (step5). 32 is more than 23, but it's not possible for the total symbols to be 23 because that would require a non-integer exponent of 2. So it's impossible for the number of symbols to reach 23 given the grammar's structure, as each expansion doubles the number each time.\n\nTherefore, I can definitively say that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because 23 is not a power of two, and each expansion step in the derivation must double the number of symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-421","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. The given grammar looks like it's in CNF because each production starts with a non-terminal and is followed by two other non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal and another terminal or a terminal alone. Not entirely sure, but I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t56 t40 t26 t63 t1 t74 t42 t1 t21 t15 t25 t49 t63 t34 t25 t32 t15 t69 t34 t26 t35 t52 t40`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. The approach here is probably to use a parsing method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm. But maybe a simpler approach since the string isn't too long.\n\nLet's first look at the starting symbol S. The grammar has two productions for S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo the first step is to look at the string. The first two symbols are t56 and t40. Let's check the productions for NT32 and NT18 because the first production for S is NT32 followed by something.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT32 production: It's in the rules as NT32 \u2192 NT17 (something) or NT32 \u2192 t75.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> t75\n\nAnd another production for NT32: Looking back, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT17?\n\nWait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT32: \n\n- NT32 -> NT17\n\n- Also, looking further down, there's NT32 -> t75.\n\nWait, no. Let me check properly.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT17 (something?) or NT32 is also a terminal.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has a rule:\n\nNT32 -> t75\n\nYes, under NT32: NT32 -> t75 (look for the rule NT32 -> t75).\n\nSo for S, the first option is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the string starts with t56, which could be NT32 or something else. Wait, t56 is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, is there a rule that produces t56 as a terminal? Scanning through the given rules, I see:\n\nNT19 -> t1\n\nNT7 -> t40\n\nNT30 -> t26\n\n...\n\nWait, looking for a terminal 't56', I see that there's a production NT24 \u2192 t56.\n\nYes, the rule is:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t56\n\nBut wait, how does t56 come into play here? Because in the S \u2192 NT32 NT14, NT32 can be t75, but t56 isn't part of that path. Alternatively, maybe I need to see if S can produce a string that includes t56.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's see, the first character is t56, which might be produced by some NT. Looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t56.\n\nSo if the first non-terminal in S's production is either NT32 or NT18, and then it's followed by another non-terminal. So perhaps the t56 is produced by a different production, but given that S starts with either NT32 or NT18, the first two symbols in the string must match the production starting with NT32 or NT18.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the NT32 is the next symbol, so the first symbol in the string would be NT32's production. So if the string starts with t56, that would have to be the production of NT32. Looking at the rules, NT32 can be either t75 or something else.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nNT32 has the following rules:\n\nNT32 -> NT17\n\nAlso, there's a rule: NT24 \u2192 t56, but that's different. Wait, wait, no: Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- I see NT32 -> t75\n\n- And also, in the later rules, I see NT32 production:\n\nWait, looking again, actually, I think I might have miscounted.

Hmm, context-free grammars can get a bit tricky, but let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. That should make things a bit easier in terms of parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t33 t15 t71 t28 t63 t72 t1 t84 t56 t72 t70 t22 t70 t26 t84 t40 t63 t19 t78 t3 t59 t79 t35 t32`.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I notice that some symbols like 't1', 't3', 't4' etc., are terminals, not non-terminals. So, these terminals appear in the productions. For example, looking at the productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't1' \nNT7 -> 't1' \nNT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't21' \nAnd so on.\n\nSo, any occurrence of these 't' strings must be exactly matched by the productions. That means in the string, every 't' followed by numbers must correspond to a terminal production.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it has a series of 't' terms: \n\nt33, t15, t71, t28, t63, t72, t1, t84, t56, t72, t70, t22, t70, t26, t84, t40, t63, t19, t78, t3, t59, t79, t35, t32.\n\nI need to check if each of these matches any production. Let's list out the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't21' \nNT19 -> 't1' \nNT24 -> 't72', 't59', 't20' \nNT31 -> 't21', 't24' \nNT7 -> 't1' \nND0 -> 't40', 't32', 't71', 't84', 't56', 't24', 't40' etc. Hmm, no, NT0 has multiple productions but I'm looking for terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminals and their corresponding productions.\n\nList of terminals and rules:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't21' \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT19 -> 't1' \n- NT24 -> 't72', 't59', 't20'\n- NT7 -> 't1' \n- NT3 -> 't1' \n- NT15 also has multiple terminals.\n- Looking back, NT15 has multiple options: 't71', 't35', 't21', each as separate options.\n\nAlso, NT30 -> 't26', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT21 -> 't69', and so on.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should list all the terminals and check each occurrence.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see:\n\nt33: Do any NT productions produce 't33'? Let me search through the provided grammar for any NT -> 't33'. Scanning through the rules, I don't immediately see an NT that produces 't33' as a terminal. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT31: 't35'\n- NT33: Hmm, looking for 't33' in the productions. Let me check the provided grammar again. I see NT23 -> 't24', and other rules, but not 't33' directly. So, does any NT produce 't33'? It seems not. Then, t33 might not be a terminal in this grammar. Wait, but in the string, there's a 't33'. So, if none of the NTs produce 't33', then that string can't be generated because it would require a non-terminal symbol there, but 't33' is a terminal that doesn't exist in the grammar. So that would mean the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe someone produces 't33' as a terminal. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each production for a terminal like 't33':\n\n- NT1 -> 't6' \u2192 no\n- NT24 \u2192 't12', 't42', etc., but not 't33'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't20', 't20', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't68', 't68' again, etc.\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me look through all the other non-terminals:\n\nLooking at each production, is any of them a terminal like 't33'? For example, NT25 \u2192 't64', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each production line for a terminal:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule where an NT (non-terminal) directly results in 't33'. The only terminals are defined as, for example, NT24 -> 't72' etc. So 't33' is not a terminal in the grammar; each production either results in another non-terminal or a terminal, but since none of the non-terminals produce 't33', the occurrence of 't33' in the string would be invalid.\n\nTherefore, the string has a 't33' which is a terminal that doesn\u2019t exist in the grammar's productions.

{"custom_id":"request-442","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Then the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and eventually terminals. There are a lot of productions here, but I think the key is to trace the string step by step through the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: `t40 t65 t35 t28 t40 t71 t6 t46 t42 t78 t21 t40 t77 t40 t1 t64 t65 t35 t15 t63 t77 t3 t6 t21`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of terminals: t40, t65, t35, t28, etc. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: t40, t65, t35, t28, t40, t71, t6, t46, t42, t78, t21, t40, t77, t40, t1, t64, t65, t35, t15, t63, t77, t3, t6, t21.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S can produce two main options: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the first step is either to expand S into NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32.\n\nLet me consider each possibility:\n\n1. If S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the string would start with the expansions of NT32 and NT14.\n2. If S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then the string would start with the expansions of NT18 and NT32.\n\nI need to see which of these could lead to the given string.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT32 and NT18 both expand into other non-terminals. For example, looking at NT32's productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT22 | NT4 NT6 | NT34 NT18 | NT31 NT24 | NT19 NT17 | NT3 NT30 | NT4 NT20 | NT6 NT27 | NT5 NT21 | ... etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT18 has several productions, like NT18 \u2192 NT10 NT13, NT7, etc.\n\nThe terminals in the string include t40, t65, t35, etc. I notice that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't34', NT31 \u2192 't69', and others like NT0 \u2192 't40' etc. Wait, in the given grammar, there are entries where NT symbol expands into a terminal, like NT23 \u2192 't34', or NT19 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some NT symbols directly produce terminal tokens, such as:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't71'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' and 't21'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't80'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't71', etc.\n\nSo, perhaps some of the tokens in the string can be derived directly from these NT non-terminals.\n\nLet me look at the string and see if the first token can be matched by any NT\u2192 terminal.\n\nThe first token is t40. Looking for NT rules that end with t40.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t49\n- NT24 \u2192 t17\n- NT10 \u2192 t42\n- NT34 \u2192 t74\n- NT19 \u2192 t1\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\n- NT30 \u2192 t26\n- NT0 \u2192 t40 (twice)\n- NT23 \u2192 t34 and t21\n- NT28 \u2192 t62\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT0 \u2192 t43 and others\n- NT31 \u2192 t69\n- NT24 \u2192 t79\n- NT0 \u2192 t84\n- etc.\n\nI see that NT0 expands to t40. So the first token t40 could come from NT0.\n\nSo, let's try: S \u2192 NT18 NT32 \u2192 then one part is NT18 and the other is NT32.\n\nBut the first token is t40, which is derived from NT0. So perhaps NT18 or NT32 can expand into NT0.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT18 and NT32.\n\nNT18's productions include:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT17\n- NT18 \u2192 NT10 \u2192 NT22\n- NT18 \u2192 NT13 \u2192 NT28\n- NT18 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT15\n- NT18 \u2192 NT35\n- NT18 \u2192 NT39\n- Also, looking for any NT18 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT0 or NT18 \u2192 something that leads to NT0.\n\nLooking at NT18's rules, I don't see any direct production that leads to NT0. However, NT0 is a terminal in NT23's rules when a certain path is followed.\n\nWait, but in NT18's production, one option is NT18 \u2192 NT13 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT05 etc., but maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps NT18 is not the correct path because the first token is from NT0.\n\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack. Let's consider that the first symbol is NT0 \u2192 t40. So maybe the S \u2192 NT0 something, but the grammar seems to have S \u2192 NT18 or NT32. So that approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and within those, one of the non-terminals leads to NT0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be built by a series of expansions, but it's quite long. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps each token is the result of a single production step. So, starting from S, we expand S into two non-terminals, say A and B. Then A is expanded into something that leads to the first token t40, and B to the next token t65, etc.\n\nWait, but the string is a long sequence, so perhaps it's better to represent it as a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, given that it's Chomsky Normal Form, each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps for a terminal in the string, it must be directly replaced by a non-terminal that produces a terminal.\n\nLet me check the provided grammar for which NTs produce terminals:\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't21'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't80'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't71', etc.\n- NT18 \u2192 't7' would be 't7', but in the grammar, NT18 has a production to NT35? Or perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see entries like:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't21'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't80'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't71', etc.\n\nSo, for example, NT15 can produce the terminal t71, t35, or t21. Similarly, NT7 can produce t1.\n\nIn the given string, the first token is t40. Looking at NT0, which can produce t40, as per the grammar. So if we can derive t40 as the first symbol, that works.\n\nBut how? Because S starts as NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nSo either way, S produces two non-terminals. The first token is t40, so perhaps one of those non-terminals must produce t40 via NT0.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT0 is a terminal in other productions, like NT14 \u2192 't43'? Or wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nI see lines like:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't71'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- etc.\n\nSo looking for an NT that can produce t40 as"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to check is `t12 t46 t34 t75 t72 t63 t1 t52 t65 t17 t63 t21 t19 t75 t21 t74 t56 t64 t63 t6 t68 t40 t34 t82 t71`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that any context-free grammar can be parsed, and in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either to two terminals or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S. The given string is made up of terminal symbols, all lowercase t followed by numbers. \n\nWait, the grammar has NT and S symbols. So the initial step is to see how the string is constructed, breaking it down into possible non-terminals and terminals according to the productions.\n\nThe string is quite long, but let's see if I can break it down. I'll list out the tokens to make it easier:\n\nt12, t46, t34, t75, t72, t63, t1, t52, t65, t17, t63, t21, t19, t75, t21, t74, t56, t64, t63, t6, t68, t40, t34, t82, t71.\n\nNow, I need to see if these can be derived from the starting symbol S. Let me think about the top-level productions in the grammar. The grammar (transcript provided earlier) starts with S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. So, the initial steps would be S => NT... NT....\n\nSo the string must eventually break down into S, which produces NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's see what NT32 and NT14 are. Looking at the productions, NT32 has several options. Let's see: for example, NT32 could be NT2 NT22, which might break into more non-terminals. Alternatively, NT32 is a terminal, or can be other combinations.\n\nWait, but in the provided productions, NT32 is a terminal? Or no. Looking back at the productions, the ones that start with NT32 are:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\nWait, no, wait, looking at the list:\n\nNT32 productions:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\nNo other NT32 productions listed. So that must mean that NT32 is a non-terminal that can only be replaced by NT2 NT22. Then, NT2 and NT22 are also non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, we see 't34', which is a terminal. Now, I need to check if any of the non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, each non-terminal can be replaced by either terminals or other non-terminals. So perhaps the string can be generated by a sequence of productions leading down to the terminals seen.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it's going to take a while to parse, but let's try to see if it's possible.\n\nFirst, since S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's look at both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: S -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo then, the string would break into two parts: one derived from NT18 and another from NT32.\n\nSimilarly, Case 2: S -> NT32 NT14\n\nIn both cases, each part of the string (from NT18 and NT32, or NT32 and NT14) needs to generate the respective parts of the given string.\n\nBut let's look at the first few symbols: t12, t46, t34, t75, t72, t63, etc. So maybe the initial part is NT32 generating t34, t75, t72, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first few tokens are t12, t46, t34, t75, t72, t63. So maybe NT32 could generate a t34, but looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for any NT32 that starts with a terminal. From the provided productions, I don't see any NT32 that directly produces a terminal. So perhaps t34 comes from a deeper production, maybe NT24 -> 't72', but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is such that certain non-terminals directly match the terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, there are productions where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, several of them have 't' followed by numbers, such as:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT24 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT17 -> 't68'\nNT30 -> 't26'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, some non-terminals (NT15, NT19, NT24, NT5, NT17, NT30) directly produce terminals. So the string must be a sequence of these terminals arising from terminal productions of non-terminals.\n\nSo our first task is to see if the entire string can be built starting from S by expanding into the terminals.\n\nSo starting with S, which can be NT18 NT32 or NT32 NT14.\n\nAssuming case 1: S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nThen, NT18 and NT32 each produce certain strings.\n\nWait, but NT18 is a non-terminal, so it must further produce a string of terminals and non-terminals. Similarly, NT32.\n\nLet me see, what does NT18 replace into? Looking through the productions, I don't see NT18 producing anything. So perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal that leads to a terminal. Wait, checking the productions, maybe I missed NT18.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has the following:\n\nLooking through the NT18 productions:\n\nWait, looking for NT18 in the list.\n\nLooking, for example: NT19 -> 't1', but the list doesn't have NT18.\n\nSo perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal that only appears in the S productions. Since S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, but in general, NT18 might only appear in S.\n\nWait, but wait, S might produce itself. No, S is the start symbol and may not have cycles. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the productions are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo in both cases, S is expanding into two non-terminals.\n\nNow, considering that the given string starts with t12, which is a terminal that comes from NT something. So perhaps the derivation flows by first expanding S to NT32 NT14 (case 1) and then each NT32 and NT14 to other non-terminals or terminals, eventually leading to t12.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT32 and NT14.\n\nLooking at NT32, the only production is NT32 -> NT2 NT22. Similarly, NT14: NT14 -> NT31 NT21.\n\nSo, S -> NT32 NT14 implies that each of these non-terminals then gets expanded.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nSo, the first part is NT32, which becomes NT2 NT22. The second part is NT14, which becomes NT31 NT21.\n\nThen, each of those non-terminals (NT2, NT22, NT31, NT21) would be expanded further.\n\nWait, but maybe for our purposes, we can represent this as S \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 ( ... ) ( ... ).\n\nBut since we have a long string, perhaps the best way is to construct the leftmost derivation, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps an easier way is to see if each of the tokens in the string can be covered by the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't12'.

{"custom_id":"request-461","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I remember that context-free grammars are defined in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal symbol. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems that all the rules are indeed in Chomsky normal form because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal and vice versa. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, that's two non-terminals, and NT5 -> 't68' which is a terminal. So, the grammar is properly formatted.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t26 t25 t12 t33 t70 t12 t63 t74 t1 t70 t49 t43 t80 t35 t82 t15 t84 t6 t74 t62 t79 t43 t25 t74 t62`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string contains multiple 't' terms, which I assume are terminals. The grammar has several production rules where non-terminals expand into one or more terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30 and NT1 -> NT23 NT5. These rules can produce a string of terminals, potentially a single 't' term if the process can terminate.\n\nSince the problem is to check whether the string is generated by the grammar, I think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each 't' can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI should also note that the grammar has some non-terminals that directly map to terminals, like NT5 -> 't68', NT15 -> 't71', etc. So as I go through the string, when I see a 'tXXXX' term, I need to check if it's produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me list out all the 't' terms in the string to see which non-terminals might produce them:\n\n- t26: Looking at the grammar, NT20 \u2192 t26. So, t26 is derived from NT20.\n- t25: Hmm, NT10 \u2192 t22, but t25 is another terminal. Wait, actually, looking at NT25: it has a production rule NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10. But none of the immediate rules for NT25 expand into 't25', so maybe I need to trace back. Alternatively, perhaps another non-terminal produces t25.\n\nWait, looking at NT28: there's a production NT28 -> NT21 NT25, and also NT28 -> NT25 NT10. But I don't see any NT producing 't25' directly. Let me check the list again. Oh, wait, no. Looking for 't25', I see in the grammar NT15 can produce 't71', but that's a different number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because the numbers are all over the place. Let me make a note of each 't' in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nt26: NT20 is the one for t26.\nt25: Hmm, none of the non-terminals directly produce t25. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't25' as a terminal. The non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc., have productions that either expand further or produce terminals with other non-terminals. So, perhaps 't25' is not directly produced by any non-terminal, which would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar. But that can't be right because the string includes 't25', so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's produced through a chain. For example, if NT25 can produce 't25' indirectly. Let me check: NT25 has rules NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10 and NT27 \u2192 NT9 NT21, NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7, NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23, etc. I'm not sure if any of these produce 't25' directly. Wait, actually, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake earlier because I notice that NT15 can produce 't71' and 't35', and NT23 can produce 't34' and 't19' directly. But 't25' is nowhere directly mapped.\n\nWait, maybe 't25' is actually from a non-terminal that I'm not seeing. Let me check the grammar again. scrolling through, I see NT28 has two rules: NT28 -> NT21 NT25 and NT28 -> NT25 NT10. So, if NT25 can produce 't25', but I don't see such a rule. Oh, wait, looking deeper, I see NT28 -> NT25 NT10 and NT10 -> t22. So, perhaps it's not possible for NT25 to directly produce 't25'.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try a different approach, like building the parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t26 t25 t12 t33 t70 t12 t63 t74 t1 t70 t49 t43 t80 t35 t82 t15 t84 t6 t74 t62 t79 t43 t25 t74 t62\n\nLet me try to map each 't' to the non-terminal that can produce it. Starting from the beginning.\n\nFirst 't26' comes from NT20. So, one part is NT20.\n\nNext is 't25', which I'm not sure about. Maybe looking back, perhaps NT25 can produce 't25' through a chain. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should pick a different approach, like checking if all the terminals in the string are covered by the terminals present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals I see are: t1, t2, t4, t6, t7, t9, t10, t12, t13, t14, t15, t17, t18, t19, t20, t21, t22, t23, t24, t25, t26, t27, t28, t30, t31, t32, t33, t34, t35, t40, t43, t49, t5, t68, etc. Wait, but when I look at the string, all the 't's are from t1 to t84, but the grammar doesn't produce all these terminals directly. For example, 't84' is present in the string but I don't see any non-terminal in the grammar that directly matches 't84'. That might already indicate that the string can't be generated.\n\nLet me check: in the grammar, does any rule produce 't84' directly? Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT with a production going directly to 't84'. So, that's a problem because the string includes 't84', which may not be produced by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but I might be wrong because when I look again, some non-terminals have multiple rules, perhaps one of them expands into 't84'. Let me check NT84, but actually, the grammar doesn't have NT84. The string has 't84', and none of the NT production rules in the grammar produce 't84'.\n\nSo, since the grammar doesn't have the terminal 't84', the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-486","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it does seem to fit that structure. Most of the productions are of the form NT_number \u2192 NT_a NT_b, and some have terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. So that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t21 t62 t12 t19 t49 t43 t74 t28 t84 t17 t15 t65 t63 t70 t33 t63 t62 t79 t69 t70 t12 t69 t35 t74 t15 t74`. Wow, that's a long string with a bunch of these 't' tokens. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process will involve applying productions step by step, expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain. Since it's CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal, which can be thought of as a single-step expansion.\n\nBut the string has 27 tokens, which is quite a lot. I need to find a way to parse this. One approach could be to use recursive descent parsing or some kind of top-down method. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I might be able to find a way to recursively decompose the string step by step.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol S and see its productions. The start symbol S can go to NT32 NT32 or NT14 NT16 (though looking at the grammar, it's actually S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32; I might have misread earlier, let me confirm: yes, the initial productions are S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32. So each S production requires two non-terminals followed by another non-terminal. Therefore, each production starts with two non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first production is S -> NT32 NT32, so to produce the string starting with 't21', I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't21'.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals in the grammar, some have productions that include 't' terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. So 't's are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSo maybe I should start by looking for the 't's in the string and trace back through the grammar.\n\nThe first token is t21. Let me find where 't21' is defined. Looking through the productions, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', NT7 \u2192 't1', NT28 \u2192 't82', etc. Wait, I'm looking for 't21'. Hmm, looking at the productions, I think NT23 has a production to 't34', but not 't21'. Wait, let me check again. Oh, I see: NT19 \u2192 't1', NT15 \u2192 't35', NT15 \u2192 't15', etc. Hmm, maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that have productions that include the terminals from the string. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the productions, the non-terminals and their terminal productions are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT15 \u2192 't43', 't15', 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't21'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't26', 't25', 't74', 't46', 't7', 't82', etc. Wait, no, 't21' comes from NT23 \u2192 't21' in one of the productions? Let me check: yes, looking at the list, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', 't19', 't70', 't21', etc. So NT23 can produce t21, t34, t19, t70.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34 (production line: NT23 -> 't34')\n- NT23 \u2192 t21 (another production line: NT23 -> 't21')\n- Also, NT23 \u2192 t70 (line: NT23 -> 't70')\n- etc.\n\nSo NT23 can produce 't21', which is our first token. So that's a possible start.\n\nLet me tentatively assign that S \u2192 NT18 NT32 (since the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT32, but I see another production S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the initial productions were:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, is that correct? Or did I misread? Let me double-check. The user provided the grammar as:\n\n```plaintext\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n...\n```\n\nSo S can produce NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32. Thus, the first part of the string must come from NT32 or NT18, followed by NT32.\n\nBut our string starts with t21, which is a terminal. So the first non-terminal must be NT23, which can produce t21.\n\nSo the first step would be breaking down the first 't21' into NT23, but then we need to see if that's compatible with the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I should instead try to parse the string step by step using the CFG. Since it's in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser.\n\nLet me outline the possible productions for each non-terminal that result in terminals.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S can be either NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if either NT32 or NT18 can produce the first part of the string.\n\nWait, the string is t21 t62 t12 t19 t49..., but the terminals are not consecutive. So perhaps I should parse each terminal step by step.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I can try to break the string down into possible segments based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: `t21 t62 t12 t19 t49 t43 t74 t28 t84 t17 t15 t65 t63 t70 t33 t63 t62 t79 t69 t70 t12 t69 t35 t74 t15 t74`\n\nI notice that the first token is t21. From the grammar, NT23 can produce t21, so perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, S \u2192 NT32 NT32 could start with t21, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a parse tree approach. Each production that ends in a terminal can be a leaf. So, starting from the beginning:\n\nThe first token is t21, which is a terminal. So that must come from a production where the non-terminal on the left can produce t21. As we saw, NT23 can produce t21.\n\nSo, if we have S \u2192 NT18 NT32 or S \u2192 NT32 NT32.\n\nIf the first non-terminal is NT23, which produces t21, then the next part must come from the remaining part of the production. Since S \u2192 NT32 NT32, the next would have to be NT32 followed by NT32. But wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT32, which could be NT32 producing t62 and then NT32 producing the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into a sequence of productions starting from S.\n\nEach step involves replacing a non-terminal with its production until all are terminals.\n\nBut doing this for a 27-token string is tedious.

{"custom_id":"request-489","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Let me first understand the structure of the grammar and then look at the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions are a bunch of S and NT rules. Each NT seems to break down into two other NTs. The string given is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the terminal symbols in the string. It looks like they are: t77, t46, t59, t28, t26, t21, t64, t84, t40, t69, t25, t53, t6, t3, t77, t56, t74, t22, t40, t34, t12, t72, t79, t78, t80, t32.\n\nWait, I notice that t40 appears three times and t72 appears twice. I should check the grammar to see if these terminals are present. Looking through the production rules, I see NT0 -> 't40', so 't40' is allowed. Similar for others: t77, t46, etc., all seem to be terminals as they are under NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of these terminals. I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar. Each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until I reach terminals.\n\nLooking at the starting symbol S, its productions are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo the first step must be either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let me see what NT32 and NT18 produce.\n\nFrom the rules, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\nNT18 -> NT23 NT20\n\nWait, but let me backtrack. Let's pick the first production: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nSo NT32: looking at the grammar, NT32 is not a terminal, so it must be broken down. NT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nNow, looking at NT2 and NT22:\n\nNT2 -> NT22 NT15\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Let me look again. The production for NT2 is:\n\nNT2 -> NT22 NT15\n\nWait, but then each of those non-terminals needs to be broken down.\n\nWait, let me try to parse the string using a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the string as a series of terminal steps and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to represent the string as a parse tree. Let me attempt that.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which can produce NT32 and NT14. Let's assume the string starts with NT32 -> NT2 NT22. Then NT2 -> NT22 NT15, and NT22 -> NT8 NT0, etc.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into the rules.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string in order to see if they can be the results of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at t77: from the rules, NT31 -> 't77' (I think). Let me check. Yes, NT31 -> 't77' when it's under some conditions. So if somewhere in the derivation, NT31 is used, it can produce 't77'.\n\nSimilarly, t46: from NT8 -> 't46', so if NT8 is generated, it can produce 't46'.\n\nt59: from NT24 -> 't59' because in the rules, NT24 -> 't42' and some other rules, but wait, looking back, in NT24 -> 't59' is not directly stated. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT24 -> 't42' under NT24 -> NT24 NT15. Wait, let me go back. The rules list includes a line NT24 -> 't42'. So if NT24 is generated, it can produce 't42'. So 't59' must come from some other NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Looking at the production rules:\n\nI see NT29 -> 't59' because looking through the productions, near the end, I see NT29 -> 't59'. Yes, so NT29 can produce 't59'.\n\nSo, going through each terminal in the string, let's see:\n\n- t77: comes from NT31\n- t46: comes from NT8\n- t59: comes from NT29\n- t28: let me check NT6 -> 't28'? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT6 -> 't28' yes: NT6 -> 't28' directly.\n\nThen t26: looking at the rules, NT20 -> 't26' because there's a production NT20 -> 't26'.\n\nt21: is there a terminal 't21'? Looking, yes, NT21 -> 't21' because one of the rules says NT21 -> 't6' and others. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see NT0 -> 't21'? Wait, no, wait: let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see several NTs that produce t's:\n\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT25 -> 't64'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT27 -> 't77'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT29 -> 't59'\n- NT31 -> 't77'\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT19 -> 't1'\n- etc.\n\nSo, for 't21', perhaps NT21 is a terminal, but looking at the string, 't21' doesn't appear as a terminal in the rules. Wait, the string has t21 as the 6th element. Let me check if there's a rule for NT21 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT21 -> 't69' because NT21 -> NT69, and perhaps other rules. Wait, no, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking specifically, the rule NT21 -> 't69' is present? Let me check. The production NT21 -> 't69' is listed: one line is NT31 -> 't69', another is NT21 -> 't69'? Wait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT31 -> 't69' and NT21 -> 't69' seems to be another rule? Or maybe I misread. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLine: NT31 -> 't69' is not exactly as such. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Maybe I should make a list of all the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the rules given, the terminal productions (those that produce t's) are:\n\n- NT15 -> 't15'\n- NT15 -> 't35'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT15 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT29 -> 't59'\n- NT31 -> 't77'\n- NT0 -> 't84'\n- NT23 -> 't21'\n- NT24 -> 't12'\n- NT7 -> 't80'\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT7 -> 't46' (Wait, no, looking through, I don't see any t46 terminal. Wait, earlier I thought t46 comes from NT8. Let me check.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-510","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is `t34 t56 t72 t71 t68 t35 t79 t26 t53 t71 t84 t84 t46 t25 t82 t65 t26 t62 t52 t49 t6 t22 t84 t32 t68 t84 t72`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG. It's given in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the productions, they start with S and consist of multiple non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, and from there, the grammar builds strings by expanding non-terminals into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse the string using this grammar. Parsing with such a complex CFG sounds daunting, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to approach this systematically.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are mostly combinations like t34, t56, etc. These look like terminal symbols, which are not further expanded by the grammar. Some are part of the production rules, like t71, t72, etc.\n\nSince each production in CNF is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, the generated string should be a sequence of terminals, with the non-terminals expanded as needed. Each non-terminal in the string must be part of some production that leads to the terminals.\n\nOne approach is to reconstruct the derivation starting from S and see if it can yield the given string. Alternatively, I can parse the string step by step to see if it can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nLet me write out the string again: t34 t56 t72 t71 t68 t35 t79 t26 t53 t71 t84 t84 t46 t25 t82 t65 t26 t62 t52 t49 t6 t22 t84 t32 t68 t84 t72.\n\nI can start by looking at the entire string and trying to break it down into parts that match the productions.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t34, which I need to see if there is a production that starts with t34 as a terminal. Looking through the production rules, I see that some terminals are present, like t34, t56, t72, etc.\n\nLooking at the production for S: S -> NT32 NT14. But NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals. So the string should start with a production that leads to t32 and t14, but these might not be terminals. Wait, no, because in the string, the first element is t34, which is a terminal. So perhaps S isn't the starting point here; maybe another production.\n\nWait, no, the string starts with t34, so maybe the entire string is derived from a series of non-terminals and terminals. Let me think differently.\n\nEach production is of the form NT... -> something, where each something is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps I can split it into segments that match the productions. Let me check if some part of the string corresponds to a production.\n\nFor example, the first part is t34 t56. Let's see if there's a production that says something like t34 t56. Looking through the production rules, I don't see a production that starts with t34 followed by t56. The productions involve non-terminals, so the string elements that are terminals must come directly from a terminal production.\n\nPerhaps each terminal in the string must be either a terminal symbol in the grammar or generated by a terminal expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some of the non-terminals have productions that include terminals. For example, NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', 't19', etc. So some of the terminals in the string could be generated from these non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's see the production NT15's rules: NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't19', or possibly others. So if any part of the string is 't71', it can be traced back through NT15.\n\nBut in the string, I see 't71' twice: at positions 5 and 10. Wait, no: looking at the string again:\n\nt34 t56 t72 t71 t68 t35 t79 t26 t53 t71 t84 t84 t46 t25 t82 t65 t26 t62 t52 t49 t6 t22 t84 t32 t68 t84 t72.\n\nSo the string is:\n\n1. t34\n2. t56\n3. t72\n4. t71\n5. t68\n6. t35\n7. t79\n8. t26\n9. t53\n10. t71\n11. t84\n12. t84\n13. t46\n14. t25\n15. t82\n16. t65\n17. t26\n18. t62\n19. t52\n20. t49\n21. t6\n22. t22\n23. t84\n24. t32\n25. t68\n26. t84\n27. t72\n\nI can start by checking if t34 is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT8 has production NT8 -> t11 NT10. But that's a mix of non-terminal and terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nMaybe I should identify the terminals and see if each of them appears in the grammar as a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many of the NT... are non-terminals, and some of them produce terminal strings like 't34', 't56', etc. So each terminal in the string must be matched by a production that has that terminal as a result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built from the non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals and terminals. But I'm a bit stuck, so maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nI can try to decompose the string into segments that match the production rules.\n\nLooking for longer sequences that match a single production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the beginning: t34 t56. Is there a production that starts with t34 followed by t56? I don't see such a production. So perhaps this is part of a longer expansion. Maybe t34 comes from a production like S, as S can derive certain combinations.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which is NT32 and NT14. But NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals, so their expansions would produce more symbols.\n\nBut then, for the string to start with t34, perhaps there's a chain that eventually leads to t34 as the first symbol. Let me look for a production that has t34 as the next symbol after some steps.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I notice that NT8 has production NT8 -> t11 NT10. So if there's a t8 somewhere, it could come from NT8.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t34. Maybe t34 comes from some production. Let's check where t34 is produced: looking at the production list, I see that NT31 -> 't24' and other combinations, but I also see NT28 -> t82, which doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the production rules again. I see:\n\nNT15 can produce t71, t35, etc. NT19 can produce t19, etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT5 -> t68: yes, NT5 is one that produces a terminal.\n- NT19 can produce t1 and t23.\n- NT23 can produce t21 and t28.\n- NT24 can produce t7, t32, etc.\n- NT25 can produce t27 and t10.\n- NT27 can produce t77 and t10.\n- NT31 can produce t22 and t14, etc.\n- NT34 can produce t24 and t18.\n- NT32 is a terminal, as it appears as 't32' in one production.\n- Similarly, NT14 is a terminal (t14).\n\nWait a second, this indicates that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5 -> 't68', which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-501","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t52 t6 t46 t62 t68 t64 t63 t40 t63 t62 t35 t3 t71 t40 t26 t40 t78 t26 t21 t62 t65 t3 t12 t21 t71 t52 t70`. That's quite a long string with several tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that most of the productions are either two non-terminals or ending with a single terminal like 't71', 't32', etc. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the task is to check whether the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which expands two non-terminals. So S can derive into two parts that each further expand.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the terminal symbols in the productions. Since the string is a series of terminals, each production that leads to a terminal is a leaf in the parse tree. The non-terminals will correspond to branches in the tree.\n\nLet me look at the structure of the grammar. It seems that many non-terminals are recursive, like NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which allows for multiple derivations until it eventually hits a terminal. The same goes for other non-terminals such as NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nBut the string starts with 't52'. I'll check if there's a production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't52'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', etc. But 't52' isn't among the terminals for any of the non-terminals I'm aware of. Wait, looking further, I see NT29 \u2192 't28', and NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', 't29', and some others, but no 't52'.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe I missed something. Oh, in the productions under NT25, I see NT25 \u2192 't64', which is a terminal, so from NT25, we can get 't64'.\n\nWait, maybe the first step is to check which non-terminal can produce 't52'. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't3' (from NT22 \u2192 NT13 NT22 and so on)\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42' (twice)\n- NT27 \u2192 't77'\n- NT30 \u2192 't26' via NT27, etc.\n- NT32 \u2192 't2' (wait, no, looking back, for S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so 't32' comes from NT32? Or maybe from another step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing symbols. The grammar's terminals seem to be the 't' followed by numbers. So let's list out some terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, the terminals appear as 't71', 't82', 't53', 't6', etc. Wait, actually, no\u2014Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nAh, in the grammar, some productions have terminals like 't71', 't46', etc. Wait, no, looking again, the productions like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which are not terminals unless those non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the only terminals are those that are directly written as 't' followed by numbers. Let me check:\n\nIn the productions, for example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- NT32 is a non-terminal, so S's production can't produce a terminal immediately.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to parse the string and see which parts could correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's consider each symbol in the string: t52, t6, t46, t62, t68, t64, etc.\n\nI need to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production in the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, maybe a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be matched in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step can only expand a non-terminal into two other non-terminals. So, in the parse tree, each node (non-terminal) has exactly two children or a terminal.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, it's like a binary tree where leaves are terminals, and each internal node is a non-terminal.\n\nGiven that the string is the result of leftmost derivation, I can try to see if the string can be formed by expanding S into terminals.\n\nBut this seems complicated, so maybe a better approach is to look for any occurrence of 't52' in the grammar. Because the string starts with 't52', there must be a production that directly gives 't52'. But looking through the given grammar, I don't see any production that directly gives 't52' as a terminal. All terminals are names like 't71', 't82', etc.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals have terminals as their productions. For example:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28' and others like 't68'\n- NT22 \u2192 't3'\n- Not seeing any 't52' as a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't52', so unless there's a non-terminal that can produce 't52', it's impossible to derive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 't52' in the productions. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', 't29', etc.\n- NT29 \u2192 't28', 't62', etc.\n\nWait, in NT0's productions, there's NT0 \u2192 't43', 't84', 't21', 't20', etc. But none of these are 't52'.\n\nWait, I'm going to go through each production to see if any terminal is 't52', but so far, I don't see any.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't43', 't84', 't21', 't20', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't28', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the productions listed more carefully. Let me go through each line:\n\nWait, here are some lines in the grammar:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't42' twice\n- NT30 \u2192 't26' via NT27, etc.\n- NT32 \u2192 't32'? No, that's a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\nNT0 \u2192 NT21 NT20\nNT0 \u2192 NT18 NT27\nAnd that's all, so no 't' symbols here. Hmm.\n\nWait, so perhaps the string cannot be generated because there's no non-terminal that can produce 't52' as a terminal. So if the string starts with 't52', but no production directly or indirectly leads to it, then the string is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production. Let me check the entire list again to be thorough.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't15' and others, no 't52'.\n- NT2 \u2192 't28', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't68', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't40', etc.\n- NT13 \u2192 't28', 't68', etc.\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't59', etc., no 't52'.\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't25', etc.\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc., no 't52'.\n- NT29 \u2192 't62', 't28', etc.\n- NT17 \u2192 't68' (in two places) and others, but no 't52"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-523","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t40 t72 t46 t71 t82 t6 t71 t68 t6 t70 t63 t71 t74 t80 t17 t32 t6 t74 t19 t6 t78 t26 t59 t32 t84 t46 t40 t59`. \n\nFirst off, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production is either:\n1. A single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side (LHS) and two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS).\n2. A non-terminal symbol on the LHS and a terminal symbol on the RHS.\n\nBut looking at the provided grammar, I notice that some productions have terminals on the RHS. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT32\n(Wait, no, actually, the initial productions from S are both S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the RHSs are non-terminals until they produce terminals. Hmm.)\n\nActually, I'm a bit confused because the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals on the RHS of the productions. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all the RHS seem to be non-terminals except for some points where terminals like 't40', 't72', etc., appear towards the end. That might indicate that the grammar has been rewritten to produce terminals in the RHS.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the RHS can only be two non-terminals because each production is of the form A \u2192 BC. But if the RHS is a terminal, that's not allowed in CNF. So perhaps the grammar provided isn't exactly in CNF because some productions have terminals on the RHS. That makes me think that maybe the grammar has been simplified and some non-terminals have been transformed to include terminals, but that complicates the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar was converted into CNF, and in doing so, some rules have terminals now. Wait, no, in CNF, the RHS of each production must consist of exactly two non-terminals. So if any production has a terminal on the RHS, that would violate CNF. Therefore, either the grammar isn't in CNF, or there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting it.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that some non-terminals in the RHS are actually terminal symbols. For example, in one production, it says `NT6 -> NT18 NT27`, which is two terminals, or wait, NT18 and NT27 are non-terminals, right? But in other places, like `NT5 -> 't68'`\u2014wait, that can't be right. Because in CNF, the RHS must be non-terminals, so having 't68' would be a terminal, which would mean that production is A \u2192 tB, which isn't allowed in CNF. Therefore, perhaps the given grammar is not in CNF, or perhaps it's been transformed into another form.\n\nWait, the user said the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, so maybe the question is a bit different. Maybe the grammar uses a different structure, like combining rules with a single non-terminal and a terminal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar was transformed to include unit productions or null productions, but that might not fit CNF. So perhaps I should focus on the structure of the grammar and the string to determine whether the string can be generated by the given rules.\n\nBut given the time, maybe I can use another approach. Since the problem involves a lot of non-terminals and terminals, perhaps the best way is to model the string as a series of transitions according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of non-terminals that can lead to the terminals in the order given.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t72 t46 t71 t82 t6 t71 t68 t6 t70 t63 t71 t74 t80 t17 t32 t6 t74 t19 t6 t78 t26 t59 t32 t84 t46 t40 t59`.\n\nThat's a lot of 't' terms, each with a number. Each seems to represent a terminal symbol, so perhaps each 'tXX' is a terminal. \n\nI think the approach would be to see if starting from the start symbol (S), we can derive a string that starts with t40 and so forth, following the grammar rules step by step.\n\nBut given the size of the string, this might be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to decompose the string into parts that can be generated by the rules.\n\nLet me look for which 't' terms are generated by which non-terminals.\n\nFor example, looking for 't40' in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT0 -> 't40' is a production. So NT0 can generate 't40'. Similarly, other 't's are generated by specific non-terminals. For instance, NT23 -> 't34', NT15 -> 't71', etc.\n\nSo perhaps we can construct a derivation starting from S, breaking down the string step by step, replacing non-terminals with their possible productions until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nBut given the string length, this is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced by looking at parts of the string and seeing if each terminal can be matched by a production, possibly in reverse.\n\nWait, maybe we can use a top-down approach. Let's start with the first part and see if it can be generated.\n\nThe string starts with t40. Looking at the grammar, NT0 can directly produce t40 (NT0 -> 't40'). So the first part of the string could be derived from NT0. Then, after t40, the next symbol is t72.\n\nSo, after generating t40, we need to look at what comes next. So, perhaps t40 is generated by NT0, and the rest of the string (starting from the next symbol) should be derived from the same NT0, or perhaps from another non-terminal that's been expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is generated by the start symbol S. So the first step is to see what S can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S can produce either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nNow, considering the first symbol of the string is 't40', which comes from NT0. So how can S lead to something that can produce t40?\n\nLooking at S's productions:\n\nNT32 is a non-terminal. So what can NT32 produce? Looking through the grammar, NT32's productions include NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT27, and perhaps other rules. Wait, according to the given grammar, NT32 appears in multiple productions:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT27\n- And others, but I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, the user provided a lot of grammar rules but in a possibly out-of-order format. For example, looking through, NT32 has multiple rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT27 NT10\nNT32 -> NT17 NT10\nNT27 -> NT77 NT10\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Maybe a better approach is to look for NT32's possible productions.\n\nWait, perhaps some of these productions are:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT27 NT10\n- NT32 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n- Others?\n\nWait, maybe I can find how NT32 can reach other non-terminals. For example, the first symbol is 't40', which comes from NT0. So perhaps in the derivation, one of the NTs in the S's RHS must produce 't40'. So in S's RHS, one of the non-terminals must expand to include 't40'.\n\nLooking at S's RHS possibilities:\n\nOption 1: NT32 NT14.\n\nSo one non-terminal is NT32 and the other is NT14.\n\nOption 2: NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, in both cases, perhaps one of these non-terminals can produce 't40'. Let's see which ones can produce 't40'.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules where a non-terminal produces 't40', I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- Perhaps others? Looking through, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', NT15 \u2192 't71', etc. So only NT0 can directly produce 't40'.\n\nWait, no, in fact, in the given grammar, NT0 has multiple productions, including NT0 \u2192 't40'.

{"custom_id":"request-527","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty complex, with a lot of non-terminals and productions. The string to check is `t33 t32 t75 t75 t64 t26 t62 t21 t71 t42 t75 t43 t72 t62 t6 t22 t65 t68 t72 t77 t80 t80 t17 t74 t70 t80 t32 t75`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production is either to a terminal or two non-terminals. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a single terminal. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. So, the given grammar is correctly in CNF, right?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see some productions where a non-terminal is on the left, and the right side is either two non-terminals or sometimes a mixture of non-terminals and terminals. For example, S -> NT32 NT14 \u2014 that's two non-terminals. But elsewhere, like NT5 -> NT27 NT21, that's also two non-terminals. Wait, but sometimes there are more. Let me check a few more. Like NT15 has productions like NT15 -> 't71', NT15 -> 't35', and NT15 -> 't68', as well as NT15 -> 't19'. Wait, no, looking more carefully, NT15 has multiple productions: t15 can produce 't71', 't35', 't68', 't19'. But in the grammar, NT15's productions are:\n\nNT15 -> NT29 NT20\nNT15 -> NT25 NT20\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT15 -> 't35'\nNT15 -> 't68'\nNT15 -> 't19'\n\nSo each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So yes, the grammar is in CNF, because every right-hand side is either one terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is a sequence of terminal symbols, each presumably corresponding to a production step. The string given is 30 tokens long, which seems quite long, so it might represent a moderately complex derivation.\n\nIn CNF, the shortest derivation for a string of k terminals must consist of k-1 non-terminals. So, for a string of length 30, we'd need 29 non-terminals. But I don't know the exact structure of the grammar, so it's hard to say without building the derivation tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be reached through the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are all strings of 't' followed by numbers. So, let's see: t33, t32, t75, etc. Now, the grammar has multiple 't' terminals, which are presumably the terminals of the language.\n\nBut instead of building the entire derivation, maybe I can try to reconstruct the parse tree from the string, checking if each 't' can be generated by some terminal production. Alternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be reduced back to the start symbol S.\n\nEach 't' must be a terminal that's defined in the grammar. So, looking at the grammar, for example, NT15 can produce t1, t7, etc. So I need to check each terminal in the string to see if it has a production.\n\nBut wait, some of the 't's in the string might not have any productions. For example, if 't42' appears, I need to check if NT10 can produce t42 according to the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT10 -> NT22 NT5\nNT15 -> t42? Wait, no, I see something different. Let me look again at the grammar productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT10 has a production: NT10 -> NT22 NT5, which is two non-terminals, so that's allowed in CNF. But the 't's in the string must come from productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, for example:\n\nNT5 -> t68\n\nSo, when NT5 is on the left, it can produce a terminal t68. Similarly, NT19 can produce t1, etc.\n\nSo, in the string, every 't' must be the result of a production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that has a production to that terminal.\n\nSo, let me go through each 't' in the string and see if they have corresponding production rules.\n\nLet's take the first token: t33.\n\nLooking in the grammar, is there any production where NTx -> t33? Scanning through:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT31 -> t35 (but that's t35, not t33)\n\nLooking through all NT31 productions, do any produce t33?\n\nLooking at NT31's productions:\n\nNT31 -> t69\nNT31 -> t69 (another)\nNT31-> t63\nND31-> t52\nND31-> t70\nND31-> t35 (again)\nSo, no, t33 is not a terminal in any of NT31's productions. Wait, what about other NTs?\n\nWait, I see NT15 has a production to t42, but that's t42. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for t33, I don't see any NT that directly produces t33 from the productions. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check all NTs for producing any 't' terms.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\nNT15: has t71, t35, t68, t19.\n\nNT23: t34, t70, t21, t74.\n\nWait, does any NT produce t33?\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t40\n\nND17->t68\n\nND24->t79\n\nND25->t64\n\nND24->t17\n\nND15->t19\n\nND6->t53\n\nND1->t6\n\nND0->t71\n\nND22->t3\n\nND2->t8, but ND2 also has other terms.\n\nWait, looking for t33, perhaps in the further productions.\n\nLooking through all NTs' productions for t33:\n\nLooking through each NT's productions:\n\nNT15: t71, t35, t68, t19.\n\nNo t33.\n\nNT23: t34, t70, t21, t74.\n\nNo.\n\nND17: t68.\n\nND24: t72, t73 (I think ND24 has t72 multiple times, but no t33).\n\nND25: t64.\n\nND22: no t's except 't71' isn't in any of its productions I thought.\n\nWait, perhaps in the start NT's:\n\nS->NT32 NT14.\n\nLooking for t32, which is in S's production as NT32.\n\nWhere does NT32 produce? Let's see: in the grammar, NT32 has t75.\n\nSo S -> NT32 NT14 can generate t75... but the string starts with t33, not t75.\n\nSo that suggests that the string's first token, t33, cannot be generated directly from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, unless the derivation goes through some steps. But in CNF, for S to generate a string that starts with t33, there must be a production that includes NT33 in the beginning. But in the grammar, I don't see any NT being defined as NT33. Maybe NT33 has a production to some non-terminal?\n\nWait, looking in the grammar:\n\nI see NT31 and NT15 have t35 and others, but no NT33.\n\nWait, checking the grammar in the user message:\n\nLooking through, I see NT15 -> 't35' and ND15 has several t's, but none is t33.\n\nSimilarly, NT31 has t35 in its productions, but again, not t33.\n\nLooking for NT33: Let's check each non-terminal name to see if any is NT33.\n\nLooking through the NTs listed: I see NT32, NT30, NT24, etc. No NT33.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t33, but there's no NT33 in the grammar, then that would mean that this string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps there is an NT33 that I missed.

{"custom_id":"request-543","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like \"t35 t3 t70...\" and so on. \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the grammar consists of. Looking at the grammar rules, they all seem to be of the form A \u2192 BC, which is the Chomsky normal form. This means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side. Also, I notice that some of the rules are terminals, like 't35' or 't1'. So these terminals are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S, which branches into NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, both of which are combinations of non-terminals.\n\nSince this is a context-free grammar, I can parse the string by breaking it down into the production rules. I might need to build a parse tree or use a method like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not very familiar with CYK, so maybe I'll try a recursive approach.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t35, which is a terminal. I need to see if any production rule for a non-terminal starts with t35. Scanning through the grammar rules, I spot that some non-terminals have terminals as their right-hand sides. Wait, for example, NT15 -> 't71' or 't35'. So, for NT15, it can produce 't71' or 't35'. \n\nHmm, the string starts with t35, so maybe the starting symbol S can produce something that starts with t35. Let's check the productions for S. S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Neither of these directly produce t35, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals in these productions can expand into t35.\n\nLooking at NT32: I don't see it directly in the string, but wait, I see NT31 -> t35. So maybe NT31 can produce t35, but how do I get to NT31 from the starting symbol?\n\nWait, S starts as NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. From the given grammar, NT32 can produce other things, like NT21 NT17 or something else. Let me check NT32's productions. Oh, actually, I see some NT32 productions: NT32 -> NT12 NT7, which can lead to t53 (if NT12 can expand that way), or NT32 -> t75 (from NT21? Wait, no, NT32 also has NT21 NT17. Wait, no, NT32's rules are: looking through the grammar, I don't see NT32. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT31 -> t35, but no direct NT32. Wait, maybe I need to follow the rules step by step. Let's take the string and see how it can be broken down.\n\nThe string starts with t35, which must come from NT15 \u2192 't35'. So the first symbol is from NT15. Then the next symbol is t3. t3 is another terminal. Let's check if any non-terminal produces t3. I see NT3 -> t1, but that's not t3. Wait, looking through the rules, I notice NT24 -> t12, which is t12, not t3. Maybe t3 comes from another rule. Wait, looking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t3. That's a problem. Because if t3 is in the string, and there's no production that generates t3, then the string cannot be produced.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through the entire grammar again to see if any non-terminal produces t3 or t9 or t18, etc. Looking at all the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce t's, like NT24 \u2192 t17, NT30 \u2192 t26, NT17 \u2192 t68, etc., but I don't see any that produce t3 or t9. There's a rule NT7 \u2192 t1, but no t3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's list all the rules where a non-terminal is directly producing a t:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71', 't35'\n- NT19 -> 't1', 't15'\n- NT29 -> 't28', 't24', 't62'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT6 -> 't53', 't27'\n- NT5 -> 't68', 't27'\n- NT17 -> 't68', 't82', 't71', 't19', 't35', 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't19', 't34', 't70', 't23'\n- NT24 -> t12, t17, t24 (various)\n- NT31 -> t35, t22, t33, t69\n- NT33 -> t22, t11\n- NT25 -> t64, t30 (wait, I think I see a mistake earlier)\n- NT0 -> t40, t71, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT24's rules include t12, t17, etc., but none of them produce t3. So t3 is a terminal that doesn't appear as a direct production of any non-terminal. Which means the string is invalid because t3 cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The string is: t35 t3 t70 t84 t71 t72 t70 t56 t70 t19 t34 t17 t42 t33 t17 t79 t77 t15 t68 t64 t19 t71 t1 t34 t52 t75 t62 t46 t46.\n\nThe second symbol is t3, which I can't find any production rule that ends with t3. So regardless of what other rules are, this t3 is impossible.

{"custom_id":"request-544","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the grammar provided. Let me start by understanding what I have here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it makes certain parsing and analysis methods easier. Each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the base cases which might have terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, every rule's right-hand side has exactly two symbols, which fits CNF.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The entire string starts with 't79' and ends with 't40', and there are 20 tokens in total. The question is whether these tokens can be derived by the given grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules to see which produce terminals, as the string is all terminals (all 't' followed by numbers). The initial symbol is S, which is a non-terminal. So, I need to see if, starting from S, I can derive this string through the given rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nEach of NT14 and NT18 have their own productions. I'll need to follow the derivations step by step. But this seems a bit tedious because the string is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Perhaps using a top-down approach starting from S and seeing if I can break down the string into parts that match the rules.\n\nThe string is: 't79 t59 t40 t17 t79 t49 t42 t79 t82 t77 t19 t40 t62 t25 t42 t64 t77 t56 t49 t40 t65 t22 t42 t69 t12 t78 t65 t15 t62'\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused with the count. Let me recount: I count 21 tokens, but I might have miscounted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string is: t79, t59, t40, t17, t79, t49, t42, t79, t82, t77, t19, t40, t62, t25, t42, t64, t77, t56, t49, t40, t65, t22, t42, t69, t12, t78, t65, t15, t62. That's 30 tokens. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, but to make progress, I think perhaps using memoization or dynamic programming for CYK parsing would be efficient. But given that I'm doing this manually, I need to find a way to break it down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the string is in the language by seeing if each token is a terminal and if the sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the NT rules produce other NTs. I think it's going to be very time-consuming to derive all these tokens manually. Wait, perhaps there's a pattern or regular expression that can be matched by the grammar?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is designed to generate a particular structure, like a binary tree or something related to tiling. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each token is generated by any of the NT rules, especially the production rules for each NT that produce the given tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, let's see which NT rules produce the terminal tokens in the string.\n\nFor example, let's take the first token, 't79'. Looking at the grammar, is there any NT whose production includes 't79'? Scanning the right-hand sides of all rules, it seems that NT24 has a production to 't79' in a couple of cases. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT1 (I think I saw this earlier)\n- NT24 -> 't79' appears in:\nWait, the rules list shows:\n- NT24 -> 't79' is in multiple places? Wait no, looking again:\n\nWait in the grammar provided, I see:\n\n1. NT24 -> 't79' appears in:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> 't79' is one of the rules.\n\nSo, for example, NT24 can produce 't79' when it's on the right-hand side.\n\nSimilarly, I can check each terminal token in the string to see if it's produced by any of the NT rules.\n\nSo the string has tokens like t79, t59, t40, t17, etc. So I need to see if each of these is a terminal, and whether those non-terminals (NTs) have production rules that can generate them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see if the entire string can be derived by the grammar through some series of steps.\n\nBut considering the string is 30 tokens long, this might be too tedious. Maybe I can think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the initial S, it can generate two possible initial branches: S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string must be produced by NT32 and NT14. Wait, the first token is 't79', so if S is NT32 followed by NT14, then the string's first two tokens should be the results of NT32 and NT14.\n\nLet me check: the string starts with t79, t59.\n\nIf S produces NT32 NT14, then NT32's expansion must start with t79, and NT14 must expand to start with t59.\n\nAlternatively, if S produces NT18 NT32, then the first two tokens would be from NT18 and NT32, which may not be the case here since the first tokens are t79 and t59.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nWait the first two tokens are 't79' and 't59'. So either:\n\n- NT32 -> 't79' and NT14 -> 't59'\n\nOR\n\n- NT18 -> 't79' and NT32 -> 't59' (if S uses the second production S -> NT18 NT32)\n\nWait, but let's see if any of the NT rules produce 't79' and 't59'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think NT24 can produce 't79' as per the rules.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't59'. I need to check if any NT has a production rule that includes 't59'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see \"NT23 -> 't34' NT4\", and other rules. Hmm, not seeing 't59' yet. Alternatively, perhaps NT24 can produce 't59'? Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT14 and NT15 have 't's in their productions:\n\n- NT14 -> 't71' (twice)\n- NT15 -> 't35', 't43', 't68', 't71', 't84'\n\nSo maybe NT15 could generate 't59'? Wait, are there any rules in the grammar where NT15 produces 't59'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see NT15 having a production that includes 't59'. So perhaps 't59' is not produced by any NT. Wait, but the string has 't59' as the second token. That suggests that in the parsing, the second token comes from NT14, which might have a production.\n\nWait, in the second production of S, S -> NT18 NT32. So if S uses NT18 -> 'something' and NT32 -> 'something else', maybe the second token is 't59' from NT18.\n\nSo looking for rules where NT18 produces 't59'. But I don't see any rule where NT18 is a non-terminal that produces 't59' specifically. All the rules seem to have specific combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the entire string can't be generated because one of the tokens doesn't appear in any rule as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, all the tokens in the string are 't' followed by numbers like t79, t59, t40, etc. So I need to check if each of these is a terminal produced by some NT rule.\n\nSo let's list all the tokens in the string: t79, t59, t40, t17, t79, t49, t42, t79, t82, t77, t19, t40, t62, t25,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S which can be a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which in the grammar is defined as S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Since S is a non-terminal, and the initial productions have S on the left, the string to test must start with a sequence derived from S.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t77`, which is a terminal, right?

The rules seem to produce other non-terminals. Only the symbols in the end (like t77, t3, t33, etc.) are terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar provided, the only terminal labels I can see are from the rules where NTs are replaced by terminal t's or individual letters like 't77', 't3', etc. Wait, no, this appears to be a specific grammar where the NTs produce specific strings of terminals or other NTs.\n\nWait, but looking at the production rules, none of the NTs directly produce a terminal string. That's not possible because a CFG must have at least one rule that terminates. Wait, looking again, I might have misread.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some rules are assignments like NT4 \u2192 't56', but actually, looking at the provided grammar, some rules produce specific 't' terms. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't59'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't21'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n- NT2 \u2192 't80'\n- NT12 \u2192 't78'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT2 \u2192 't49'\n- NT30 \u2192 't26'\n- NT21 \u2192 't69'\n- NT17 \u2192 't82'\n- NT10 \u2192 't42'\n- NT18 \u2192 't74'\n- NT23 \u2192 't19'\n- NT22 \u2192 't3'\n- NT14 \u2192 't43'\n- NT3 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT24 \u2192 't12'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT30 \u2192 't63'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77'\n- NT17 \u2192 't65'\n- NT33 \u2192 't52'\n- NT29 \u2192 't62'\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT24 \u2192 't17'\n- NT17 \u2192 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n- NT0 \u2192 't32'\n- NT24 \u2192 't79'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT31 \u2192 't35'\n- NT19 \u2192 't15'\n- NT23 \u2192 't70'\n- NT31 \u2192 't22'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't84'\n- NT13 \u2192 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't80'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, that's better. So, in the grammar, each production either breaks down into non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, NT27 \u2192 't77', etc. So some rules directly lead to specific terminal letters like 't77', 't3', etc.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the entire string must be a concatenation of the terminals produced by the start symbol S and its productions.\n\nNow, the start symbol S in the grammar has two productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo the derived string will start with either the symbols from NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nStarting with the given string: `t77 t3 t33 t74 t21 t15 t63 t80 t28 t74 t77 t25 t77 t64 t49 t46 t43 t82 t43 t49 t72 t25 t25 t68 t53 t1 t42 t56 t19 t49`.\n\nWait, let me check the first few tokens: t77, t3, t33, t74, etc.\n\nLet me see what t77 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT27 \u2192 't77'. So that's a terminal. So to get t77, we need an NT27.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar for NT27: indeed, NT27 \u2192 't77'. So the derivation must come from NT27.\n\nSo somewhere, the parser must have derived NT27, which then contributes 't77' to the string.\n\nNow, tracing back: since S\u2192NT32 NT14 and S\u2192NT18 NT32, let's see which one could produce the first t77.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production for S is NT32 and NT14.\n\nSo let's see where NT32 can come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT32 is produced by NT4 \u2192 't56' as per the provided rules.\n\nWait, no, looking more closely, actually, NT4 is produced by some other NT.\n\nWait, let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, the rules for NT4 are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT32\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nSo NT4 can be either NT7 NT32 or a terminal 't56'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the production rules are indeed in CNF since each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided seems to consist entirely of terminals (like 't1', 't28', etc.), which suggests that some of the productions in the grammar must end up producing these terminals. I should probably start by identifying the terminals in the grammar and see if they line up with the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, some terminals appear as 't' followed by numbers, such as 't1' to 't91' or more. It looks like each terminal is a specific symbol, so each production can generate a specific terminal. \n\nNext, I should note that the grammar contains a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, the start symbol S has productions like S \u2192 NT30 NT32, so S is a non-terminal, and NT30, NT32 are other non-terminals. These non-terminals, in turn, produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given starts with 't12', which suggests that one of the productions must lead to 't12'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT6 generates 't53', NT17 't46', NT19 't15', NT24 't12', and so on. There's a high chance that NT24 could produce 't12' because in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 and also NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 and NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13, etc. Wait, in the provided context, I see multiple rules for NT24. Wait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT24:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT15\n- NT24 \u2192 NT33 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nWait, no, in the initial provided grammar, under NT24, there are several rules. For example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT17 NT25\n\nAnd others.\n\nWait, but this shows that NT24 can produce different combinations. Looking at the string, 't12' appears once at the beginning. So if 't12' is the result of NT24 \u2192 't12 ...', then I need to see if NT24 can derive 't12'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT15. So if NT12 is a terminal, it would produce 't12'. Let me find 't12' in the grammar.\n\nYes, looking at the productions, NT12 has the production rule 'NT12 \u2192 NT6 NT4'.\n\nBut wait, is 't12' a terminal? Alternatively, looking at the list of terminals, I see 't12' is present. Specifically, in the terminal productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't53'?\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each rule that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rules that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35', 't68', 't1'\n\nWait, actually, looking more closely:\n\nThe rule I see includes several terminal productions, such as:\n\nNT19 \u2192 't15', 't68', but wait, in the provided grammar, for example, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't21', 't28', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting mixed up. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule on the right-hand side is either another non-terminal or a terminal in bold. For example:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT32 (both NT, so two-step non-terminals)\n\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32 (Nones terminals)\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30 (non-terminal recursion)\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6 ('t25' perhaps)\n\nWait, in the list of rules, some of the right-hand sides are in quotes, indicating terminals. For example:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34', 't59' \u2014 so this means NT23 can produce either 't34' or 't59'.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 't35', 't68', 't1', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 \u2192 't28', 't10', 't33' (look under NT13 in the rules):\n\nNT13 \u2192 't28', 't10', 't33'.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see terms like 't1', 't2', etc. So I need to see if the grammar includes these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the non-terminals produce the terminals. For example, NT23 \u2192 't34', which is a terminal. So NT23 can produce 't34'.\n\nBut the string given starts with 't12', which is not in the immediate list of terminals. So maybe I need to trace back from 't12' to see if it can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that 't12' is a terminal, and does any NT produce it as a terminal? Let me search the productions for any that have 't12' as a production.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I see:\n\nNT12: Looking for 't12' in the productions, perhaps.\n\nWait, in the provided production rules for NT12:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't53' (Wait, no. Let me scan the rules:\n\nWait, the grammar seems extensive, so I need to parse it carefully.\n\nI see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't21', 't28', 't35', etc.\n\nNT19 \u2192 't15', 't68'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34', 't59'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't62'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't11', 't14'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't52'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, does any production for a non-terminal result in 't12'? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT6 NT4.\n\nNo, it's a production of 't53'.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I missed it.

{"custom_id":"request-588","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given grammar generates the provided string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. The string provided is quite long, so I can't process it all manually. Let me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, which can produce two NT terminals, either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So, the string must be structured around these starting points. The string starts with 't32', which is a terminal. Let me check where 't32' appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules I see NT3 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't40', NT23 -> 't34', NT30 -> 't26', NT27 -> 't77', NT17 -> 't68', NT13 -> 't28', NT2 -> 't28', NT0 -> 't71', and several others. Wait, I don't see 't32' being a direct terminal in the grammar rules. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check again. I see rules like S -> NT32 NT14, which suggests that NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals. But in the string, the first symbol is 't32', which is a terminal. If NT32 isn't a terminal and doesn't produce any of the terminals provided, then 't32' would be unattainable. Alternatively, maybe 't32' is a terminal introduced as part of the production rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT32 is on the left side of a production, but I don't see any production that directly expands NT32 to any terminal except in S. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking back, S produces NT32 NT14 and NT18 NT32. So, 't32' as the first symbol would have to come from NT32, but if NT32 doesn't have a production that directly leads to a terminal, that's a problem. Or perhaps NT32 can only produce non-terminals that lead to 't32' through other rules.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a parse tree for the given string. The string starts with 't32', so let's see where 't32' can come from in the grammar. If no rule produces 't32' directly, then the string can't start with 't32'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any terminal 't32' except in the S rule, which is only part of the start symbol. So if the first symbol is 't32', that would require that NT32 directly produces 't32', but I don't see such a rule. All NT32 does is expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me list out the possible terminals from the grammar. I see 't1', 't7', 't12', 't13', 't14', 't17', 't18', 't22', 't23', 't24', 't25', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't32', 't34', 't35', 't37' is not there, 't40', 't42', 't43', 't46', 't49', 't52', 't53', 't56', 't59', 't62', 't63', 't64', 't65', 't67' perhaps not, 't71', 't72', 't75', 't77', 't80', 't82', 't84'.\n\nWait, but looking again, I don't see 't32' as a direct terminal in any of the NT productions. So if the first symbol is 't32', that suggests that NT32 must produce 't32', but since in the grammar, NT32 is defined as NT3 NT30, which further breaks down into other non-terminals, it seems impossible. So, unless NT32 can eventually produce 't32', which it doesn't directly, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the starting point wrong. The string is long, so perhaps the initial 't32' is part of a larger expansion. Wait, but S produces either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, which then are non-terminals. So the string must start with these combinations. But since the string starts with 't32', which isn't directly produced by NT32 or NT14, perhaps the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something in the grammar. Let me check if any NT32 expansion could lead to 't32'. Let's see, NT32 -> NT3 NT30. NT3 -> 't1', NT30 -> NT2 NT22. NT2 -> NT22 NT15, and so on. I don't see a path that leads from NT32 to 't32' through these rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start symbol S can produce S-> NT18 NT32, and then through expansions, 't32' can appear somewhere in the string. But the string starts with 't32', which would need to be the first symbol, which is only possible if 't32' is the first terminal in the expansion.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is impossible because 't32' isn't present as a terminal in the grammar. If that's the case, the answer would be No. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe I should check the grammar for any NT that could derive 't32'. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT production that directly or indirectly leads to 't32' except possibly NT2, but NT2 is NT24 NT15, which further breaks down. No, I don't see 't32' coming from any production. So, the string starts with 't32', but according to the grammar, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the non-terminals have productions leading to other non-terminals, except for a few that produce terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and many NT... produce other NT..., but some directly produce letters like 't' and others like 't1', 't2', etc. \n\nThe input string is `t17 t53 t42 t32 t33 t53 t80 t68 t52 t49 t35 t84 t65 t74 t17 t3 t62 t56 t22 t72 t79 t80 t84 t79 t25 t21 t1 t56 t74 t12 t19 t22`. Splitting this into tokens, I see it's a sequence of terminals.\n\nNow, starting from the start symbol S, I need to see if there's a derivation path that produces this string. \n\nIn CNF, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal must appear directly in a production, possibly after some others.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll try to see if each terminal is produced directly by some non-terminal. For example, 't1' is produced by NT23 \u2192 't1' (I think). Let me check the grammar: yeah, NT23 has a production NT23 -> 't34', NT23 -> 't21', NT23 -> 't1'. So 't1' is a terminal directly produced.\n\nSimilarly, 't53': looking at the grammar, I see NT1's production: NT1 -> NT23 NT5. But NT5 can produce 't68' among others (NT5 -> 't68'). Hmm, maybe somewhere else. Wait, looking for NT that directly produce 't53'. From the grammar, NT11 has a production NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT22, but that doesn't produce 't53'. Checking other NTs: NT6 has NT6 \u2192 NT18 NT27, but NT27 doesn't produce 't53'. Wait, maybe NT17: NT17 \u2192 't68', which is 't68' in the string is present, but 't53' is another.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for NT that directly produce 't53'\u2014let me scan the productions. Oh, I see NT24 has a production to 't53' under NT24 \u2192 't31' NT6 may be involved, but not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for production rules that directly produce the terminals present in the string. \n\nFirst, let's list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt17, t53, t42, t32, t33, t53, t80, t68, t52, t49, t35, t84, t65, t74, t17, t3, t62, t56, t22, t72, t79, t80, t84, t79, t25, t21, t1, t56, t74, t12, t19, t22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals can directly produce these terminals. For example:\n\n- t1: NT23 \u2192 't1'\n- t3: NT22 \u2192 't3'\n- t56: NT24 \u2192 't56'\n- t53: Need to find which NT produces t53. Looking at the rules, is there any? Scanning through, I see NT1 has NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5, and NT5 has NT5 \u2192 't68', so maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe another NT has a production to 't53', but I don't see it. Wait, the given grammar doesn't seem to have a production that directly yields 't53'... Hmm, but wait, maybe through another path. Or perhaps the string contains a terminal that isn't present in any production's terminal set, which would mean the string isn't generated.\n\nWait, the string has 't53' which I'm not seeing as a direct production from any NT. Let me check the grammar rules again carefully.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40' (but in the string, 't40' isn't present)\n- NT22 \u2192 't3'\n- NT23 \u2192 't1', 't21', 't34'\n- NT24 \u2192 't17', 't25', 't53', 't62', 't79', 't12', 't42', 't33', 't72', 't9', 't21', etc. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT24 has a production to 't72' and 't56', but does it have 't53'? Let's check: looking at NT24 productions, yes, I see NT24 \u2192 't72' and NT24 \u2192 't56'. But wait, in the string, 't53' appears. Is NT24 producing 't53'? No, the given grammar doesn't have such a production. So that's a problem. If the string includes 't53', but there's no NT rule that produces 't53' directly, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a production. Scanning through all NT24 \u2192 't31' which leads to 't35' or 't69', etc. No 't53' there.\n\nSo if 't53' is in the string and the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces 't53', then the string is not generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string to evaluate is `t71 t6 t34 t33 t68 t75 t28 t70 t43 t63 t70 t42 t6 t75 t26 t65 t72 t63 t63 t78 t12 t34 t43 t82 t62 t71 t46 t65 t75 t69 t6 t46`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can go to a terminal. Looking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals expand into two other non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but some directly go to a single terminal. For example, NT15 can be 't71', 't35', or 't33', and several others like NT0, NT2, NT7, etc., have terminal productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately produces either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't71', which I see in the production of NT15, which is rewritten to 't71'. Then 't6' is in NT34 as 't6', and 't34' is NT34 as 't34'. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't71'. Looking at the grammar, NT15 can be 't71'. So perhaps this is produced from NT15.\n\nBut where does NT15 come from? In the grammar, S can only produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the production tree starts with S, which branches into two non-terminals, either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. So the entire string must be a sequence of symbols derived from these initial branches.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't71 t6 ...'. Let me see the possible production for 't71'. From the grammar, NT15 can be 't71' (alongside 't35' and 't33'), so 't71' comes from NT15. But how does NT15 get into the string?\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps somewhere deeper in the parse tree, we have a NT15 leading to 't71'. But let's see the string: after t71, it's t6, t34, etc. Let me see if I can find a chain that leads to these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a concatenation of several terminals, each of which comes from a production rule. So I need to check that each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal production in the grammar and that the entire sequence can be derived from either S1 = NT32 NT14 or S2 = NT18 NT32.\n\nLet me list all the 't's in the string:\n\nt71, t6, t34, t33, t68, t75, t28, t70, t43, t63, t70, t42, t6, t75, t26, t65, t72, t63, t63, t78, t12, t34, t43, t82, t62, t71, t46, t65, t75, t69, t6, t46.\n\nWait, no, the string is just a sequence without spaces between tokens, so it's t71 t6 t34 t33 t68 ... etc., each as separate tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' symbol is a terminal, like NT15 is 't71', 't35', 't33', etc. So in the string, each 't' like t71 is a terminal derived from the non-terminal NT15. Similarly, t6 is from NT1, because in the grammar, NT1 is 't6'.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built by a series of terminals, each from some production. Let me see the sequence:\n\n1. t71 (NT15 \u2192 t71)\n2. t6 (NT1 \u2192 t6)\n3. t34 (NT34 \u2192 t34)\n4. t33 (NT33 \u2192 t33)\n5. t68 (Looking at the grammar: NT16 is t68? Wait, no. Looking through, NT61 isn't listed, but wait, the grammar's production NT23 \u2192 't34' is one, but I'm looking for 't68'. Wait, looking at the list, I don't see any NT directly producing 't68'. Hmm, maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar. The NT productions that go to terminals are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t71, t35, t33\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT23 \u2192 t34, t33 (from NT23 \u2192 't34' and NT23 \u2192 't21'?)\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 has two productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\nNT23 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I think the correct list is:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has several NT23 productions, for example:\n\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT23 -> 't21'\n\nAnd also NT23's:\n\nWait, for NT7: NT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT23 -> 't34', 't21'\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look at all terminal productions:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n- NT6 \u2192 t53\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT15 \u2192 t71, t35, t33\n- NT2 \u2192 t80, t8, t28, etc. Wait, let me list all terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t6\n\nNT0 \u2192 t40\n\nNT23 \u2192 t34, t21, t70, t69\n\nNT15 \u2192 t71, t35, t33\n\nNT3 \u2192 t1\n\nNT5 \u2192 t68\n\nNT19 \u2192 t1, t21, t15\n\nWait, no, let's find all the NTs that have a direct terminal:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t71, t35, t33\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34, t21, t70, t69\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t53\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34, t21\n\nWait, it's a bit confusing, but from the list, I think:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t53\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34, t21\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t12, t1\n\nWait, no, let me look at each production:\n\nLooking through, the ones that directly go to a single terminal are:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34, t21, t70, t69 (from the grammar lines)\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't21'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't70'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't69'\n\nAlso, NT2 \u2192 't80', 't28', etc., but perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, actually, in the list provided, every time a non-terminal is used with a terminal, it's a terminal production.

{"custom_id":"request-625","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm presented with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume represent non-terminal and terminal symbols used in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which leads directly to terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each rule has exactly two non-terminals, except when the start symbol is allowed to produce a single terminal. But in this case, the start symbol is S, and its productions are all two non-terminals. Wait no, looking at the grammar, all rules on the left are S \u2192 NT... or S \u2192 NT..., so each is two non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait. Actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So I should check each production here to see if it follows that structure. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT32 is a production of two non-terminals, but looking at the rest, the other productions like NT32 \u2192 NT14... Wait, actually, some of these non-terminals have productions that are two non-terminals or one non-terminal. Wait, but that should be allowed in CNF because NT productions can lead to more productions until terminals are reached.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, for example, NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT32 is a production of two non-terminals. NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30 is a production where one side is a non-terminal that leads to itself. Hmm, that might be problematic because that could lead to infinite loops in derivation, but perhaps it's allowed as a shorthand.\n\nWait, but I'm not here to check the grammar's correctness, just whether it can generate the given string. So perhaps I can proceed by trying to parse the string through the grammar.\n\nThe string given is: `t32 t68 t1 t59 t80 t68 t56 t15 t84 t25 t53 t15 t33 t59 t42 t52 t17 t71 t65 t72 t43 t15 t3 t53 t21 t75 t17 t56 t19 t52 t34 t82 t19`.\n\nEach token is a terminal, and we need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But in the given grammar, looking at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo the start symbol can replace to either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t32. From S, that can come from either S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So NT32 \u2192 t32, but in the grammar, NT32 has a production NT32 \u2192 NT14 NT32, which would mean if NT32 is t32, then it must be replaced by NT14 followed by NT32. But that would create a problem here because t32 comes from NT32, which requires a non-terminal that can't be a terminal immediately, unless NT32 has a direct production to a terminal, which I don't see in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, are there any rules that end with a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n\nWait, is there any NT that has a production rule that ends with a terminal?

So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, except some are terminals like NT5 \u2192 't71' or 't35'. Wait, no, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar actually has all productions where the RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, NT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6, etc. So all productions are CNF, which is good.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of terminals, all of which are 't' followed by a number. So the string is a sequence of tokens, each being a terminal symbol. My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One method is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length should correspond to a specific number of steps based on the number of non-terminals and the productions. But since the grammar isn't provided in a tree form, perhaps building a parse tree would help, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can perform a top-down parsing by starting at the start symbol S and trying to substitute according to the productions, aiming to derive the given string. However, with 33 tokens, this process could get quite lengthy.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each terminal in the string can be matched by the RHS of the productions. For example, if a production ends with a terminal, like NT5 \u2192 't71', then that end of the string must match 't71', but looking at the end of the given string, the last token is 't40', which doesn't match any of the terminal productions I see.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the grammar here has a lot of rules\u2014like over 100 non-terminals and terminals like 't' followed by numbers and some 't's without numbers. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't's and numbers, specifically: `t34 t22 t74 t71 t74 t52 t52 t63 t25 t68 t3 t63 t82 t80 t21 t63 t74 t21 t68 t35 t77 t32 t59 t77 t25 t80 t77 t75 t22 t35 t84 t74 t28 t84`.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production rule is two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal on the left? Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this case, all rules have exactly two symbols on the right, either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, some of the rules don't just have two symbols\u2014like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals. NT32 is a non-terminal, NT14 is another. Each non-terminal can be further expanded into other non-terminals or maybe a terminal.\n\nThe problem is, manually expanding all possible ways for such a long string would take forever. Maybe I can approach this by thinking about what the string represents in terms of the grammar's structure.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't's with numbers. Let me see if each 'tX' corresponds to a production that generates a terminal, or if there's a specific order.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, some of these 't's are connected to other 't's. For example, in the given grammar, there's a rule like NT28 -> NT15 NT30, but there are also terminal rules like NT19 -> 't1'. So each non-terminal that ends with a number is a terminal. So NT24 could eventually become a 't' string.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a bit more complicated because some non-terminals are defined as sequences of other non-terminals that eventually resolve into terminals.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to see if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar. Starting from the beginning of the string, each token must correspond to a sequence derived from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The grammar has two rules for S: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the string must start with NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Looking at the string, it starts with t34. Wait, no\u2014the string starts with t34, but in the grammar, the non-terminals are things like NT32, which may produce t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The 't's in the string are terminals, so each of them must correspond to a rule where the non-terminal on the left produces that terminal. For example, looking at the grammar, there are rules like NT19 -> 't1', which means when NT19 is derivable, it can produce a 't1' terminal.\n\nSo, let's check the string. The first token is t34. Let's see if there's a rule where the non-terminal produces t34. Looking through the rules, I see NT24 -> 't72', NT15 -> 't68', NT13 -> 't28', etc. Wait, is there an NT that produces t34? Let me scan the rules.\n\nI see NT30 -> NT2 NT22, which might eventually produce t's if the following non-terminals lead to t's. Wait, no NT directly produces t34. Hmm, maybe t34 is derived from NT34, and NT34 has a rule that eventually leads to t34.\n\nLooking back, in the list of rules: there's NT34 -> NT24 NT18. NT24 can produce t72, and NT18 can produce t74, perhaps. So NT34 could produce t72 t74, which would make t72 t74. But the string starts with t34, so that doesn't match. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps t34 is part of a larger expansion. Let me check if there are any NT's that can produce 't34'. Looking through all the NT rules, the ones that end with 't' are ones like NT19 -> 't1', NT13 -> 't28', etc. But none have 't34'. So maybe t34 is obtained through a multi-step expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules again, for example, NT25 -> NT27 NT10. If NT27 leads to a terminal, or if NT10 leads to a terminal. Let's see: NT27 comes from NT0 -> NT23 NT18. NT23 could be broken down, but maybe eventually, each step eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion needs to be in reverse. Let me try to see the grammar's structure. If S is the start, it must produce two non-terminals. Let's see the first part of the string is t34 t22. So after S, the next two symbols must be the result of expanding the two non-terminals in S's production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t34 t22. So let's see what S can produce. S has two options: NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT32 followed by NT14 must produce t34 t22.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if there's a way for NT32 to derive t34 followed by something, and NT14 to derive t22.\n\nAlternatively, if S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then NT18 must produce t34 and NT32 must produce t22.\n\nBut wait, NT18 could be a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT18: let's see, the rules I see are NT18 \u2192 NT20 NT20 or NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT20, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of terminals, each token must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. So for each position in the string, we need to find a production that matches the current terminal and allows the rest of the string to be derived.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the overall length matches the grammar's possibilities. Context-free grammars can generate any length except for lengths that can't be formed by the rules. But this might not help so much.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is context-free and in CNF, the number of symbols should correspond to the derivation length. Each step of the CNF production (A\u2192BC) triples the number of symbols, but in our case, each step is a binary expansion, meaning each production adds one symbol. Wait, no\u2014each step in CNF splits a single non-terminal into two, so each step adds one to the length.\n\nWait, no: starting with S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the initial length is 1 (S). Each production step increases the length by 1 (since the left side is replaced by two symbols, so the number of symbols increases by 1 for each non-terminal expansion). But in this case, each non-terminal can produce either terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, for a string of length n, the derivation would be n-1 expansions, assuming each step adds one. So if the string has 32 terminals, that would require 31 expansions. That's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar's structure can be represented as a parse tree where each production adds exactly one symbol, so the string length must equal the number of productions plus one.\n\nSo the given string has 32 tokens, so the derivation would require 31 productions. I don't think that's the issue here, as the grammar can handle any string length beyond a certain point.\n\nBut perhaps the issue is that some sequences can't be formed because the grammar doesn't allow certain combinations.\n\nLet me see: looking at the string, the first token is t34. Let's see if t34 can be derived from any non-terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t34. So maybe t34 is obtained through a sequence of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps t34 is part"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-648","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, and the string to check is: `t84 t15 t6 t77 t53 t1 t12 t56 t68 t68 t21 t33 t12 t82 t75 t64 t42 t21 t74 t49 t21 t35 t69 t21 t52 t56 t70 t74 t28 t70 t43 t26 t70 t72`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the meaning of the terminals and non-terminals. The grammar consists of several production rules starting from S and N, where N might represent non-terminals and T could be terminals. But looking at the grammar, some symbols like t71 are explicitly provided with productions, so they are terminal symbols representing 't's followed by numbers.\n\nEach production rule in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, the start symbol S can derive other non-terminals, and eventually, terminals appear.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like t84, t15, etc. Some of these are terminals, and some are non-terminals, like NT30, NT4, etc.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar, checking if each token can be derived from the non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut manually doing this for a long string is time-consuming. Perhaps I can identify key tokens and check their productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t84. Let's see if there's a production that produces t84. In the grammar, I see NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't15'... Hmm, but I'm not seeing an explicit production for t84 yet. Let me check all the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production that directly starts with t84 except for NT15 and others. Maybe it's derived from a production like NT15 -> t15, but that's probably not right. Alternatively, maybe t84 is derived from NT7 -> 't40' but again, not matching. Wait, maybe t84 is part of a longer non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I notice that NT0 -> 't40', NT13 -> 't1', etc., but t84 is not present in the terminals. So perhaps t84 is part of a longer production. Let me look for rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some production rules have terminals on the right-hand side. For example, NT31 -> 't69', and other NT0 productions. But I also notice some rules, like NT17 -> 't68', NT13 -> 't80', etc., but I don't see a rule that starts with t84.\n\nWait, maybe t84 is part of a longer derivation. Maybe it's part of a non-terminal's expansion. For example, NT17 -> NT22 NT10, and NT10 could be t42, but that's not relevant to t84. Alternatively, maybe it's a deeper derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should identify the start symbol S and see how the string can be derived from it.\n\nS can be derived using S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. Each of these produces a combination of non-terminals. Let's consider S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nNT32 produces 't75' and 't21' via rules like NT32 -> NT2 -> 't28', but wait, NT32 has a production NT32 -> NT13 NT21, and NT13 -> 't28'. But perhaps I need to follow this more carefully.\n\nThis manual approach is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the string starts with t84, and none of the initial symbols can produce t84, so the entire string is invalid. But I'm not sure because perhaps t84 is part of a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire string must be a leftmost derivation starting from S. But without knowing the entire structure, it's tough.\n\nAnother angle: if any of the symbols in the string are not found in the terminals, it's invalid. Wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are all of the form t followed by numbers. So in the given string, all symbols are 't' followed by numbers, so all are terminals. That means the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which must be derived directly from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nBut S can't directly produce all the t's in the string because each S produces two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two more non-terminals, and so on, until the terminals appear.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the string is too long and contains symbols that can't be generated. For example, looking at the last part of the string: ...70 t74 t26 t70 t72. I can check if t70, t74, t26 are each terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a production that produces 't70' as a terminal, except perhaps none. Because most terminals are like 't71', 't35', etc., but not 't70'.\n\nWait, looking again: in the grammar, I see NT22 -> 't70', but that's a rule that says NT22 is replaced by 't70'. But 't70' is a terminal, so it can't be derived further. So, in the string, if there's 't70', it must come directly from NT22, which means the non-terminal NT22 was derived into 't70'.\n\nBut in the last part of the string, we have ...74 t70 t72. Wait, in the string provided, it's written as `...t70 t74 t26 t70 t72`. So, 't70' appears twice. Let's check if 't70' is present as a terminal. Yes, in the grammar, NT22 -> 't70'. So, the production for NT22 is 't70'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't26' and 't74'... from the grammar, 't26' comes from NT20, as NT20 -> 't26' (since NT20 -> 't26' is in the rules). Wait, looking: I see that NT20 -> 't26' (from NT20, but in the grammar, it's written as NT20 -> 't26'). And 't74' is from NT24 -> 't74' (if I recall correctly, though not explicitly written here, but perhaps derived from NT24 leading to 't74').\n\nHmm, looking back at the grammar, some terminals are explicitly mentioned as end products of non-terminals: for example:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't15'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT13 -> 't80'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- And others like NT22 -> 't70', etc.\n\nSo, some non-terminals directly produce these tXXXX terminals.\n\nIn the given string, we have 't84', which is not present in any terminal production. Therefore, perhaps t84 is not derivable from the grammar, making the entire string invalid. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production that allows a non-terminal to derive into t84. But scanning the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't84' as a terminal.\n\nThus, since at least one token in the string (t84) cannot be derived, the entire string is not generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is a set of production rules. Each rule starts with a non-terminal symbol and is followed by two other non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nNow, the given string has 42 tokens, all of which are 't' followed by numbers, except for the initial 't15' etc. So each token represents a terminal symbol like t1, t2, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see all the terminal symbols are things like t1, t2, up to t90 or so. But instead of trying to parse the entire string from the start, perhaps I can reverse engineer the string by trying to match it backwards with the grammar.\n\nWait, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can trace the possible derivations from the start symbol S and see if the string can be built up in some way.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar expands into two different options:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nEach of these non-terminals, NT32 and NT14, and NT18 and NT32, have their own production rules.\n\nLooking at the first option: NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT22, and NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So the production would be NT32 NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT22 NT31 NT21.\n\nContinuing, NT22 \u2192 NT21 NT18, NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT6, and NT24 has several rules. This is getting a bit involved.\n\nBut maybe instead of expanding fully, I should look for terminals in the string that match the leaves of these productions.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must derive it by choosing non-terminals that can produce these terminals. But in the grammar, the terminals don't appear on the left-hand side of any production, except perhaps for some NT rules. For example, looking at the grammar, some NT rules end with a terminal, like NT35 \u2192 't19'? Wait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nI see lines like `NT23 -> 't34'`, but more importantly, some NT entries have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT31 -> 't69'\n- And so on.\n\nAh, okay, so some non-terminals can produce terminal symbols as well. That means that in the derivation, at some point, a non-terminal might directly produce a 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, to generate the string, each 't' must come from a production rule where the non-terminal can produce that specific terminal.\n\nLet me look at each token in the string and see if there's a corresponding non-terminal in the grammar that can produce it.\n\nThe string is: t15, t22, t12, t72, t79, t40, t63, t84, t49, t69, t80, t65, t3, t34, t28, t82, t75, t34, t71, t26, t68, t15, t22, t49, t22, t22, t77, t21, t82, t43, t22, t19, t15, t12, t12.\n\nSo, I need to match each 't' to a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLet's list the possible non-terminals for each 't' token:\n\nt15: Looking at the grammar, NT33 \u2192 t52, NT15 \u2192 't35', 't59', 't43', 't21', or 't24'. Wait, in the grammar, I see rows like:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT15 -> 't35'\n- NT15 -> 't21'\n- NT15 -> 't9'\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't21', 't9'?\n\nWait, let me check again. The grammar provided includes:\n\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT28 -> 't82'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT29 -> 't62'\nNT25 -> 't64'\nNT24 -> 't17'\nNT17 -> 't25'\nNT8 -> 't46'\nNT0 -> 't32'\nNT24 -> 't79'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT23 -> 't70'\nNT31 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't53'\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't84'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't56'\n\nWait, that's a lot. So for 't15', looking for NT rules that produce 't15':\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT15 -> 't35'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n\nSo, the non-terminals that can produce 't15' are NT15 and NT19.\n\nSimilarly, for each 't' in the string, I can find possible NT sources.\n\nBut this seems tedious. Maybe a better approach is to consider the production rules and see if the string can be broken down into a series of steps that fit the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each non-terminal in the grammar has only certain terminals as possible outputs. So, starting from the string, I can try to group consecutive terminals into symbols that match some NT's production to a terminal.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that each production either introduces non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step introduces exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or vice versa). So, to generate the string, each step must cover all symbols, but this is complex.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for the structure of the string and seeing if it can fit into any of the production sequences from the start symbol.\n\nGiven that the string is a series of 't's, each of which presumably comes from NT rules that eventually terminate into a single 't'. So, the entire string must be the result of a series of productions where each non-terminal eventually produces the given 't's in sequence.\n\nWait, but without the full expansion, it's challenging to say. Maybe a better way is to consider that each 't' is the result of a non-terminal that terminates in that 't'. For example, t15 comes from NT15 or NT19. Let me check if there's a production path that can connect these.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be considered as a series of non-overlapping segments where each segment corresponds to a NT rule that produces a sequence of terminals. But it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps focusing on the starting point: S can expand into NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.

{"custom_id":"request-667","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of tokens: `t19 t32 t53 t26 t72 t3 t80 t56 t77 t28 t26 t12 t63 t33 t62 t77 t78 t15 t25 t59 t25 t1 t6 t46 t43 t34 t70 t40 t62 t46 t69 t70 t35 t68 t28`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), so each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. I notice that many non-terminals (like NT32, NT34, etc.) have productions that map directly to terminal tokens (like 't1', 't32', etc.). This suggests that the grammar is essentially a series of terminals connected through non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should probably map out the production rules and see how the terminals are linked. The start symbol is S, which can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the string must start with a sequence derived from either S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nThe string starts with t19, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, 't19' appears as a production from NT13. So perhaps the string starts with NT13. Wait, but the start symbol S doesn't produce NT13 directly. So S must produce something that, when combined with other rules, results in t19 t32 etc.\n\nHmm, another approach: Let's try to walk through the string and see if each token can be matched by some production.\n\nt19: NT13 can produce t19, so perhaps we can have NT13 \u2192 't19'. Then, the next token is t32, which is produced by NT32. So maybe after NT13, we have NT32. That would be t19 t32. Looking at the grammar, the first option for S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So if we take S \u2192 NT32, then the next symbol after S starts with NT32, which can produce t32, and then the second part would be NT14, which can produce t43. But the string starts with t19, not t32. So maybe S is derived via a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the production rules again. The only productions that produce 't' are when a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT13 can produce t19.\n- NT15 can produce t68 and t1 (two productions: NT15 \u2192 t68 and NT15 \u2192 t1).\n- NT9 can produce t49.\n- NT0 can produce t40 and so on.\n\nSo the string starts with t19, which is from NT13. Then we have t32, which comes from NT32.\n\nBut S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S starts with either NT32 or NT18. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first token after S is NT32 (t32), but our string starts with t19. So that's a problem. Alternatively, if S starts with NT18 (which produces t74), then the string would start with t74, but it's t19. So neither S production seems to match the start of the string.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the string is being built in such a way that multiple non-terminals are expanded to terminals through a series of productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, perhaps the non-terminals can produce multiple things, including other non-terminals. For example, NT24 can produce NT4 and NT20, but in the string, we have t72, which is a terminal from NT24. Similarly, NT4 can produce t56, but the string has t43, which is from NT15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with NT32 \u2192 t32, but the string starts with t19, which is NT13. So that suggests that the start symbol S isn't directly producing NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32 at the beginning.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Let me check the non-terminals that can lead to t19.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT13 can produce t19. NT13 is produced by which other non-terminals?\n\nLooking for NT13 in the grammar: I see production rules like NT23 \u2192 NT25 NT13, so maybe NT13 is inside a larger production path.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to get from S to NT13 as part of a production chain.\n\nS can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\nLooking at NT32's productions: NT32 \u2192 t32, so from NT32, we get t32.\n\nSimilarly, NT14: Let's check NT14's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT14 appears in several places, but looking for NT14 \u2192 t43? Wait, the terminal 't43' is from NT15. Let me check: NT15 \u2192 t68 and t1, but does any NT15 production produce t43? No. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, looking back, the terminal 't43' is mentioned in NT15's production. Let me check the grammar again. Oh no, I see: NT15 has the productions:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't68'\nNT15 \u2192 't1'\nNT15 \u2192 't82'\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, it was listed as NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34, etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed that NT15 can directly produce 't43'?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT15, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't1' (twice), 't68', 't25', 't29', 't33', etc. Wait, let's check if any production of NT15 directly leads to t43.\n\nWait, maybe I should re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34, NT15 \u2192 NT29 NT20, etc. Also, looking for 't43' in NT15's productions: seems not. But wait, I see in the grammar:\n\nWait, the first user message has a long list of productions. Let me look for NT15.\n\nAt the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 -> 't1' (multiple times)\nNT15 -> 't82'\nWait, that can't be. Maybe I'm confused. Let me go through the grammar step by step.\n\nLooking for NT15:\n\nIn the grammar part, under NT15, the productions are:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't19'\nNT15 \u2192 't15'\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n\nWait, but earlier lines show different things. Wait, maybe it's better to look for 't43' and see if any NT produces it. Let me check the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't1' (twice)\n- NT23 \u2192 't46'\n- NT24 \u2192 't53', etc.\n\nWait, where is 't43' coming from? It's not directly as a terminal, but maybe via a production. Looking back, in the grammar, NT15 is a non-terminal that maps to 't43' somewhere. Wait, in the grammar message, I see:\n\nNT15 production:\nNT15 \u2192 't19'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't82'\n\nIs there a 't43'? Let me see:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, searching for 't43'.\n\nHmm, in the initial list, I don't see 't43' as a terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's given with production rules for various symbols like S, N, T, etc. I see that each production seems to pair two symbols, and some of them are terminal symbols (like t followed by numbers) or a bit of a mix.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t52 t72 t53 t82 t64 t3 t26 t80 t64 t64 t15 t32 t19 t59 t70 t53 t26 t26 t72 t43 t80 t62 t80 t26 t52 t59 t34 t46 t21 t15 t82 t84 t72 t15 t68 t77`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the production rules are in the form A -> B C, where B and C are non-terminals. Some rules have terminal symbols on the right-hand side. For example, S starts with NT32 and NT14, which are non-terminals. So, S is the start symbol, and the string must be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nThe key is to see if the string can be broken down into pairs of terminals and non-terminals that match the grammar's rules. Each token in the string can either be a terminal (like t52) or a non-terminal (like NT32).\n\nLet me list out the string components to see if they form a possible derivation:\n\nThe string is: t52, t72, t53, t82, t64, t3, t26, t80, t64, t64, t15, t32, t19, t59, t70, t53, t26, t26, t72, t43, t80, t62, t80, t26, t52, t59, t34, t46, t21, t15, t82, t84, t72, t15, t68, t77.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the rule S -> NT32 NT14 means the string should start with t's and non-terminals that eventually produce these. Let's see if the string starts with t52... Hmm, in the grammar, t52 is associated with NT25, as seen in NT25 -> NT27 NT30 and t53 is NT1 and t70 is NT0. So maybe t52 is derived from NT25, which could come from NT27 and NT30, etc. But I'm getting a bit lost.\n\nMaybe another approach is to parse the string step by step, ensuring that each part can be matched by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree would be binary, and each production is either a single non-terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking closer, the grammar seems to have some rules that directly output terminals, like NT6 -> NT18 NT27 and then some NT27 etc., but some of the terminals are like t52, t72, etc. So perhaps the string is built by expanding S through various rules, replacing non-terminals with either other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string represents a valid derivation. Let me check each step:\n\n- The string starts with t52. Looking at the grammar, in NT25 -> NT27 NT30, and t52 is in NT25. So that's NT25.\n\nBut how did NT25 get generated? It would come from its parents. Looking at NT5 in the grammar: NT5 -> NT27 NT21 and NT21 is NT20 NT20. Wait, this seems a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for patterns in the string and see if they can fit the grammar. For instance, if the string has sequences that match the production rules, like NT32 leading to t75 or something.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: because the grammar is in CNF, each production step reduces the number of symbols by one. So, starting from S, we have two symbols (non-terminals), then each step replaces one non-terminal with two, etc., until only terminals remain.\n\nBut that's getting too abstract. Maybe I can look for any known patterns or see if the string has any contradictions.\n\nWait, looking at the string, I see t64 multiple times. In the grammar, t64 is produced by NT25. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should write down the steps:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n   So, the string starts with t75 (NT32) and t74 (NT14).\n\nBut the string starts with t52, which is not t75 or t74. So maybe the derivation continues.\n\nWait, but NT14 in the grammar is part of the production S -> NT14. Looking at the grammar, NT14's production is nt14 -> nt28 nt20. Wait, no, looking at the grammar rules, I think I might have miscalculated.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, the production S can split into NT32 and NT14, which are each non-terminals. So the string should start with the terminals generated by NT32 and NT14.\n\nLooking at the NT14 rules, I see NT14 -> NT28 NT20, among others. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT14 has a production like NT14 -> NT31 NT21, etc., but I'm a bit overwhelmed by the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look up if t52 is a terminal. Wait, looking for t52 in the string, it appears multiple times. Checking the grammar, t52 is produced by NT17? Wait, no. Let me look: in the grammar, t52 is a terminal in which NT25 -> NT27 NT10, and t53 is NT1. Wait, perhaps t52 comes from NT25, which comes from NT27 and NT10, and so on.\n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should try to see if the string has any odd lengths or patterns that can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but the problem is that without properly parsing the string step by step, it's hard to tell.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, but since I'm verifying manually, I'll have to see if there's a derivation path for the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t6 t25 t68 t19 t53 t62 t46 t21 t63 t42 t35 t68 t19 t3 t6 t32 t17 t32 t43 t59 t70 t25 t33 t78 t42 t33 t1 t80 t59 t52 t1 t53 t59 t71 t69`.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of multiple productions starting with S, NT, and various terminal symbols. The terminals in the string start with 't', which are 't1', 't17', 't21', etc., and some non-terminals as well, like 't6', 't68', etc. Wait, no\u2014wait. Wait, the string has mixed terminals and non-terminals? Or is it all terminals?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the productions start with NT (non-terminal), but the string has 't's, which are terminals. So the grammar must have productions that replace non-terminals with sequences of terminals, possibly involving other non-terminals.\n\nI think the key is to see if the string can be broken down step by step by the rules in the grammar, starting from S and trying to expand non-terminals into terminals.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming, as the string is quite long. Let me start by identifying key non-terminals and their possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S can be expanded into NT32 followed by NT14, or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't17', so perhaps this comes from NT17?

However, looking at the string, the first token is 't17', so how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-703","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The string is long and made up of tokens like t26, t79, t68, and so on. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production is of the form A -> BC, except for the start symbol sometimes allowing a terminal.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the non-terminals in the grammar are NT followed by numbers (like NT32, NT22, etc.), except for some terminals (t's). So the grammar likely produces a sequence of these terminals. But wait, some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT15 -> 't71', so those are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nThe string starts with t26 and ends with t26, with various t's in between. I need to see if there's a way this string can be formed by the given production rules. Since it's a CNF grammar, each step produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but I think in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014 in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, which are two non-terminals, except the base cases where non-terminals can produce terminals? Or maybe some non-terminals produce terminals directly? Wait, in standard CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A and B are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. But here, looking at the grammar, I see several rules where NT followed by a number produces a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal followed by a non-terminal. So maybe some of these are not strict CNF? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is modified, but the user said it's in CNF, so maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nBut assuming that the grammar is in CNF except where a non-terminal can directly produce a terminal, which is allowed in CNF. So, each production is a start symbol expanding into two non-terminals, and some non-terminals can expand into a terminal and a non-terminal or both terminals. Hmm, no\u2014 in CNF, each production must be A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that in some cases, a production might have a terminal. Wait, no\u2014in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except the start symbol might produce a terminal. Or perhaps here, some non-terminals can produce a terminal, which would make this a slight variation but still a CFG in CNF.\n\nMoving on, the string is a sequence of terminals, each prefixed by t, like t26, t79, etc. I think each of these corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar, possibly.\n\nTo parse this string, I can model it as a series of steps where each non-terminal is replaced by two other symbols. Since the string is about 37 tokens long, it might require a certain depth in the parse tree. However, given the grammar's complexity, perhaps the optimal way is to model this as a binary tree where the string is built from the start symbol, and each step combines two nodes.\n\nBut rather than manually building the parse tree, perhaps I can look for key tokens in the string that can only be produced by specific non-terminals. For example, if the string contains 't26', I need to check which non-terminal can produce 't26'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT20 -> 't26', so NT20 can produce 't26'.\n\nLooking at the string, the third token is 't84'. I need to see who produces that. Checking the grammar, I see NT21 produces 't84' in NT21 -> 't84'. So if the string contains 't84', it could come from NT21.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the entire string is a sequence of terminals, which suggests that each of these is a leaf node in the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production must split into two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. But since the string is linear, the parse tree must have a structure that sequences these leaves in the correct order.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions. Given the string starts with t26, which comes from NT20, then the next is t79. So NT20 must produce t26 and something else, but since it's a terminal, perhaps that isn't possible. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. In the string, each 't' is part of the sequence, so each 't' corresponds to a non-terminal at some point. But in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, so in the parse tree, each internal node must have two children. Therefore, the string is a sequence of leaves, each produced by some non-terminal. But the problem is that the string is a specific sequence, so the parser must arrange them into such a structure.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a top-down parser using the given grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be decomposed into the rules present in the grammar. For instance, starting from the start symbol, S, which can produce either NT32 NT32 NT14, wait no, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32 NT14 (is that correct? Wait, the user provided the grammar as S -> NT32 NT32 or S-> NT18 NT32 or similar. Wait, let me re-express the grammar:\n\nThe user's grammar starts with S -> NT32 NT32 or S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, that's odd because S is a single symbol, and in CNF, S should produce two non-terminals. So perhaps it's a typo, and the user meant S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> something else. Wait, let me check the initial lines:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\n\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, that can't be right because S is the start symbol, and in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must be of the form X \u2192 YZ, where X, Y, Z are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. So perhaps the initial S productions are incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and these are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended S to produce two non-terminals, so the initial lines should have S -> NT32 NT14 or something similar. But as written, it's S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32, which are each S \u2192 NT32 NT32 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S is a non-terminal, and these are its productions. So the start symbol S can produce two non-terminals, each of which can then be expanded further.\n\nGiven that, the first step is to find in the string where S would split into two parts, each part being a sub-string that can be generated by each of the two non-terminals produced by S.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, it's a single sequence, so I think the initial parse would have the entire string as a concatenation of two sub-strings generated by each of the two non-terminals from S.\n\nBut the string is 37 tokens long, which is odd because each expansion should split the string into two, so 37 is an odd length, which suggests it might not be directly split into two equal parts. Wait, no, the string is a concatenation, not necessarily split in the middle.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me look for key tokens that can help me backtrack.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t26, which comes from NT20. So somewhere in the parse tree, there must be an NT20 node that produces t26 and something else. But since t26 is the first token, that something else must be matched by the next token, which is t79, which comes from NT24 and maybe NT21?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled.

{"custom_id":"request-709","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with a lot of non-terminals and productions. The string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and S also has another rule S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the start symbol S branches into two different non-terminals, each leading to more productions.\n\nEach of these non-terminals, like NT32, NT14, etc., have their own productions. For example, NT32 can split into NT2 and NT3, and each of those can further split into smaller non-terminals or terminals. Some of these, like NT3, NT7, NT1, etc., directly produce terminal tokens like 't1', 't2', etc. Others continue splitting into more non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is: `t80 t65 t1 t74 t43 t56 t70 t15 t63 t63 t84 t53 t56 t34 t21 t17 t82 t34 t52 t46 t12 t53 t84 t77 t40 t33 t28 t32 t3 t63 t35 t63 t32 t84 t65 t17 t56`.\n\nMy task is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll need to try to parse the string according to the grammar's productions.\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, the first split is into two non-terminals. Looking at the string, the first token is 't80'. So, I need to see if one of the productions can generate 't80'. Scanning the grammar, I see NT80 is not directly present, but looking at NT27's production: NT27 \u2192 NT21 NT77. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused with other parts.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals map directly to terminals. For instance, NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 't43'. Similarly, other NTs like NT25 \u2192 't64', NT17 \u2192 't68', and so on. So each occurrence of a non-terminal that maps directly to a terminal is a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each token must correspond to the result of a production. So starting from S, the string would be split into two parts, each part corresponding to the two productions from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t80. So perhaps one of the paths is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and the t80 comes from NT32 or NT14.\n\nLooking at NT14: from the grammar, NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Then, NT31 can be NT11 NT14. Wait, that might complicate things because it seems to be recursive. Wait, no, let's check again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t80. Looking through the productions, I don't see NT80 directly, but maybe it's generated via some path. Wait, there's a production NT80 \u2192 't80'? I don't think so. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT17 \u2192 't68', NT14 \u2192 't43', etc. So, to get t80, I need a non-terminal that directly maps to 't80'. Scanning through the list, I see that NT80 is not a terminal; the closest is NT31, which can be NT11 NT14, but does that map to 't80'? Wait, looking at the productions, NT24 can generate 't79' in one production and 't17' in another. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to map the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t80 t65 t1 t74 t43 t56 t70 t15 t63 t63 t84 t53 t56 t34 t21 t17 t82 t34 t52 t46 t12 t53 t84 t77 t40 t33 t28 t32 t3 t63 t35 t63 t32 t84 t65 t17 t56.\n\nIt's a long string, 40 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step reduces the string by breaking it into two parts. Starting from S, which splits into two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can split again, etc. So, the parsing would proceed by trying to match the leftmost token to the leftmost production, and so on.\n\nLet me see if I can find any non-terminal that directly produces 't80'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT47, NT96, etc., but nothing directly mapping to 't80'. Wait, maybe NT24 can produce 't79' and 't17'. Or NT27 \u2192 NT21 NT77, which if NT21 produces t63, then NT77 must produce t80? Wait, does NT77 produce t80? Let me check. NT77 is not a terminal; looking at the productions, NT24 \u2192 't79', 't17', etc. So no.\n\nWait, maybe it's generated via a longer path. Let's think about it: Maybe S is split into NT32 and NT14. NT32 is split into NT2 and NT3. NT2 is split into NT22 and NT15. NT22 is \u2192 NT3, NT18; but that seems to create a cycle. Hmm, this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree. Let's try to parse the first few tokens and see if it's possible.\n\nThe first token is t80. So we need a production that starts with t80. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing t80. So maybe the string starts with a production that isn't directly a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the first split of S is into two non-terminals, say A and B, and A is NT32 and B is NT14. NT14 can produce t43, but t80 isn't t43. Wait, maybe A is NT18, which can produce t74. Hmm, the second token is t65, so maybe that's a different path.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the string starts with t80, which is part of a longer production. But in the grammar, all productions are binary splits, so each step produces two symbols. So for the string to start with t80, there must be a production where one of the non-terminals produces t80 in a two-symbol step.\n\nWait, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and the first symbol is from NT32. Let's see what NT32 can produce. Looking at the grammar, NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT3. NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15, NT3 \u2192 NT1 NT74, etc. That's a longer path. Let's try to see if that can lead to t80.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32. NT18 produces t74. So the first symbol could be t74, which matches the second token in the string. Wait, no, the string starts with t80, so that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the string correctly. The string is:\n\nt80 t65 t1 t74 t43 t56 t70 t15 t63 t63 t84 t53 t56 t34 t21 t17 t82 t34 t52 t46 t12 t53 t84 t77 t40 t33 t28 t32 t3 t63 t35 t63 t32 t84 t65 t17 t56.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to find if any of the productions start with t80. Looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nLook for NT that has a production as 't80'. I see NT31 \u2192 't35', 't63', etc., but not t80. Hmm. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces t80? Scanning through the grammar, it seems none except through multi-step rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that each production of NT24 eventually ends up generating a string of terminals that corresponds to 't4 t1' or other such combinations.\n\nWait, but in the string provided, 't42' is present. Let me check if 't42' is a terminal in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I don't see an entry where a non-terminal directly produces 't42'.

{"custom_id":"request-728","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that it consists of several non-terminals (like S, NT32, NT14, etc.) and some terminals (like t53, t15, etc.). The string to be evaluated is a series of terminals separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the string must start with the expansion of S, which would produce two non-terminals: either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. Each of these non-terminals can further expand based on the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the other productions, most non-terminals seem to expand into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which looks like a recursive production generating strings with multiple NT3s. But since NT3 is another non-terminal, I need to see if it has a terminal production.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT3 is defined as producing 't1' or 't6' or 'something else? Let me check. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' (from NT7 \u2192 't1', but wait, NT3 is 't1'?) Wait, no, looking again, NT3 isn't directly defined. Let's parse all the rules.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me make a list.\n\nReading through the productions, I see a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example:\nNT3 \u2192 't1' (from NT7 \u2192 't1', but that's not NT3). Wait, no. Let me find where NT3 is defined. \n\nLooking through the list, I see NT31 and NT24 have productions that expand into other NTs, including 't71', 't9', etc., but I don't see NT3 being defined directly as a terminal or another non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me scan through again.\n\nWait, I don't see any production for NT3 except possibly as part of another NT's production. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which suggests NT3 is not a terminal because it's on the left side as a non-terminal. So maybe all the NT rules eventually break down into terminals.\n\nWait, looking further, I see NT39, but no, the last few rules include NT15, NT19, etc., but I don't see NT3. So perhaps I need to check if all the NTs eventually terminate into terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules. \n\nUpon reviewing, I notice that in the grammar, some NTs are defined as terminals directly. For example:\n- NT15 \u2192 't71' (also appears later)\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', but then there's also NT23 \u2192 't21', etc.\nWait, no, looking again, I see:\n- NT14 \u2192 't43', etc. Hmm, maybe the NTs are defined into terminals, but it's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree for the given string. Since the string is quite long, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a recursive structure that the grammar allows.\n\nThe given string is: t53 t15 t79 t56 t32 t21 t84 t43 t74 t75 t33 t26 t32 t53 t42 t65 t49 t56 t56 t21 t79 t63 t22 t26 t69 t52 t53 t6 t42 t33 t78 t40 t77 t80 t12 t59 t84 t1.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S which can expand into either:\n1. NT32 NT14\n2. NT18 NT32\n\nI need to see if the string starts with either of these two options. Let's check the first token in the string: t53.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT32 directly producing t53, because NT32 has multiple productions, like NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17, then NT24 can produce various NTs. Hmm, but in the string, after t53, it's t15, t79, etc. So perhaps the first part is building up some structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by expanding S into NT32 NT14, which would then each expand further. For example:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17\nThen NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 or other options\nBTW, let's see how NT24 is defined. It has several productions:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (again)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT17 NT30\n- NT24 \u2192 NT20 NT20\nHmm, so each of these would produce different combinations.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 has its own productions. From the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, that's another way to break down.\n\nThis seems quite complex, but maybe I can focus on specific parts of the string to see if they can be derived from certain productions.\n\nLooking deeper, I see 't53' appearing twice in the string. Let's see what NT32 is defined to produce. In the grammar, NT32 is defined as:\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17\nAnd NT24 has several options. For example, NT24 can produce NT4 NT1 or NT30 NT2, etc. Let me find where NT53 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT53 is defined by some NTs. Wait, in the production rules, I don't see any NTs directly expanding into 't53' except maybe in the later rules. Wait, let's check all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 nt21, etc., but not NT32 or any others. Wait, no. The terminal symbols include 't53', 't15', 't79', etc.\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any production of the form NTx \u2192 t53, so perhaps 't53' is generated by one of the non-terminals that eventually derive into it. But when is 't53' defined? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't actually see any NTs directly producing 't53' except perhaps in some recursive expansions, which is confusing because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. Oh no, the grammar as provided doesn't include any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't53' as a terminal. So if 't53' is in the string, it must be the result of a derivation where a non-terminal eventually expands into it. But given the grammar as provided, I need to see if any non-terminal can produce 't53'.\n\nLooking for 't53' in the productions, perhaps in some recursive step, a non-terminal might reduce to it. But looking through the entire list, I don't see any NT production that produces 't53' as a terminal. Hmm, that seems odd because the string does contain 't53'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through the entire grammar again to check for any production rule that directly defines 't53'. From the list of productions:\n\nLooking through NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't1'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34', 't21'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't9', 't7', etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any NT directly producing 't53'. So unless 't53' is produced through some chain of non-terminals, but the way the CFG is structured, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, and each non-terminal must eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Because in the given grammar, if 't53' is part of the string, but there's no rule where a non-terminal produces 't53', then it's impossible for the grammar to derive the string containing 't53'. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut that can't be right, because the string has 't53', yet in the grammar, there's no production for any non-terminal to 't53'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string provided is quite long, so I need a systematic way to check if it's possible to derive this string from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the initial productions from S are either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with tokens that can be derived from either of these.\n\nThe string begins with `t70 t33 t78 t71 t3 t70 t12 t84 t53 t63 t26 t68 t52 t82 t64 t33 t35 t35 t49 t40 t42 t82 t79 t34 t84 t74 t33 t12 t53 t74 t82 t21 t3 t77 t49 t42 t3 t72 t6`. Looking at the first few tokens: t70, t33, t78.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because from S, the first production is either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the first two tokens should be a pair derived from NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Let me check the possible pairs in the string.\n\nLooking for t70 first. I see that t70 is derived from NT31 in several ways, like NT31 -> NT6 NT33, etc. But starting with NT31, the next part would involve what? The first production for NT31 is NT6 NT33. So that would look like [t6 t33], but the string starts with t70 t33. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. I should approach this step by step. Let me try to parse the string backward because sometimes it's easier to see if the end tokens can be reduced.\n\nThe last token in the string is t6. Looking at the grammar, t6 can be derived from NT1, so NT1 -> 't7'. But wait, looking at the given grammar, t6 is derived from NT27: NT27 -> 't30'? No, wait, in the grammar, looking at the rules, t6 is derived from NT23: actually, let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, I need to parse this again. The grammar is extensive, but I'll look for the t6 token.\n\nIn the grammar, I see that NT27 -> NT17 NT1, but that doesn't directly lead to t6. Wait, looking more carefully, I see rules like NT23 -> 't34', but that's part of NT23 being rewritten. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nWait, from the given grammar, I notice that some non-terminals are rewritten into terminal symbols. For example, NT7 -> 't1'. So t1 is when NT7 is used. Similarly, NT13 -> 't28', NT2 -> 't28' and others. So perhaps I can find paths where certain non-terminals lead directly to terminals.\n\nThe last token is t6. Looking for rules that produce t6. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT6 -> NT18 NT27, but I don't see t6 directly. Wait, looking further, I see NT27 -> NT28 NT15, but that still doesn't lead to t6. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps t6 comes from a specific rule. For example, NT2 -> 't28' is one of the rules, but that isn't t6. Hmm. Wait, actually, looking again, I might have missed a rule where a non-terminal directly translates to t6.\n\nWait, let me scan the rules again:\n\nLooking for 't6' in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n- NT5 -> 't68'\n- NT6 doesn't seem to directly produce t6, but the production for NT2 is NT2 -> 't28'.\n- Wait, in the given rules, I see NT24 -> 't72' and other t's, but I'm not seeing a direct rule for t6.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the given rules again. Oh, wait, in the list of rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> NT17 NT10\n- NT17 -> NT68 and such.\n\nWait, perhaps t6 comes from NT23: looking at the rules, yes, NT23 can be rewritten into t34. Wait, no, I think I might be getting mixed up. Alternatively, maybe t6 is not present as a terminal in the grammar, which would mean the string has a token that's not possible, so the answer would be No. But I'm not sure, as I might have missed a rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try looking at each token and see if it can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nThe string starts with t70, which is derived from NT31. Looking at the rules for NT31:\n\nNT31 -> NT9 NT11, NT11 -> NT20 NT19, etc., but in the rules provided, I see several options for NT31:\n\n- NT31 -> NT6 NT33\n- NT31 -> NT24 NT21\n- NT31 -> NT23 NT11\n- NT31 -> NT25 -> something else, but in the provided rules:\n\nWait, looking more carefully, in the given grammar, the rules are extensive:\n\nI see:\n\nNT31 -> NT6 NT33\n\nWhich would mean that NT31 can be rewritten as NT6 and NT33, which could be terminal or non-terminal symbols. Then NT6, looking at the rules, is possibly a non-terminal that can be further broken down.\n\nBut to make progress, perhaps I should build a parse tree from the given string backward, trying to find reductions.\n\nAnother approach: Since the grammar is context-free, we can apply the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut given the size of the grammar (with over 100 non-terminals), CYK might be complex. Instead, perhaps I can try to find a path through the grammar that generates the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me see: The string is 52 tokens long, which seems manageable, but the exact breakdown is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for each token and see if it can be matched by any non-terminal.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the first token, t70, and see where it can come from.\n\nIn the grammar, t70 is from NT8 -> t46, but perhaps NT8 can be a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT8's rules, I don't see it directly producing t70. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm looking for tokens that correspond to specific non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the input string. Let me re-examine the string:\n\nt70 t33 t78 t71 t3 t70 t12 t84 t53 t63 t26 t68 t52 t82 t64 t33 t35 t35 t49 t40 t42 t82 t79 t34 t84 t74 t33 t12 t53 t74 t82 t21 t3 t77 t49 t42 t3 t72 t6.\n\nLooking at the tokens, I notice that t70 appears early on, and the next token is t33. Earlier, I thought that t70 is derived from NT31 as in NT31 -> NT6 NT33, so the t70 would correspond to t6?\n\nWait, perhaps t6 is a terminal that appears at a certain point in a production. Looking at the grammar:\n\nI see NT6 -> NT24 NT27, which is a production into non-terminals. So unless one of those non-terminals is a terminal, which they aren't, there's no way for t6 to appear. So perhaps the string has t6 where it shouldn't, making the answer No.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe t6 is a terminal somewhere else.\n\nWait, I notice that NT27 -> NT28 NT15, and in the given rules, NT28 can produce t82, t84, etc. But not t6.\n\nWait, looking again, I might have made a mistake in mapping the tokens to the non-terminals. For instance, NT1 -> 't6' is one of the rules, so"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the only start symbol is S. S has two productions: \n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nEach of NT's are non-terminals that eventually derive into sequences of terminals. So, the string must start with either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t21. Wait, but the start symbol S leads to NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, and NT's must be non-terminals. So, the first step is that the grammar's start symbol S will lead to two non-terminals, say A and B, which then must be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t21, which is a terminal. So, if the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first two tokens must be the results of NT32 and NT14. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT32 has various productions. From the list, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t1 (from NT7 \u2192 t40, but in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 t1. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT7 \u2192 t1. Wait, but in the list provided, I see NT7 \u2192 t1, yes.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t21. So, maybe the first part is NT32 \u2192 ... leading to t21.

Let me check all productions for NT32.\n\nAh, wait, in the grammar, NT24 has several productions. One of them is NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6. NT6 can go to NT24 NT27, and so on. Maybe it's too deep. Wait, perhaps I need to traverse the grammar tree to see how t21 is derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at how each non-terminal can become a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT21's productions: Wait, in the grammar, I see NT21's productions? Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT21 has several rules, but I don't see NT21 being on the left side. Looking again, I think I'm getting confused. Let me check for NT21's productions.\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', but that's for NT23 as a terminal, not NT21. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by considering that each non-terminal expands into one terminal and one non-terminal, and the non-terminals expand further until they all produce terminals.\n\nSo, the string must be built by starting at S and expanding step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven that the first part of the string is t21, perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and then one of the non-terminals NT18 or NT32 must expand to t21.\n\nLooking at the grammar, looking for where a non-terminal can expand directly to t21.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice that NT24 has a production NT24 \u2192 't72', but that's not t21.

So, that's a problem because the string starts with t21.

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing a bit easier, but since it's a context-free grammar, I can use some methods like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parser.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens: t35, t26, t63, t12, t25, t26, t63, t80, t75, t62, t65, t3, t52, t78, t77, t80, t33, t28, t3, t22, t65, t33, t77, t43, t49, t70, t78, t77, t35, t77, t62, t6, t43, t74, t78, t80, t56, t1, t3, t3.\n\nHmm, these are all 't' followed by numbers, so it looks like terminal symbols. The non-terminals are S, NT32, NT14, NT30, etc. So the problem is to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if I can decompose the string into the non-terminals as defined by the grammar. Since the grammar is CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two terminals or non-terminals, and each step increases the length of the string by one. So for a string of length n, the parse tree has n-1 productions.\n\nI'll try to break down the string step by step. Let's write down the string:\n\nt35, t26, t63, t12, t25, t26, t63, t80, t75, t62, t65, t3, t52, t78, t77, t80, t33, t28, t3, t22, t65, t33, t77, t43, t49, t70, t78, t77, t35, t77, t62, t6, t43, t74, t78, t80, t56, t1, t3, t3.\n\nThat's 39 tokens long.

{"custom_id":"request-763","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to correspond to a terminal symbol, possibly representing steps or productions in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I need to verify that it indeed follows CNF, but since the user provided that it's in CNF, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nThe string given is quite long and consists of tokens like \"t43\", \"t15\", etc. My first thought is that these tokens might represent the result of replacing non-terminals with terminals through a series of productions. Each step in the derivation would involve replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo approach this, I can model the process as parsing the string step by step, starting from the top-level non-terminal (S) and see if I can derive the given string. Alternatively, I can try to see if each step in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the string is a linear sequence of tokens, which might not directly map to the parse tree structure. Each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which themselves can be non-terminals that can be further expanded. So the process is a series of substitutions leading to a final string of terminals.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal can only expand into two non-terminals or one terminal. So each step would involve expanding a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nI think the approach is to try to apply the productions in reverse. That is, start from the given string and try to see if it can be reduced to S through reverse productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each step of the string as a possible node in the parse tree. But given how long the string is, manually constructing the parse tree seems impractical. I need a better strategy.\n\nPerhaps I can look for patterns or terminals that appear only on the left-hand side of a production. For example, if a token \"t70\" is a terminal, maybe there's a production where a non-terminal can be replaced by that token. Alternatively, if \"t70\" is on the left-hand side of a production, say X \u2192 t70 Y, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal is on the left-hand side with a terminal. All productions have non-terminals on the left and either non-terminals or terminals on the right.\n\nWait, in the grammar, most of the rules are from the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, except for a few where it's NTxxx \u2192 tsomething. For example, NT34 \u2192 t24, or NT28 \u2192 t82, etc.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to look for each token and see if it's on the right-hand side of a production. If the token is a terminal, it must have been produced by a production where the non-terminal on the left is replaced by this terminal.\n\nBut since the grammar defines each non-terminal's possible expansions as either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, maybe the process is to check if each token appears as a result of a production chain.\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of symbols and see if the derivation length makes sense. For a CFG in CNF, the maximum number of steps to generate a string of length n is 2n - 1, starting from S. Since S can produce two non-terminals, each of those can produce two each, etc., leading to exponential growth.\n\nThe given string has 44 tokens. So the length is 44. Using the formula, the minimum number of steps required is 2*44 - 1 = 87. So the string would have been generated after 87 steps. But without knowing the exact parse tree, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut since the problem is to just say Yes or No, maybe there's a shortcut. Perhaps some of the tokens can't be produced by any rules, indicating the string isn't possible.\n\nLooking at the tokens, for example, \"t1\" appears multiple times. Let's check if \"t1\" is in any production on the right-hand side. Scanning through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t1. So NT7 can produce \"t1\" and a non-terminal.\n\nAnother example: NT24 \u2192 t72. So t72 is possible. But t43, t15, etc., need to check if they appear in the productions.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, there are some rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT23 \u2192 t34\n- NT15 \u2192 t15 (Wait, no: looking back, the rules are often in forms like NT15 \u2192 t68 or similar. Let me recheck. The user provided a lot of rules, but I have to be careful.\n\nLooking more carefully, in the grammar:\n- \"NT15 \u2192 't71'\", \"NT15 \u2192 't35'\", \"NT15 \u2192 't21'\", etc. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, there's a production where NT15 can produce various terminals and combinations. For example, NT15 \u2192 t71, t35, t21, etc. But none of them directly produce \"t15\" as a terminal. So, \"t15\" isn't a direct terminal; it must be produced through some production.\n\nWait, but the user provided production rules where NT15 can be replaced by various combinations. For example, NT15 \u2192 't48', but in the list, it says NT15 \u2192 't68', 't19', 't30', etc. Wait, actually, I might have misread the rules, but perhaps t15 is only on the left of some productions.\n\nBut in the rules, I don't see NT15 directly as a terminal. So, t15 must be the result of some expansion of a non-terminal that eventually leads to it. For example, if NT15 \u2192 't59' (as per some rule), that would make t59 a terminal in the string. Similarly, in the given string, t15 appears multiple times.\n\nWait, but in the given string, we have t15, t19, etc. I need to see if these can be reached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains terminals that are not present in any production as a terminal, meaning the string isn't valid.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the string, I see \"t71\". Is t71 a terminal? In the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 t71, so yes, NT7 can be replaced by t71. So t71 is a possible terminal.\n\nSimilarly, \"t43\" appears in the string. In the grammar, looking for any rule where a non-terminal \u2192 t43. I see NT42 \u2192 t42, but where does t43 come from? Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t56\n- NT3 \u2192 t1\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT24 \u2192 t72\n- NT28 \u2192 t82\n- etc.\n\nDoes any rule have a terminal like t43? Let me scan all the provided rules for any 't43'.\n\nYes, looking back at the provided grammar:\n\n- \"NT4 \u2192 t56\"\n\nWait, but t43 isn't directly present. Looking through all the rules, I don't see any production that results in \"t43\". So, does that mean that \"t43\" is not a terminal that can be produced by the grammar? If so, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the provided rules again. Each rule is of the form \"NTx \u2192 RHS\". The RHS can be either NTy or a terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t56\n- Others don't have t43.\n\nSo, since the given string includes \"t43\", but according to the grammar, there's no production that produces t43 as a terminal, the string cannot be derived, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the token \"t43\", which cannot be produced by any production rule in the given grammar. Since the grammar does not have a rule to produce \"t43\" as a terminal symbol, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are defined by Chomsky normal form, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the productions fit this rule, so that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t65 t22 t77 t32 t33 t72 t46 t65 t17 t32 t49 t70 t82 t77 t19 t3 t62 t59 t33 t64 t77 t43 t33 t19 t33 t43 t80 t19 t33 t15 t62 t1 t32 t59 t84 t63 t71 t28 t56 t82 t43`.

However, the string has a lot of 't' tokens, which must correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking closer, I see some 't' productions attached to non-terminals. For example, NT15 can produce 't71' or 't35', and NT24 can produce 't72' or others. Each 't' token seems to be a specific terminal, but I'm not entirely sure how they map. It looks like each 't' is tied to a specific terminal symbol in the grammar, but I need to check which ones are present.\n\nWait, I see that the string includes 't65', 't22', 't77', etc. I need to find if these 't's can be derived from the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals like NT30, NT31, etc., have productions that eventually lead to 't's. For example, NT30 -> NT2 NT22, and NT2 -> several options that include NT0 and NT22, which further break down into 't's.\n\nHmm, so maybe the entire string is built up by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions into these NTs, and then each NT eventually produces a 't' or another NT that produces a 't'.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, S seems to only produce NT32 NT14 or NT30 NT2. Let me check:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT30 NT2\n\nSo, starting from S, it splits into two parts. Let's say if I expand S, I get two non-terminals that then produce the first 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t65, t22, t77, t32, t33, etc. So I need to see if each of these 't's can be derived from the NTs in the grammar.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by trying to trace the derivation path from S to the given string. Let's try to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by some NT production.\n\nBut the problem is that each NT might produce multiple options, and without knowing the exact mapping of 't's to NTs, it's hard to verify. Alternatively, maybe I can check if each token in the string is present in the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has a few explicit 't's attached to certain NTs, like NT7 -> t1, NT7 -> t40, etc. So each NT might have specific 't's as their productions.\n\nBut the string includes a lot of 't's that are not in the immediate productions. For example, t65 isn't directly a production of any NT I see. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NTs that produce these 't's through multiple steps. For example, if an NT can produce another NT which can eventually produce the 't', then it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is generated by a series of expansions where each production eventually leads to a 't'. But without knowing the exact grammar structure, it's tough.\n\nWait, let me try to see if any of the 't's in the string can be traced back. For instance, t65 is somewhere in the middle. Looking at the grammar, I see NT7 -> t1 and t40, but none directly produce t65. However, maybe NT23 can produce t65? Wait, in the grammar, NT23 has several productions, including NT23 -> t34. So maybe NT23 can eventually produce t34, but not t65.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck on trying to track each 't' individually. Maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be generated by some rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', 't19', 't33', etc. Similarly, NT23 can produce t34.\n\nBut in the string, there's a t65. Does any NT produce t65? Let's check the grammar for 't65' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT17 -> t68, NT7 -> t1, t22, etc. Hmm, no NT directly produces t65. So unless t65 is part of a production in the grammar beyond the given rules, it might not be possible to derive t65.\n\nWait, maybe I've missed it. Let me go through all the production rules to see if any NT produces 't65'.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't19', 't33', 't15', 't62', 't59', 't33', 't64', 't77', 't43', 't33', 't19', 't33', 't43', 't80', 't19', 't33', 't15', 't62', 't1', 't32', 't59', 't84', 't63', 't71', 't28', 't56', 't82', 't43'\n- NT2 -> several options, none ending with 't65'\n- NT1 -> t6\n- NT0 -> t40, t23, t28, etc.\n- NT7 -> t1, t40\n- NT23 -> t34\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing 't65'. So unless 't65' is a result of a more complex derivation, it might not be present. However, since the grammar is context-free, it can generate any string that can be built by the production rules.\n\nBut wait, the grammar might allow for 't65' to be derived from a chain of NTs. But from the rules, each NT either ends with a terminal or another NT. So, if 't65' is not directly produced by any NT, it might not be in the language.\n\nBut then again, maybe there's a path that produces a longer string that includes 't65'. However, considering the grammar, each production splits into non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually produces terminals. So, if 't65' is not an immediate production, it's possible it's not reachable unless another rule allows it.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about this differently. Maybe the string includes some 't's that are not covered by the grammar, making it impossible to generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or has too many unique 't's that aren't covered. But without knowing all possible 't's, it's hard to tell.\n\nWait, the user provided all the production rules, and some of the 't's are present, like t7, t40, etc. But is t65 among them? Let me recheck the rules:\n\nLooking at the productions, like NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't19', 't33', etc. I don't see 't65' being directly produced by any NT. So maybe t65 isn't part of the grammar's terminals, making the string not generateable.\n\nSince the string contains 't65', and the grammar doesn't seem to have any NT that can produce this, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check in case I missed something. Looking through all NT productions again, no, I don't see any NT leading to 't65'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-789","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is: `t53 t64 t32 t75 t21 t70 t26 t74 t65 t35 t40 t53 t56 t35 t6 t28 t75 t74 t46 t12 t6 t64 t80 t52 t52 t62 t1 t75 t75 t79 t43 t35 t59 t19 t74 t28 t43 t79 t1 t78 t43`.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that a grammar in CNF has productions of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, every production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, actually, wait\u2014the standard CNF is A -> BC, but for left-hand side, each side must consist of a single symbol, so each production is a single symbol (non-terminal on the left) expanding into exactly two non-terminals on the right. But wait, the productions can also have a single terminal on the right? Or does it have to be exactly two non-terminals? I think in CNF, the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal? Or wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A -> BC (two non-terminals) or A -> a (a single terminal). But sometimes, the definition allows the right-hand side to consist of a single symbol, which can be a terminal or a non-terminal. Hmm, but in that case, it's called CNF if all productions are of the form A->BC or A->a, so I think that's correct.\n\nGiven that, I can start analyzing the provided grammar and the string. The string consists of a series of 't' followed by varying numbers, like t53, t64, and so on. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive, so it might be easier to start from the top-level productions and see what kind of structures they can generate. The start symbol is S.\n\nS can produce two options:\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t53. Let me see if any non-terminals expand to t53. Scanning through the productions, I see that:\n\n- NT34 -> NT24 NT18 (but t24 would look up to see if it's a terminal)\n- NT35 is not present as a terminal, but looking further, I see NT35 is listed as a terminal under NT15: NT15 -> 't35'. Wait, no, let me look carefully. The grammar has several places where non-terminals are mapped to terminals. For example, NT7 -> 't1', etc. So, some of the non-terminals are terminals. \n\nI need to map each symbol in the string to see if they correspond to terminals in the grammar. The string has symbols like t53, t64, t32, etc. So I need to check each of these to see if they have a production that maps to them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have direct terminal mappings. For instance, NT3 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't1', NT17 -> 't68', etc. So, not all non-terminals are terminals; some are, others are not.\n\nWait, but I think in CNF, non-terminals cannot produce terminals directly if they are in a hierarchy. Or is that incorrect? Actually, no\u2014CNF allows for non-terminals to have a single terminal as their production. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So, that means a non-terminal can produce a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have productions that expand into a terminal, but more often, they expand into two other non-terminals. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have direct terminals for certain non-terminals, like NT17 -> 't68', NT28 -> 't82', etc. So, that's how the string can have single terminals.\n\nNow, looking at the first symbol in the string: t53. Let me check if there's any production that maps NT... to t53. Going through the grammar, I see NT19 -> 't1', NT23 -> 't34', NT29 -> 't28', NT6 -> 't53', etc. So, NT6 has a production that expands to t53. That's important because that means, somewhere in the derivation, NT6 will produce t53.\n\nSo, the first step is: the string starts with t53, which can only occur if there's a way to produce t53. Looking at the grammar, the only non-terminal that maps to t53 is NT6 -> 't53'. Therefore, this must come from a production where NT6 is the result.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT6 being expanded. Then, since NT6 is a non-terminal, it can be expanded in the grammar. Looking at the productions for NT6, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't18 NT27' (from the initial part)\n- NT6 -> 't24 NT12' (from further down)\n- NT6 -> 't78' (from the lower part)\n- NT6 -> 't9 NT17' (multiple entries)\n- And others, but the important ones are the ones leading to 't53' are these, but wait, I'm looking for NT6. Let me check:\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, NT6's productions include:\n\nNT6 -> 't18 NT27'\nNT6 -> 't24 NT12'\nNT6 --> 't24 NT18'\nNT6 --> 't78' [perhaps? Wait, looking back: 'NT6 -> 't78'' is an option. So, NT6 can also produce the terminal t78, which would correspond to t78 in the string. But the first symbol is t53, not t78. Therefore, NT6 must have another production that includes t53 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see NT6 directly mapping to t53. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that maps to t53.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 -> 't53'? Wait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe entry says, \"NT6 -> 't53'\". So, there is a production NT6 -> 't53'. That makes sense now. So, NT6 can either produce t53 or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me find all the NT6 productions:\n\nIn the grammar, I see entries like NT6 -> 't18 NT27' and NT6 -> 't24 NT12', but also NT6 -> 't53'? Yes, the first part of the grammar after NT30 mentions NT15 -> 't40', and later in the grammar, I see multiple NTx -> 't..' entries. Let's search for NT6:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n\"NT15 -> 't40'\")\n\"NT24 -> 't72'\", etc. Looking further down, I find:\n\n\"NT6 -> 't53'\"\n\nAh, so NT6 has a production that directly maps to 't53'. So, in the string, the first symbol is t53, which must come from NT6 -> 't53'. Therefore, the derivation must start with S -> NT14 NT32 or S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, but in this case, the first symbol is from NT6. So, let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol in the string is from a non-terminal that is part of one of the productions starting from S. So, S can produce NT14 and NT32, or NT18 and NT32. So, the first part of the string must be derived from one of these two possibilities.\n\nGiven that, if the first symbol is t53, which is produced by NT6, which is part of NT14 or NT32? So, T14: looking for NT14 in the grammar. I see several NT14 productions, such as NT14 -> 't43' and others. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconstruct the parse tree. Since the string is quite long, maybe it's better to see if each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar, and if the structure allows for the necessary expansions.\n\nBut given the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, alright, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have a terminal. But looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the productions for S are S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So both these productions produce two non-terminals, each of which expands further until we reach terminals.\n\nNow, the string we're evaluating consists only of terminal symbols, but actually, looking closely, most of them are 't' followed by numbers like t82, t63, etc. Wait a second, let me check the grammar again. I notice that some non-terminals (like NT32, NT14, etc.) have productions that eventually derive these terminals. For example, NT14 has a production to 't43', which is a terminal. So each NT production either goes to two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nOur task is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a bit complex, maybe I should try to parse the string using the grammar or see if it fits a certain structure. Alternatively, perhaps looking for the starting points would be helpful.\n\nWait, the string is a series of terminals (like t82, t63, etc.). In a Chomsky normal form grammar, the start symbol is S, and the derivations start from S. Given that S has two productions: NT32 NT14 and NT18 NT32. So each of these will lead to a sequence of non-terminals, which will further expand until they reach terminals.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the string. It starts with t82, then t63, t34, etc. So perhaps each of these corresponds to a derivation in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's more efficient to consider that each non-terminal has certain production paths. For instance, if I can map each token in the string to a terminal derived from a specific non-terminal, maybe by tracking how they could have been generated.\n\nWait, but given the complexity of the grammar, it might be time-consuming to trace the entire derivation. Maybe a better approach is to check whether the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is binary, so every non-terminal can generate two other non-terminals. The string length is 40 tokens, which is even, so maybe it's built from S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. Let's see:\n\nIf the string starts with t82, maybe NT32 could produce t82 via some production. Similarly, the second part of the first split (NT14) would need to produce the remaining tokens.\n\nBut I need to see if there's a path in the grammar that connects NT32 and NT14 to the rest of the string. Alternatively, let's try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be appropriate. However, given the size, it might not be practical without creating tables, so perhaps a better approach is to look for the start symbol and see if the entire string can be derived.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. The string is a sequence of 40 symbols. Let's check if the first two symbols in the string can be derived from NT32 and NT14.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t82. Let's look at NT32's productions. scrolling through the grammar, NT32 is mentioned in several productions, including NT14 -> t43, which is a terminal, but also others that go to NT14 and NT23, perhaps. Wait, I need to see NT32's productions. Wait, the user hasn't provided all the productions in the initial message, but re-reading, it may clarify that NT32 is a non-terminal, but perhaps looking for t82.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps mapping all the possible terminals that each non-terminal can derive. So for example, NT23 is involved in multiple productions, one of which is t34. So NT23->t34 is a terminal.\n\nBut it's time-consuming to list all possible terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can identify the start and end points. Let me see: the string starts with t82 and ends with t40. So if the string starts with t82, maybe it is derived from NT32 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but to make progress, perhaps I should look for the highest level productions. Let's see, S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's see:\n\nAssuming S -> NT32 NT14, then the string should start with the expansion of NT32, followed by the expansion of NT14.\n\nSimilarly, if S -> NT18 NT32, then the string starts with NT18's expansion and then NT32's.\n\nSo let's consider the first option: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string would split into two parts: the first part is derived from NT32, and the second from NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t82, which could be the result of NT32. So perhaps the first part of the string (t82, t63, t34, etc.) is derived from NT32, and the second part is derived from NT14.\n\nSimilarly, NT14's productions can be checked. From the grammar, NT14 -> NT53, but wait, the grammar doesn't have NT53. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at an incomplete part. Let me check again:\n\nNo, perhaps I misread. Looking again, the user provided a list of grammar productions, but not in an ordered way. For example, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT14 -> t43 (is that correct?) No, let me scan through the productions:\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, in the initial list, I can see NT14 -> t43? Let me check: No, actually, looking through the list, I don't see NT14 -> t43. Instead, NT14 is part of NT23's production, e.g., NT23->t34. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at an older version.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, the productions for NT14 are:\n\nLooking back, I see lines like:\n\nNT15 -> t71\n\nNT15 -> t35\n\nWait, no, that's for NT15.\n\nWait, I'm perhaps getting confused because the grammar is extensive and hard to parse. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and whether the sequence of non-terminals leads back to S.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps instead of trying to parse the entire string, I can check if the entire string's structure aligns with the possible derivations.\n\nAnother thought: since each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, the entire string length should be (2^n) for some n, but 40 isn't a power of two. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, 40 is 2*20, which is possible if one split.\n\nBut, in a Chomsky normal form, the length of the string can be any size that allows for binary expansions, so perhaps that's not an issue.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact structure, maybe I need to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm steps. But given that it's 40 tokens, that's a lot, but perhaps I can look for the start symbol and see if each split aligns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that the grammar has a limited number of non-terminals, but some non-terminals can expand into many terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, many non-terminals produce terminals and other non-terminals. So each non-terminal has several production options.\n\nPerhaps another approach is to use the fact that in CNF, the number of symbols in the string must have a certain structure. For example, if the string can be divided in a way that each split corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since this is taking time, perhaps I should give a tentative conclusion.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are parsed using methods like the CYK algorithm, which works by analyzing the string in passes according to the grammar's rules. But since I'm not too familiar with CYK, maybe I can approach this by seeing if each token in the string can be derived from the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of tokens separated by spaces. The string is: \n\nt33 t32 t42 t64 t64 t78 t52 t33 t46 t42 t35 t78 t42 t1 t77 t3 t25 t71 t56 t56 t1 t33 t40 t42 t62 t26 t78 t75 t40 t53 t49 t80 t26 t19 t56 t40 t28 t6 t74 t70 t15 t69\n\nI also notice that some of the rules in the grammar produce 't' followed by numbers, like 't1', 't3', up to 't79'. Some of these 't' tokens might be terminal symbols, but others are part of the non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking closer, the 't' tokens are actually the only terminals in the grammar, because the rest are all non-terminals with 'N' prefixes. So each 't' is a terminal, and each 'N' is a non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the grammar seems to have more 't' tokens than I expected. The last line of the grammar shows things like 't7', 't19', etc. So each production that ends with 'tX' would produce a terminal token. \n\nNow, let me try to map the string tokens to the grammar rules. Each 't' token in the string must correspond to a production rule that ends with that 't'. For example, looking at the last part of the grammar: NT0 -> 't40', 't71', 't59', 't33', etc.\n\nSo, I need to find a way to reduce the string step by step using the grammar. Since the string is quite long, this could be complex, but perhaps I can start by looking for the longest possible rules first.\n\nLet me list out all the 't' tokens in the string:\n\nt33, t32, t42, t64, t64, t78, t52, t33, t46, t42, t35, t78, t42, t1, t77, t3, t25, t71, t56, t56, t1, t33, t40, t42, t62, t26, t78, t75, t40, t53, t49, t80, t26, t19, t56, t40, t28, t6, t74, t70, t15, t69.\n\nWait, wait\u2014no, looking back, the string is:\n\nt33 t32 t42 t64 t64 t78 t52 t33 t46 t42 t35 t78 t42 t1 t77 t3 t25 t71 t56 t56 t1 t33 t40 t42 t62 t26 t78 t75 t40 t53 t49 t80 t26 t19 t56 t40 t28 t6 t74 t70 t15 t69.\n\nSo each of these is a separate token in the string. The first token is t33, then t32, etc.\n\nNow, to check if this string can be derived from S, we need to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production rule starting from S.\n\nBut this is going to be complex because the string is quite long and the grammar is extensive. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if any part of the string can be broken down into subparts that match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let me start by trying to find the longest possible match in the string from the start.\n\nThe first token is t33. Looking at the grammar, NT33 has the following productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT31 -> NT36 NT22 (Wait, no, looking again, maybe I misread.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of productions. Some of them are terminal symbols, like 't6', 't26', etc. My string is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe string is: `t6 t26 t53 t53 t17 t64 t22 t62 t25 t46 t12 t19 t77 t42 t49 t63 t65 t1 t70 t6 t32 t63 t64 t68 t70 t59 t32 t25 t32 t49 t17 t56 t17 t75 t35 t3 t12 t19 t15 t1 t64 t42 t80`.\n\nFirst, I should list out the productions to see the possible non-terminals.

Hmm, neither starts with 't6', but maybe 't6' comes from a production that includes 't6' earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the first few symbols. The first symbol is 't6'. Let's see if any NT can produce 't6'. For example, looking for production NT24 \u2192 't72' isn't 't6'. NT5 \u2192 't27' (from NT5 -> NT19 NT20) but it produces terminals, maybe. Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT6 \u2192 't27' \u2014 no, NT6's productions are NT24 NT12, not a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal corresponds to a production step. So the grammar can be applied in reverse, decomposing the string into symbols. But the string is in the order of application, so applying the grammar step by step to see if we can derive the string.\n\nAn alternative approach is to look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT30 NT14, S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the first step must produce two non-terminals. But the string starts with 't6', which is a terminal. So the parse tree for the string must come from those initial productions, and from there, eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, let's see the initial productions: S can derive either NT30 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the string's first two symbols must be a result of these initial steps. But the string starts with 't6' which is the first symbol, so perhaps the first NT (NT30 or NT18) produces 't6' through a series of steps.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, looking into non-terminals that can eventually produce a terminal. For example, looking for a path from NT30 or NT18 to 't6'.\n\nLet me pick NT30. The production for NT30 is NT3 NT30. So NT30 can produce a terminal or another NT30. Wait, no, NT3's production is NT7 NT3, and then NT7 \u2192 't1', NT3 \u2192 't1'. So maybe NT30 can produce a 't1' through a series of NT3s and NT7s.\n\nLooking, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. So how does this resolve to a terminal? It seems recursive, unless it's combined with another production. Wait, but in the grammar, NT30 can only produce NT3s, so unless there's a way for NT3 to produce a terminal, which I think it does. Let me think: NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT3, and NT7 can produce 't1'. So that would give 't1 t1', etc.\n\nWait, but then NT30 would be NT3 NT30, which could become something like 't1 t1 ... ', but perhaps when combined with another part, like from the initial S \u2192 NT30 NT14, then NT14 might produce another terminal. Let's check NT14. Oh, looking back, I don't remember seeing NT14 in the given productions, except the very last line: NT14 -> 't43'. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nAt the end, looking for NT14, the last line is NT14 -> 't43'. So NT14 directly produces 't43'. Okay.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT30 NT14 could, in the first step, produce NT30 and 't43'. Then, NT30 would have to produce a terminal, but it's producing NT3 NT30, which is recursive. So maybe there's a way for NT30 to produce a terminal beyond that.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully. NT30 can produce NT3 NT30, which is a single production. So NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. Then, in the next step, the right-hand side (NT3) can be expanded further. NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT3. NT7 \u2192 't1'. So each NT3 contributes 't1', while the NT30 part would keep expanding, leading to an infinite recursion unless another path exists.\n\nSo for the string to start with 't6', we have to see if the initial NT (either NT30 or NT18) can produce 't6' or lead to a production that ends in 't6'. Let's check the other initial option: S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the first symbol would have to come from NT18.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: NT18 \u2192 NT22 NT7, NT25 NT32, etc. Wait, I should check all productions for NT18. But from the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT18's productions are not listed as main ones. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through all the NT productions to see if any include 't6' and can start the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's re-examine the grammar. Oh, I see NT12: NT12 \u2192 NT78, but looking again:\n\nHere's the list:\n\nS \u2192 NT30 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n... and so on.\n\nLooking for NT that can directly produce 't6'. For example, perhaps NT24 \u2192 't72', but that's not 't6'. Wait, the last lines include NT6: Is there any NT6? Let me look.\n\nIn the given grammar, NT6 has production NT24 NT12. So it's not a terminal, but a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The initial productions for NT18? Let me check again. The grammar for NT18 is:\n\nI think NT18 has several productions like NT22 NT7, NT25 NT32, etc. Wait, perhaps I should list them:\n\nLooking for all NT18 productions: According to the provided grammar, I can find NT18:\n\nAfter S, we have:\n\nLooking through the list, I think NT18 has a production NT32 NT22, but that's a non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I didn't see that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm focusing on the wrong NT. Let me look for symbols in the string that might appear in the grammar's terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't6'. Let me find all NTs that can produce 't6' ultimately. To do that, I look for NTs with a production that includes 't6'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the only NT that directly produces 't6' is... Wait, in the given grammar, the last line is:\n\nNT14 -> 't43'\n\nAnd earlier, I don't see any NT directly producing 't6'. Unless... Maybe I'm missing an NT that can produce 't6' through a chain.\n\nLooking up the list of NTs that can produce 't6' through steps:\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps NT7 \u2192 't1', NT1 \u2192 't6', which is part of the rule NT15 perhaps? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, NT15 has rules: NT15 has two rules: NT27 NT30 and NT21 NT30 and is also a terminal? Looking at the provided grammar lines, I see:\n\nAt one point, I see:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT15 -> 't35'\nThat's it. So NT15 can directly produce 't71' and 't35'.\n\nLooking further, NT27 is a non-terminal, with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-824","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) use production rules to generate strings. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because CNF has a specific structure that might make parsing easier.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the rules are of the form NT<num> -> NT<num1> NT<num2>. For example, S -> NT32 NT14, and NT30 -> NT3 NT30. Oh, and some terminals are present, like 't75', which probably appears in the strings generated by the grammar.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t33 t64 t25 t75 t33 t17 t64 t78 t64 t26 t75 t65 t46 t74 t69 t21 t53 t1 t72 t33 t28 t70 t22 t22 t34 t52 t34 t3 t28 t63 t75 t22 t69 t46 t12 t32 t1 t21 t63 t59 t34 t64 t82`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which must correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar. Each production that ends with a terminal symbol is a terminal production, so every production rule like NT3 -> 't1' is terminal.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string step by step according to the grammar's production rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, it uses a leftmost derivation, meaning we start expanding from the leftmost non-terminal (S in this case).\n\nLet me start by looking at the initial symbols. The string begins with 't33'. So, I need to find a production rule for the non-terminal that generates 't33'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT33 might be a non-terminal. Wait, let me check: in the rules provided, I see lines like NT33 -> 't52', and NT23 -> 't70'. Hmm, but do I see a rule for 't33'?\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar rules for any terminal symbols. I see entries like NT19 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't40', NT23 -> 't34', and so on. But for 't33', I don't immediately see a production rule. Let me check again: looking through the list, I find that NT33 -> 't52', which is a terminal. But I don't see a rule that produces 't33' as a terminal. So that might be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe 't33' is produced by some non-terminal that has a production rule ending with 't33'. Let me check the grammar again. Looking through the rules, I see NT13 -> 't28', NT24 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't68', etc. But where is 't33' coming from? Let me see if any non-terminal's production has 't33' as the last symbol.\n\nLooking through the list again, I see NT15 -> 't33'? No, actually, I see NT15 -> 't35' and NT15 -> 't21', and another production for NT23 -> 't34'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps 't33' is generated by another non-terminal that I haven't considered. Let me check each rule again:\n\nLooking through all rules, the only terminal symbols I see are in the last part. For example, NT15 -> 't35', NT19 -> 't1', NT23 -> 't34', NT19 -> 't15' (wait, no), wait, I think I might have misread. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT19 -> 't1'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT32 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't49'\n- NT12 -> 't78'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't49'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT2 -> 't49'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT17 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't74'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT24 -> 't12'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT30 -> 't63'\n- NT27 -> 't77'\n- NT33 -> 't52'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT25 -> 't64'\n- NT24 -> 't17'\n- NT17 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't46'\n- NT0 -> 't32'\n- NT24 -> 't79'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT31 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT1 -> 't6'\n- NT0 -> 't84'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't80'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I think I missed that NT13 -> 't33'. Yes, here: NT13 -> 't33'. So, 't33' is generated by NT13. Okay, that solves that part. So the first symbol 't33' comes from NT13. So, S starts as NT32 NT14. Let's proceed.\n\nWait, no, the start symbol is S, which is NT32 NT14. So our initial string is: t33 t64 t25 t75 t33 t17 t64 t78 t64 t26 t75 t65 t46 t74 t69 t21 t53 t1 t72 t33 t28 t70 t22 t22 t34 t52 t34 t3 t28 t63 t75 t22 t69 t46 t12 t32 t1 t21 t63 t59 t34 t64 t82.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the start symbol S is rewritten to NT32 NT14. So the first step is S -> NT32 NT14. So the first output is whatever NT32 expands to, then NT14. But in our string, the first symbol is 't33', which is part of NT13, not NT32 or NT14. So that might be a problem because NT32 expands to something else, like NT2 NT22, or other rules.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In a leftmost derivation, we start with S and replace the leftmost non-terminal according to production rules. So the initial production is S -> NT32 NT14, so we have NT32 NT14 as the current string. But the given string starts with 't33', which is part of NT13. So that indicates that perhaps the first two symbols should be from NT32 and NT14, but they're not; instead, the first symbols come from different non-terminals. So that would mean that the given string doesn't start with symbols directly derived from S's initial production.\n\nWait, that can't be right. So perhaps the given string doesn't start with the result of S's initial expansion, which would require NT32 and NT14 to expand into some sequence that starts with 't33' and so on. But in the string, it starts with 't33' and then goes to 't64', etc. So perhaps this suggests that the initial string starts with a production from a non-terminal that is part of the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should parse the string step by step, starting with S, and see if the symbols can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me try to outline the parsing process.\n\n1. Start with S -> NT32 NT14.\n\n   The generated string starts with NT32 NT14, which expands to something.

{"custom_id":"request-843","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar consists of several productions, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' tokens with numbers. Hmm, wait a second\u2014each production in the grammar seems to produce a terminal symbol, specifically one that starts with 't' like 't79', 't42', etc. So, the string provided is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this case, looking at the grammar, each S and NT production seems to only produce two non-terminals except for some that produce terminals like 't3', 't7', etc. Wait, no, I think every production here is either two non-terminals or one terminal, which fits CNF. So that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. The question is whether there's a derivation path in the grammar that builds this string. Each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. Since it's CNF, each production has only two symbols on the right-hand side, so the parse tree for the string must have a leftmost derivation where each internal node has exactly two children.\n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence. That usually involves building a parse tree or using a method like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is quite large and the string is long, that might take too much time manually. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals, and ensure that the structure matches.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components:\n\nt79 t42 t28 t52 t65 t35 t3 t70 t80 t74 t82 t84 t68 t33 t78 t3 t71 t21 t63 t71 t6 t49 t65 t35 t26 t52 t68 t26 t71 t79 t63 t70 t3 t42 t42 t35 t17 t17 t34 t22 t25 t84 t65 t70.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the string, I see 't65 t70', and the grammar doesn't have a production for S \u2192 t65 t70. Wait, the grammar's start symbol is S, and the productions for S are:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, any valid string must derive from either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the string must start with either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. But looking at the string, it starts with t79, which is a terminal, but the initial production of S is non-terminal. So how can the string start with a terminal? That's a red flag.\n\nWait, let me check: the string starts with t79. But the initial productions of S are NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Since NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals, their productions must be expanded further until terminals appear. But if the string starts with a terminal, t79, that must mean that one of the NT's in the initial expansion directly produces t79. So let me check the productions for NT32 and NT14.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75 (from S \u2192 NT32 NT14)\nWait, no\u2014looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT32 NT32? No, let me look again.\n\nI need to scan all the productions for NT32. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n3. Then a bunch of NT30, NT4, etc. productions.\n4. Finally, looking for NT32: Hmm, towards the end of the list:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nLine 113: NT32 \u2192 t75\nLine 114: NT32 \u2192 t42\nLine 115: NT32 \u2192 t12\nLine 116: NT32 \u2192 t75\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some in between. Let me check each NT32 production:\n\nNo, actually, going through all the productions, I notice that NT32 has several productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75 (line 113)\nNT32 \u2192 t42 (line 114)\nNT32 \u2192 t12 (line 115)\nNT32 \u2192 t75 (line 116)\n\nHmm, okay, so NT32 can directly produce t75, t42, t12. Also, perhaps I should check other NT32 productions further down.\n\nWait, I notice that towards the end, there's NT32 \u2192 t75 t71 t63 t70. Wait, no, looking closer:\n\nLooking through the lines, I see:\n\nIn line 113: NT32 \u2192 t75\nThen line 65: NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22, which I think I misread earlier.\nWait, perhaps I should look more carefully. Let me list all the NT32 productions if I can find them.\n\nContinuing through the list:\n\n...\nLooking further down, line 146: NT23 \u2192 't34'\nNo, that's NT23. Wait, let me find all NT32 productions:\n\n- Line 113: NT32 \u2192 t75\n- Line 114: NT32 \u2192 t42\n- Line 115: NT32 \u2192 t12\n- Line 116: NT32 \u2192 t75\n\nWait, that's only four lines where NT32 goes to terminals. Are there more? Let me check each line systematically:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any other NT32 productions except these four. So NT32 can directly produce t75, t42, t12, or t75 again.\n\nSimilarly, for NT14: Do we have any production for NT14?\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t43 (line 131)\n\nSo NT14 can directly produce t43.\n\nSo, looking back at the initial productions, S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nIf the string starts with t79, that would imply that NT32 must directly produce t79, but looking at my earlier list, NT32 doesn't have a production that results in t79. So that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NT32 productions:\n\n- Line 113: NT32 \u2192 t75\n- Line 114: NT32 \u2192 t42\n- Line 115: NT32 \u2192 t12\n- Line 116: NT32 \u2192 t75\n\nNo, those are the only ones I see. So, unless I missed something, NT32 can only produce t75, t42, or t12 as terminals. Therefore, for the string to start with t79, it would require that after some expansion, a non-terminal produces t79. But in the given grammar, no NT production produces t79.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the NT productions for all NTs that might lead to t79. Specifically, is there any NT that directly has t79 as a production?\n\nLooking through the list, NT24 has:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t12 (line 115)\n...\nLine 48: NT24 \u2192 t72\n...\nLine 94: NT25 \u2192 t64\n...\nLine 130: NT26 \u2192 t52\n...\nLine 131: NT26 \u2192 t52\n\nNo, nothing is directly t79.\n\nWait, but looking for 't79' in all productions, perhaps it's not present.\n\nSo, if the first symbol in the string is t79, it must be produced by some NT. Since there's no NT in the grammar that directly produces t79, that would mean it's impossible for the string to start with t79. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I missed any NT32 productions that generate t79. Hmm, I don't see t79 in any of the NT32 productions. Similarly, other NTs may produce t79 if any.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT23: line"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-844","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't59', 't71', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in CNF, the derivation process is straightforward: each step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. Each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals eventually lead into terminal symbols, like 't1', 't3', etc.\n\nThe string given has 41 symbols, which is quite long. I think the best approach is to try to parse the string from the start symbol 'S' and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the string, I can see that the first few tokens are 't59', 't75', 't26', etc. I'll need to find a path in the grammar that can produce this sequence. Since the string starts with 't59', I should check if any production starts with 't59'. Looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT23 -> 't34', NT0 -> 't40', and others, but I don't see 't59' as a direct terminal. Instead, non-terminals like NT0, NT23, etc., produce 't59' sometimes.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see NT23 -> 't34' and NT15 -> 't40'. But 't59' appears in some productions, like NT31 -> 't69', and NT23 -> 't70'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I need to look for non-terminals that can produce 't59'.\n\nLooking through the rules again, I notice that NT0 -> 't40', and that NT31 -> 't69', but not 't59'. Hmm, maybe I need to look at higher-level rules. Is there a non-terminal that expands into 't59'? Yes, I see NT0 -> 't43' and NT31 -> 't69', but not 't59'. Wait, looking back, I see some rules like NT23 -> 't19' and NT22 -> 't3', but I'm not sure if these help.\n\nWait, another approach: the string starts with 't59', which suggests that one part of the derivation starts with 't59'. Since the grammar uses Chomsky Normal Form, the starting symbol S splits into two non-terminals, and each of those splits into two more, and so on, until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps starting with S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nLet me see: 't59' is the first symbol. So, perhaps the leftmost non-terminal (either NT32 or NT18) is involved in producing 't59'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT32, I see that NT32 appears in several rules, including NT32 -> NT24 NT4 and NT32 -> 't75' directly? Wait, no, in the grammar, I only see rules that NT32 is on the left. Let me check again. Wait, I see in the grammar: NT24 -> 't24' sometimes, but looking for 't59', I don't see it in NT32's rules.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, unless it's a terminal. But 't59' is a terminal, so it must appear as the result of a production that directly outputs 't59'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT31 -> 't69', NT23 -> 't34', etc., but I don't see a production that outputs 't59' directly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me see the rules again. scrolling through, I see NT23 -> 't34', NT0 -> 't40', NT19 -> 't1', etc. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check if any production leads to 't59'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the start symbol S might not be the only one, but looking at the rules, S is the only start symbol. So the entire string has to be a derivation from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to reconstruct the string step by step. Since the string is quite long, maybe each non-terminal in the grammar leads to a few terminals, so perhaps the string is a sequence of these.\n\nBut this approach might take forever. An alternative idea is to see if the string can be split into parts that fit the grammar structure. Since the grammar is CNF, each production step replaces a symbol with two others, and the entire string is built from the top down.\n\nWait, but the string is a linear sequence of terminals. So, in the derivation, the entire string must be a result of expanding the start symbol into a sequence of non-terminals, which then get replaced by more non-terminals until we're left with only terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into segments that match pairs of non-terminals, each of which is a production rule in the grammar.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is to look at the number of symbols. The string is 41 symbols long. Since each production step replaces a non-terminal with two, starting from S (1 symbol), each step increases the length by 1 (from 1 to 2, then 3, etc.). But since the string has 41 symbols, and each step adds one, that would require 40 production steps, but that's only if every production is of length 1. But in this case, the grammar's productions can vary.\n\nWait, maybe the total number of symbols should be equal to 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of production steps. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a top-down parsing approach, trying to match the string from the start symbol, using the production rules.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient, but implementing that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So, the derivation of the string will consist of a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and each has exactly two children, which are either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string in question is a linear sequence of terminals, so the parse tree must be a binary tree where each non-terminal node is expanded into two other nodes (either terminals or non-terminals), and the order of the string follows the left-to-right expansion of the parse tree.\n\nGiven the string is 41 symbols long, perhaps it's a balanced tree, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol is from the leftmost non-terminal. So, starting with S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nThe first symbol is 't59', so if it's the result of NT32, then I need to find a production for NT32 that leads to 't59'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT32 as a terminal. The productions for NT32 are:\n\nNT32 -> NT24 NT16\nNT32 -> NT26 NT17\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT32 appears in several rules, but I don't see NT32 being a terminal. So, perhaps NT32 must derive into a sequence that eventually leads to 't59' through other rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol 't59' comes from NT0, which has a production leading to 't59' in some rules.\n\nLooking again: I see NT0 -> 't43', NT0 -> 't71', and some others, but not 't59'. Wait, checking the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't71' and NT0 -> 't43', but no 't59'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong non-terminals. Let's see if 't59' can be generated by any non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals lead directly to 't59':\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT23 -> 't34' (not),\nNT0 -> 't43', 't71' (no),\nNT29 -> 't28', 't24' (no),\nNT31 -> 't69', 't70' (no),\nNT24 -> 't75', etc., but wait, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't59' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-868","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty complex with a bunch of productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol is S, and all other productions start with a single uppercase letter. The string provided starts with 't3', which suggests that each 't' is followed by a digit, indicating a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the terminals are the ones starting with 't', like 't3', 't21', 't23', up to 't91'. The other symbols (NT1, NT2, etc.) are non-terminals. The start symbol S produces NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, meaning that any derivation will start with these combinations and eventually produce a string of terminals.\n\nThe string is: t3 t34 t79 t84 t21 t26 t63 t53 t80 t69 t71 t72 t28 t22 t34 t59 t64 t34 t35 t74 t3 t15 t35 t68 t84 t68 t35 t79 t53 t40 t22 t64 t35 t49 t62 t74 t43 t26 t1 t21 t80 t42 t26 t12 t79.\n\nI notice that the string alternates between terminals and potentially non-terminals, but actually, wait no\u2014each element is a terminal, because each is 't' followed by a number. So for example, t3 is a terminal, t34 is another terminal, etc.\n\nWait, but the grammar's terminals are the t-... symbols, meaning each 't' followed by letters and digits, but in this case, the string is all 't' followed by numbers without any letters, except for t35 which has '35' but also '5' isn't a letter. So, perhaps the only non-terminals are the NTs, which have letters, while terminals are 't' followed by digits.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it through the productions.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to see if the string can be parsed using the given productions.\n\nBut considering the sheer number of productions and the string length (49 symbols), it's impractical to do a full parsing step-by-step. Instead, perhaps I can find patterns or specific productions that match parts of the string.\n\nWait, each production either goes to two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar is such that each symbol on the RHS must be either a terminal or a non-terminal that can produce terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, all the symbols after 't' are single digits or multiple digits, which would have to be terminals if they match one of the productions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the terminals are like 't3', 't7', 't1', etc., but also there's 't40', 't43', etc. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, so for example, 't3' is a terminal, as is 't34'.\n\nBut looking at the productions, many of the NTs produce sequences of terminals or other NTs. So, perhaps the key is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the productions.\n\nBut let's look for specific examples in the string to see if they match any RHS of productions. For instance, the first token is 't3'. Looking through the grammar, do any productions directly produce 't3'? Alternatively, does any NT production lead to 't3' through other productions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that correspond to S's productions. For example, S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So if the string starts with NT32 NT14, each of these would need to be expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, NT32 is a non-terminal. Looking at the productions, NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT28 NT21 and another NT32 -> t75. So 't75' is a terminal. So if a derivation starts with NT32, it can either be followed by NT28 NT21 or directly as t75.\n\nSimilarly, NT30 has a production NT30 -> NT2 NT22, and another NT30 -> NT26, which is a terminal (since NT26 isn't defined as a non-terminal but wait\u2014the productions for NT26 aren't listed; perhaps NT26 is a terminal or maybe I'm miscounting. Wait, looking back, NT26 is a non-terminal\u2014wait, checking:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT26 is a production? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT26->something or is it a terminal? Wait, in the list, the productions for NT are in the NT24 -> NT27 NT10, NT10 -> NT22 NT5, etc. Hmm, I don't see NT26 directly as a production. Wait, perhaps NT26 is a terminal because it's at the end of a production. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: terminal symbols are those that are on the RHS of productions when the LHS is a non-terminal and the RHS is a single terminal. So any symbol that isn't an uppercase letter, or perhaps any production where the non-terminal expands into a terminal sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that in this grammar, the terminals are all starting with 't', like 't3', 't7', etc., whereas non-terminals are uppercase letters like NT32, NT14, etc. So each production is an uppercase letter (non-terminal) on the left, and on the right, either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string provided consists of terminal symbols because each element is 't' followed by letters or digits, but since all terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by numbers or letters, but without any letters\u2014wait, no. For example, 't35' is a terminal because NT35 is a non-terminal, but wait, actually in the grammar, NT35 is a non-terminal, so 't35' would only be a terminal if NT35 directly produces it, which I don't think is the case. So perhaps 't35' is a terminal because it's in one of the productions as the RHS when a non-terminal expands to it.\n\nWait, for instance, looking at the productions, I don't see any NT35 defined yet. Wait, perhaps NT35 is a non-terminal, as we can see from the production NT30 -> NT26 NT18, etc. Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that any substring that's a terminal must match exactly one of the RHS options in the productions. But without a comprehensive list of all possible terminals, it's difficult. So, perhaps the best approach is to look for sub-strings in the string that match any rule in the grammar, breaking them down recursively.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps checking for specific parts can help. For example, if the string starts with 't3', is that a terminal? If so, is there any production where a non-terminal can produce 't3'? Let's check the productions for the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example, NT3->t1, which is a terminal. NT7->t1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a list of all terminals as per the grammar. The terminals are the 't' followed by certain numbers or letters.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals are all the 't's followed by numbers that are leaves in the production tree. For example:\n\nLooking at the productions, every time a non-terminal expands, it can either do so via two non-terminals or one terminal. So, the terminals are the strings that are on the RHS when a non-terminal expands into a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, for each non-terminal, if it has a production that is a single terminal, then that terminal is part of the language.\n\nFor example, looking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32: So if NT32 can expand to a single terminal, that's part of the language.\n\nNT30 -> NT2 NT32: Not helpful for a terminal.\n\nNT3->t1: So NT3 can produce 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7->t1.\n\nLooking at the entire list, I can see that NT30 -> NT2 NT32, but wait, perhaps more than one non-terminal can expand to a single terminal. Wait, I see some NTs having productions that end with a single 't' followed by a digit or letters.\n\nFor example, NT91->t1. So any 't1'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and productions, and the string is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky normal form (CNF) means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions fit this model, except for the terminals like 't71', 't35', etc., which are treated as terminals in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t75, t43, t56, and so on. My goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar's productions.\n\nThe first step is to look at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, whatever string is generated must start with either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nBut in the string, the first element is t75, which corresponds to NT15 producing t75 (as seen in the grammar under NT15 \u2192 't71' etc., but also look at NT7 \u2192 't1' and NT2 \u2192 't28'\u2014wait, that's under NT7: \"NT7 -> 't1'\", \"NT2 -> 't28'\", and \"NT14 -> 't43'\". Let me cross-check.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has two NT15 productions: one to 't68' and another to 't43'. Also, NT14 is already given as producing t43 (under \"NT14 -> 't43'\", but also looking at the NT32 production: NT32 can be derived from NT5, which branches into 't68' or 't49', etc. Maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to see if each \"t\" can be matched by the grammar's terminals. Each production either starts with a non-terminal or directly produces a terminal. Since the string is linear, we need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence through a series of left or rightmost derivations.\n\nLet me list the string elements: t75, t43, t56, t26, t74, t42, t1, t68, t28, t12, t32, t1, t25, t33, t17, t6, t17, t80, t63, t52, t72, t84, t46, t75, t59, t63, t19, t69, t42, t40, t78, t1, t84, t1, t65, t34, t62, t69, t49, t64, t64, t53, t12, t12, t1.\n\nThis is a long string, so parsing it might be time-consuming. Instead, let's consider the structure of the grammar and the possible ways to derive the string.\n\nThe string starts with t75. Looking at the grammar, NT15 can produce t71 and other t-s, but t75 isn't directly listed. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30 (useful for left recursion, but in this case, it might be rewritten as NT30 NT30... which isn't helpful for a single t63 later.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first element is t75, which comes from NT15, as seen in \"NT15 -> t71\", \"NT15 -> t35\", \"NT23 -> t34\", and others. Wait, no, in the grammar provided, under NT15, there are productions to t68, t43, etc. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 has two t productions:\n1. NT15 \u2192 't68'\n2. NT15 \u2192 't43'\nAdditionally, there's \"NT5 -> 't68'\", which is another non-terminal, not NT15.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, under \"NT15\", in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't68'\nNT15 \u2192 't43'\nAdditionally, lines like NT13 \u2192 't28', etc., but that's under NT13.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, the \"t\" productions are listed separately. Let me look:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see lines like:\n\n\"NT15 -> 't71'\", \"NT15 -> 't35'\", \"NT23 -> 't34'\", etc. Wait, no, that's not how it's written. The grammar seems to list non-terminals and their productions with either other non-terminals or terminals (in some cases, 't' seems to be used, like \"t71\", \"t35\", etc., which are likely the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Looking again:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT15, I think I see:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar as a list of production rules:\n\n...\n\"NT15 -> \"t40'\", \"NT15 -> \"t84'\", \"NT15 -> \"t15'\"), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string given is made up of t75, t43, etc., which are the terminals, so each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nNow, looking back, in the grammar, I don't see any terminal beyond 't71', 't35', etc., being directly produced by some non-terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see \"NT15 -> 't71'\", \"NT15 -> 't35'\", \"NT23 -> 't34'\", etc. So the terminals are specific strings like 't71', 't35', etc.\n\nBut the given string uses \"t75\", \"t43\", etc. So I need to check if each \"t\" in the string corresponds to a non-terminal production in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps each \"t\" is a terminal generated by a single non-terminal, and the non-terminals can only generate a single terminal each. So for each \"txxx\" in the string, I need to check if there's a non-terminal that can produce that exact string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can list out all possible terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nFor example, \"t71\" is produced by NT15: \"NT15 \u2192 't71'\", so \"t71\" can only be derived from NT15.\n\nSimilarly, \"t43\" is produced by NT14: \"NT14 \u2192 '43'\", and also possibly NT32 is produced by something else\u2014I need to check.\n\nWait, actually, let's parse the grammar properly. The grammar is given as a series of productions. I think the correct way is to look at each non-terminal and its possible productions, which may be other non-terminals (for the first part) and terminals (the 't' followed by numbers).\n\nBut in the given grammar, I need to determine which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, here are the direct terminal productions (I'll note which non-terminals correspond to which terminals):\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't59'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't21'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71' (multiple times)\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n- NT2 \u2192 't80'\n- NT12 \u2192 't78'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't43' (because NT13 \u2192 't43', perhaps?

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That makes parsing easier with algorithms like CYK, but since I'm just doing it manually, I'll try to break it down.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2.

Let me check each one:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24 (production 34)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12 (production 2)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24 (from line 34)\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12 (from line 2)\n\nWait, no, line 2 is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so NT32 is S's starting symbol.\n\nWait, checking NT32:\n\nNT32 appears in several productions:\n\nLooking down the list:\n\nLine 34: NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24\n\nLine 2: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 (But S is the start symbol, so NT32 is one of its components)\n\nAdditionally, looking at the non-terminal NT32's productions:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24 (line 34)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT12 (line 2?) Wait, no, line 2 is S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nWait, looking again, line 34: NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24\n\nLine 7: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\nSo NT32 can be replaced by NT18 NT24 or other things. Similarly, looking further down, NT32 is also produced by other non-terminals, like NT28 \u2192 NT32 NT15, but that's for NT28.\n\nWait, no, NT32 is directly the start symbol's components, but other non-terminals can also produce NT32.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently.

The string starts with t21, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which production could start with t21?\n\nLooking through the terminals, t21 is in production NT7: NT7 \u2192 t1 (line 9) and also other NTs.\n\nWait, looking at the list of productions, I see that NT7 is defined as:\n- NT7 \u2192 t1 (line 9)\n- NT24 \u2192 t53 (line 69)\n- NT7 \u2192 t40 (line 7)\n- NT24 \u2192 t72 (line 44)\n- NT5 \u2192 t49 (line 49)\n- NT19 \u2192 t1 (line 19)\n- NT28 \u2192 t82 (line 82)\n- NT2 \u2192 t49 (line 49)\n- NT32 \u2192 t63 (line 63)\n- NT2 \u2192 t28 (line 26)\n- NT0 \u2192 t40 (line 5)\n- NT23 \u2192 t70 (line 70)\n- NT29 \u2192 t62 (line 62)\n- NT24 \u2192 t12 (line 12)\n- NT24 \u2192 t78 (line 78)\n- NT3 \u2192 t1 (line 3)\n- NT19 \u2192 t15 (line 15)\n- NT6 \u2192 t58 (line?)

{"custom_id":"request-885","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S which can have two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems quite extensive with many non-terminal symbols (NT) and multiple production rules. The string to evaluate is a long sequence of terminals, mostly 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are unique identifiers for the terminal symbols.\n\nTo approach this, I'll consider the structure of the grammar. Each production rule combines two non-terminals, which eventually will be expanded into terminals. The string provided has 41 symbols, which is quite long, but given the grammar's rules, it's possible that it generated such a string.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several productions where non-terminals are expanded into pairs of non-terminals. For example, S -> NT32 NT14, which means the start symbol S is directly connected to two other non-terminals. This suggests that any string generated by the grammar will be a combination of pairs.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few elements are 't35', 't82', etc. I wonder if these correspond to terminal symbols derived from specific non-terminals. For instance, 't82' might come from a production rule like NT22 -> 't82' or something similar. I'll have to check the grammar for which non-terminals expand into these.\n\nThe problem is that manually tracing each step would take too long given the complexity of the grammar. I'll need to find a pattern or see if there are any obvious contradictions.\n\nAnother observation is that 't71' and 't80' appear multiple times. For example, 't71' is one of the terminals that comes from NT0 via NT0 -> 't71'. Similarly, 't80' comes from NT24, according to the grammar. So if the grammar includes rules where these non-terminals are used, the string would include these terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I see that 't82' is listed, and in the grammar, there's a production for NT17 -> 't68' and others. But wait, maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce 't82'. For instance, NT28 -> 't82' is directly mentioned in the grammar, so 't82' is a direct terminal from NT28.\n\nSimilarly, 't62' comes from NT29 via NT29 -> 't62', and 't52' comes from NT25 -> 't52'. So, each 't' terminal is directly from a specific non-terminal.\n\nNow, the big question is whether the entire string can be derived through a series of left or right derivations using the grammar rules. Given the length of the string, it's impossible to trace each step manually, so I'll need to find an alternative method.\n\nPerhaps I can parse the string using the top-down approach, starting from the start symbol S and recursively expanding it into the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is CNF, I might look for ways to group the string into the required number of symbols at each step.\n\nBut another approach is to realize that in a CNF grammar, the derivation must produce a string of length equal to the number of steps, where each step is a split in the production. For example, each production splits into two symbols. So, starting with S, each step would generate two symbols, leading to a string of length 2^k after k steps. However, since the string here has 41 symbols, which is not a power of two, that might indicate a problem, but wait, no\u2014the string isn't directly the result of splits but the result of all the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of symbols doesn't directly relate because the grammar can have multiple layers of expansions. But 41 is a prime number, which complicates things. Maybe the number of steps isn't the issue here.\n\nAnother thought: since each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, the parse tree must be a binary tree, which suggests that the length of the string being parsed would have to have a derivation length that could accommodate it. However, since the string's length is 41, it's an odd number, which could complicate the binary tree structure.\n\nWait, wait\u2014it's not the number of symbols but the structure of the tree that matters. The grammar uses NT symbols, and each rule splits two into two, but when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, the length depends on how deeply nested the replacements are. For example, starting with S (1), each expansion could increase the depth by 1, leading to 2, 4, 8, etc., but 41 isn't a power of two. Hmm, perhaps the string can't be derived from S through binary splits because 41 isn't a power of two, but maybe other factors are in play. However, considering the grammar's complexity, the string length might not directly determine the possibility.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for specific patterns. For example, the string starts with 't35 t82'. Looking at the grammar, 't35' comes from NT31 via NT31 -> 't35' (from the production NT31 -> 't35'). Similarly, 't82' comes from NT28 -> 't82'. So, perhaps the first two symbols in the string are the terminals from NT31 and NT28.\n\nNow, looking back at the grammar, NT28 has two productions: NT28 -> 't82' and NT28 -> NT28 NT28. So, the first 't82' is directly from NT28, which is possible.\n\nNext, 't62' is from NT29 -> 't62'. So, after 't82', we have 't62'. But in the grammar, NT29's only production is NT29 -> 't62', so that's straightforward.\n\nThen comes 't52' from NT25 -> 't52'. So far, so good.\n\nNext, 't72' from NT15 -> 't72'. Wait, but the grammar has NT15 -> 't43', 't35', 't15'. Oh, wait, that's confusing. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with a lot of production rules. I found that NT15 has productions to 't35', 't15', and 't43'. So, 't72' isn't a direct terminal from NT15, which complicates things. Because if the string has 't72', it's not directly from NT15.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n\n- NT28 -> 't72' is one production, and another is NT28 -> 't72 t74'?\n\nNo, let's see: in the provided grammar, NT28 has multiple productions:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28, NT28 -> NT21 NT25,\n\nNT28 -> NT21 NT28, NT28 -> NT25 NT21,\n\nNT28 -> NT0 NT25, NT28 -> NT25 NT0,\n\nand NT28 -> NT21 NT25,\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me look again: the user wrote:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT28 NT28\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT21 NT25\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT21 NT28\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT25 NT21\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT0 NT25\"\n\n\"NT28 -> NT25 NT0\"\n\nAnd also:\n\n\"NT28 -> NT29 NT28\"\n\nAh, okay. So in addition to splitting, NT28 can be 't72' via NT28's production.\n\nWait, looking back, the string after 't52' is 't72'. So, 't72' comes from NT28 -> 't72'. So the next symbol is 't72' from NT28. So yes, that's possible.\n\nThen comes 't74' which is from NT28 -> 't74'. So 't74' is a direct production of NT28.\n\nHmm, then 't6 t64 t68' are in the string. Wait, for example, 't6' comes from NT1 -> 't6'.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. I need to check whether each step from the string matches the grammar's productions.\n\nBut considering the complexity, perhaps there's a mistake. For example, 't35' comes from NT31, but in the grammar, does NT31 have any other productions? Yes, NT31 is productioned into 't35' or other non-terminals. So, the first symbol is fine, as it's a direct terminal.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol 't82' is from NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But some rules like NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT20 or NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT30, both non-terminals. Also, some rules like NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT5, but NT15 has productions like NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal. Wait, but NT15 is a non-terminal, so that's a production from NT15 to a terminal\u2014so that's allowed in CNF because the right-hand side can have a single terminal.\n\nWait, but not all non-terminals have such terminals. For example, NT15 might be a problem because its production is a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Let me check another rule: NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11, which is okay since it's two non-terminals. But NT15 has multiple rules, some starting with NT15 -> NT21 NT24 (two non-terminals), some to 't71', and some to 't35' or 't69'. So the problem is that some productions from NT15 produce terminals, which is allowed in CNF, but other non-terminals might have issues.\n\nBut wait, according to CNF, non-terminals should only produce other non-terminals or terminals. It seems that some non-terminals (like NT15) have productions to terminals, which is acceptable. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe target string is a long sequence of 't's with numbers, which are probably the terminals. Looking at the grammar, each non-terminal has productions to either two non-terminals or a terminal. So when parsing from the start symbol S, we need to see if we can expand S through non-terminals until we reach terminals that match the given string.\n\nThe string is: t72 t26 t62 t84 t28 t12 t84 t12 t74 t22 t12 t43 t34 t70 t22 t59 t12 t43 t69 t79 t49 t43 t70 t52 t21 t52 t17 t62 t33 t56 t75 t59 t82 t75 t34 t74 t33 t80 t32 t28 t53 t33 t56 t28 t33 t68 t53.\n\nSo, I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is quite large, maybe I can use a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if the given string can be divided into the productions of the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string must be a derivation starting from S, applying productions until only terminals remain, matching the string in order.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to note that the grammar has some start symbol S, which can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So each S production has two non-terminals, followed by another two non-terminals, but that's S's left-hand side. Alternatively, from S, we can produce two non-terminals, like NT32 and NT14. But the string starts with t72, which is a terminal. So we need to check which non-terminals can produce t72.\n\nLooking at all the non-terminals and their productions, I can build a list of which non-terminals produce which terminals. For instance:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1: but wait, in the grammar, I see NT34 has rules like NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1 or other NT combinations. Hmm, this might be getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the production rules that generate each terminal in the string, starting from S. For example, starting with S, it produces two non-terminals, say A and B. Then A must produce a terminal (like t72), and B must produce the rest of the string, or another non-terminal.\n\nBut this approach might take too long because the string is long.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all the terminals in the string can be generated by some non-terminals in the grammar. For example, each 't' in the string must correspond to some production of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, many of them have terminals in their productions. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT1 \u2192 't6', NT0 \u2192 't40', etc. So each non-terminal might have some terminals it can directly produce.\n\nNow, I can map which non-terminals can generate which terminals:\n\nLet me list some:\n\n- NT34 can produce t74? Wait, looking at NT34's rules:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT24 NT18\nNT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1\n\nWait, nowhere does NT34 produce a terminal t74. Looking further, perhaps in another part: NT16 (not listed in the provided grammar), but in the given grammar, it's not present. So perhaps some NT's produce certain t's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead look at the string and see if the first terminal can be produced by any non-terminal.\n\nThe first symbol is t72. Looking at all production rules, which NT can produce t72?\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10\n- NT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\n- NT17 \u2192 NT8 NT0\n- NT28 \u2192 NT12 NT53\nWait, looking for NT that can produce t72:\n\nLooking through all productions, it seems that NT40 has some rules, but in the given grammar, for example, NT0 \u2192 't71', 't32', 't53', etc. So perhaps NT0 can produce t72? Wait, looking more closely, in the grammar, NT0 has several rules like:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\nNT0 \u2192 NT21 NT20\nNT0 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nNT0 \u2192 't32'\nNT0 \u2192 't53'\nNT0 \u2192 't84'\n\nWait, no, the first symbol in the string is t72. None of the NTs directly produce t72 in the given grammar. Wait, I need to check all the given NTs.\n\nLooking through all the productions, which non-terminals have a terminal as terminal in their productions.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT12 \u2192 't78'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, so looking through all the NT productions, their terminals are:\n\nt1, t6, t40, t34, t82, t28, t78, t26, t49, t68, t28, t56.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t72, which is not present on the list of terminals generated by any NT in the grammar.\n\nSo that's a problem. Since the grammar doesn't have any non-terminals that can directly produce t72, the very first symbol cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first terminal t72 isn't produced by any rule in the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-907","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens: t64, t72, t40, t72, t19, t59, t25, t59, t84, t46, t79, t6, t80, t52, t22, t34, t64, t25, t49, t25, t71, t70, t53, t78, t78, t84, t12, t62, t70, t21, t75, t34, t6, t63, t15, t69, t6, t63, t68, t71, t49, t6, t6, t71, t17, t42, t40. \n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to have a mix of both types. Wait, actually, looking at the productions, they all seem to produce either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something? Hmm, maybe I misread. Wait, no, CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Some of these productions have a mix, like S \u2192 NT32 NT32. Wait, no, maybe the grammar includes both terminals and non-terminals in production. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are either two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC) or a single terminal (A \u2192 a). So perhaps I need to check the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, I see some productions like S -> NT32 NT32, which is A \u2192 BC, and others like NT15 -> 't71' which is A \u2192 a, a terminal. So yes, it's in CNF because each production has exactly one non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal followed by something? Wait, no, wait, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with a being a terminal. But in some cases, the productions have more on the right, like NT7 -> NT14 NT23. Wait, that's just two non-terminals, so that's fine. Wait, but then there are productions where the right-hand side includes terminals? Hmm, no, because 't' tokens are terminals. Wait, so the grammar allows both non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side. That can't be right because in CNF, the right-hand side should consist of exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. So perhaps the grammar is not in proper CNF, but looking more closely, actually, each production either has two non-terminals or a terminal as the only element. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, looking again: the productions are like S -> NT32 NT32, which is A \u2192 BC, yes. Then there's NT15 -> 't71', which is A \u2192 a. Then others like NT7 -> NT14 NT23, so A \u2192 BC. Another is S -> NT18 NT32, which is A \u2192 BC. All other productions are similarly either two non-terminals or a terminal. So yes, the grammar is in CNF because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nNow, I need to check if the given string is in the language generated by this grammar. The string starts with t64, which is a terminal, and ends with t40, another terminal. Since the grammar starts with S, which can produce strings of terminals and non-terminals, but the entire string is made up of terminals, that's fine.\n\nTo determine if this string is generated, I can think about how the leftmost derivation works in a CFG in CNF. Each step replaces a non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the target string is entirely terminals, the derivation must eventually eliminate all non-terminals through productions that produce terminals.\n\nI can try to see if each terminal in the string is generated by some rule that directly produces it. Looking through the grammar, I see several NT's that produce terminals like 't71', 't72', 't64', etc. So the method is to check if each t in the string is produced by a rule where A \u2192 a, with a being that t.\n\nLet's list all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals they can come from:\n\nt64: From N->t40? Wait, no. Looking at the production: NT34 -> 't12' and NT19 -> 't1'... Wait, no, looking back, I see NTS like NT34 -> 't72' and NT5 -> 't68', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the production rules that end with a terminal. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nNT15 -> 't71' (terminal)\nNT15 -> 't35'\nNT15 -> 't33'\nNT0 -> 't40' (so NT0 can produce t40)\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT23 -> 't21'\nNT29 -> 't28'\nNT24 -> 't72' (so NT24 can produce t72)\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1' (I think, wait, NT19 -> 't1'?

I should also see that the terminals in the string are words like 't80', 't79', etc., which might correspond to the right-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nI'll start by checking if each 't' in the string is present in the grammar. Looking through each production rule, I see that some 't's are terminals, such as 't40', 't34', 't72', etc. However, some 't's seem to be used differently. For example, 't71' appears in a production rule where NT0 produces 't71', and similarly, 't1' appears in NT1. \n\nThe string has a lot of 't's, so I need to make sure that each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Let me go through each token in the string:\n\n1. t80: Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 't71', but there's no rule for t80. Wait, in the grammar, there's a production where NT24 \u2192 't72', and another where S \u2192 't35'. Hmm, maybe I need to check if 't80' is a terminal or derived symbol. Checking through the rules, I don't see an explicit production for t80 except in S \u2192 't35', which is a terminal. So 't80' doesn't appear directly in any production except as part of other non-terminals, but looking at the rules, I don't see 't80' as a terminal except in the string provided. So perhaps 't80' is a mistake because it's not a terminal in the grammar. Alternatively, maybe it's used as a terminal in some rule I'm missing.\n\nWait, looking again, the production rules only go up to NT34, and I don't see any production for NT2 or others that result in 't80'. So maybe 't80' isn't a valid terminal in the grammar, making the string invalid because it contains a terminal that isn't part of the grammar.\n\nBut let me double-check. The grammar has NT0 \u2192 't40', so 't40' is a terminal. There's a rule NT0 \u2192 't71', but no rule for 't80'. So 't80' isn't a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, if the string contains 't80', it's not possible unless it's derived from a non-terminal that expands to it. But looking through the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that produces 't80'. For example, NT23 \u2192 't71', NT25 \u2192 't64', etc., but none go to 't80'. So 't80' isn't present as a terminal in the grammar at all.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string should be invalid because it's generating a token ('t80') that the grammar can't produce. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-926","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF structures each production to have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one non-terminal on the right. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar is in CNF because every production right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal combined with something? Wait, no, looking at the productions again. Wait, actually, looking closer, a lot of the productions seem to have more than two symbols. Like S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, each production is generating exactly two symbols, each of which could be a non-terminal or a terminal. So, it's in CNF because each production is exactly two symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t28 t17 t15 t1 t33 t3 t28 t65 t3 t21 t70 t84 t21 t68 t72 t53 t56 t26 t64 t32 t84 t43 t82 t22 t33 t74 t34 t74 t35 t59 t49 t70 t62 t71 t78 t49 t63 t49 t62 t69 t75 t43 t52 t84 t22 t75 t82 t3.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar. One approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses strings in CNF grammars. But manually applying CYK for such a long string would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that t9 is a terminal. Looking at the productions, t9 is in NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6. But wait, in the given string, there's a 't9' which might correspond to NT24. Let me check which production has 't9'. Looking through the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 't9' is present in two places: once as NT24 \u2192 't72' because NT24 is used to produce t72, and also other places like NT5 -> 't68', etc. Wait, no, looking more carefully, the productions for NT24 include NT24 \u2192 't72' and others involving NT24. Hmm, but wait, sometimes I see NT24 -> 't72' and also in the NT23 production. Also, looking at the string, there's a t9 somewhere, so perhaps I should see how t9 is derived.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string, I notice t1, t3, t7, t34, etc. The start symbol is S, which produces two NT symbols: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first two non-terminals would be NT32 and NT14. Now, I need to see if the first symbol of the string can be generated by NT32, the second by NT14, and then their combinations produce the subsequent symbols. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is two symbols, but the CFG can directly produce terminals, so the first step is to see if t28 appears as a terminal in the productions. Looking through the productions, I see that t28 is a terminal in some NT productions. Like NT14 \u2192 't43', and then in other places too. So, perhaps I can start by checking the possible expansions.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for the structure of the string. Let me see the string: it starts with t28, followed by t17, t15, t1, etc. I notice that t17 is also a terminal in the productions. So, perhaps the string can be broken down into chunks that correspond to non-terminals and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step, even if it's extensive. Let me see the start symbol S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first step is to produce NT32 and NT14, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT32 in the productions, I see NT32 \u2192 't75' (from NT24: NT24 \u2192 't72' or other terminals) and also NT32 is in NT24 \u2192 't72', but perhaps I'm getting confused here. Wait, I think in the list, NT32 is listed as producing 't75'. So NT32 can produce the terminal t75. So the first symbol in the string is t28, which is different from t75. So if the string starts with t28, then the first production must not involve NT32 immediately. Hmm, but S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So maybe the first symbols generated are NT32 and NT14. So perhaps t28 is generated by NT14 or NT32. Let me see: in the productions, NT14 \u2192 't43' and NT32 \u2192 't75'. So neither of these produce t28. So perhaps either NT32 or NT14 must expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of terminals, which could be the result of some non-terminals expanding into these terminals. So for example, perhaps a non-terminal like NT17 can produce t28, and another non-terminal like NT30 can produce t75 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the whole string can be generated by a series of non-terminals expanding into these t symbols. Since the string is quite long, there's a chance that it could be valid, but perhaps it's not. Maybe one of the symbols doesn't match any terminal productions.\n\nWait, let's list all the terminals present in the string: t28, t17, t15, t1, t33, t3, t28, t65, t3, t21, t70, t84, t21, t68, t72, t53, t56, t26, t64, t32, t84, t43, t82, t22, t33, t74, t34, t74, t35, t59, t49, t70, t62, t71, t78, t49, t63, t49, t62, t69, t75, t43, t52, t84, t22, t75, t82, t3.\n\nLooking at the productions, I can see which NTs produce which terminals. For instance, NT28 has a production \u2192 't82' and 't35'. NT25 \u2192 't64', and so on. So checking t9 is produced by NT24. Wait, let me check all the NTs that have terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't6' is a production, but it's a single terminal, so that's allowed (produces a single 't6').\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'.\n- NT13 \u2192 't28' appears in NT28 \u2192 't82' and others? Wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the productions, for NT24 \u2192 't72', etc. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note which NTs can produce which terminals. Let's list that:\n\nFrom the given productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't82' (as per NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28, but also as per NT28 \u2192 't82' and 't35' from somewhere?) Wait, no, in the given list, under NT28, it produces 't82' and 't35'. So NT28 \u2192 't82' is a production, so t82 comes from NT28.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72' and 't42'? Wait, no. Let me check the exact productions.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32\n- NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT22\n- NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT24 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n- NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT11\n- NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28\n- Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-946","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string that I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar is quite complicated with many productions, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols ending with 't59 t79 t40 t64...'.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of CNF. CNF means that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. Also, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. However, I notice that the given grammar has some productions that produce a single terminal, like NT15 \u2192 't71', but there are others that produce two symbols, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14 which produces two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each rule must have exactly two non-terminals on the right. But here, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is producing two non-terminals, which is fine for CNF because in CNF, A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. However, the presence of terminals in productions (like S \u2192 't59 t79') complicates things because if the string has a production that produces a terminal, the string can only be generated if exactly one of the productions in the derivation produces the terminal, and the others produce non-terminals which can be further expanded.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. In CNF, it's allowed for the productions on the right-hand side to be terminals, but actually, that's not standard. Typically, in CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar provided has some mixed productions, which might not be in standard CNF. But the user specified that it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so maybe it's allowed. Wait, but in standard CNF, all productions must have two non-terminals on the right. So perhaps the presence of terminal symbols in the productions is not allowed, which suggests that maybe the provided grammar isn't in standard CNF because some of the rules produce a single terminal. But the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the CNF here refers to a specific form, but perhaps some rules can produce a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it's augmented CNF, allowing terminals on the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given CFG is in CNF except for some rules. For example, looking at the grammar, I see some rules that are S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. Then, S \u2192 NT18 NT32, also two non-terminals. NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which is N terminals. So each rule is as per CNF: no terminals, only non-terminals, each rule is A \u2192 BC. So it's in CNF. So the start symbol S can produce NT32 NT14 for example, and each production is two non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, but the given string starts with t59, which is a terminal. So perhaps the grammar can produce terminals, which means it's an extended version of CNF. But CNF only allows two non-terminals. So if a terminal is allowed on the right side, that's not standard CNF. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement, but I think the focus is on processing the string given.\n\nThus, the given string has a series of symbols ending with ..., t46, t6, t70, t75, t69, t77, t42, t33. So the string is: t59 t26 t59 t74 t63 t3 t74 t25 t1 t59 t63 t1 t68 t21 t46 t84 t65 t40 t69 t49 t6 t84 t32 t59 t33 t52 t70 t82 t64 t77 t21 t74 t17 t28 t28 t19 t15 t49 t12 t72 t62 t46 t6 t70 t75 t69 t77 t42 t33.\n\nGiven that each production is two non-terminals, except for some that produce terminals, but in our case, all the productions are supposed to have two non-terminals except for perhaps the ones allowing terminals, but if the string has a terminal, then the derivation must have a step where one of the non-terminals produces a terminal.\n\nBut each step in a derivation using CNF requires that each non-terminal is replaced by a pair of non-terminals. So the length of the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of steps, because each step doubles the number of symbols. For example, if the start symbol S is expanded into two non-terminals, each of those might expand into two each, etc. So the number of symbols after n steps is 2^n.\n\nLooking at the given string's length: Let's count the number of tokens.\n\nThe string is: t59 t26 t59 t74 t63 t3 t74 t25 t1 t59 t63 t1 t68 t21 t46 t84 t65 t40 t69 t49 t6 t84 t32 t59 t33 t52 t70 t82 t64 t77 t21 t74 t17 t28 t28 t19 t15 t49 t12 t72 t62 t46 t6 t70 t75 t69 t77 t42 t33.\n\nLet me count them: Starting from the first 't59', and each space is a separation. Let me count them one by one:\n\n1. t59\n2. t26\n3. t59\n4. t74\n5. t63\n6. t3\n7. t74\n8. t25\n9. t1\n10. t59\n11. t63\n12. t1\n13. t68\n14. t21\n15. t46\n16. t84\n17. t65\n18. t40\n19. t69\n20. t49\n21. t6\n22. t84\n23. t32\n24. t59\n25. t33\n26. t52\n27. t70\n28. t82\n29. t64\n30. t77\n31. t21\n32. t74\n33. t17\n34. t28\n35. t28\n36. t19\n37. t15\n38. t49\n39. t12\n40. t72\n41. t62\n42. t46\n43. t6\n44. t70\n45. t75\n46. t69\n47. t77\n48. t42\n49. t33.\n\nSo the length is 49 tokens. But in CNF, the number of symbols after each step doubles. For example, starting from S which is one symbol, after one step it's two, then four, etc. So the length would be 2^n. So if the length is not a power of two, it can't be generated. 49 is not a power of two since 2^5=32, 2^6=64, so 49 is between them. So that's a red flag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong about that because with non-terminals, perhaps the string can be a mixture of terminals and non-terminals, but the length still needs to be even because each step in CNF splits each non-terminal into two. So the total number of symbols after each step must always be even because starting from S (1, which is a non-terminal), then each step replaces each non-terminal into two, so the total number must always be a power of two.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string starts with a terminal t59, which suggests that in the derivation, one of the non-terminals at some point has produced a terminal. But in CNF, all productions are either A\u2192BC, which are non-terminals, or A\u2192a, a terminal. But since the entire string has terminals, perhaps the grammar allows the start symbol to produce terminals. Alternatively, perhaps in this grammar, certain non-terminals produce terminals, but I need to see.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some rules produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', etc. So"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-945","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, I see that most rules have two non-terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT32 NT32. That seems fine for CNF since CNF allows two non-terminals, but I noticed some rules like S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which also have two non-terminals. Wait, but in CNF, the right-hand side can also have exactly two non-terminals, so that seems okay.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string using the grammar. The string is: t70 t1 t43 t1 t62 t78 t80 t25 t21 t19 t21 t64 t65 t35 t22 t34 t82 t79 t49 t56 t34 t17 t33 t32 t77 t68 t26 t25 t56 t69 t22 t64 t82 t46 t84 t19 t15 t6 t35 t56 t12 t80 t64 t12 t42 t79 t63 t53 t63.\n\nI know that each production in CNF produces exactly two non-terminals, so the derivation will be a sequence of these two steps until you reach terminals. Each step reduces a non-terminal into two, eventually leading to leaves in the parse tree. So, the string should have length related to the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nWait, more accurately, the number of terminals in the string should be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. For a CFG in CNF, the maximum number of symbols after k steps is 2^k. But if the derivation starts with S and each step branches into two non-terminals, the total number of symbols (including non-terminals) increases. However, our goal is to find if the string can be derived exactly.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think about the structure of the grammar. Let's see the grammar rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT32\nAlso S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nOther non-terminals like NT30, NT4, NT24, etc., have productions that break down into other non-terminals and\/or terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals, like NT23 \u2192 't34' or NT0 \u2192 't40'. So these are terminal symbols, which means these non-terminals are the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nSo, perhaps I can start from the root, S, and see how it can produce the given string. The string starts with t70, so I need to see which production rules lead to t70 being a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT31 \u2192 't69'. Wait, but does that produce t70? Let's check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT23 \u2192 't34', which is a terminal. But I'm looking for t70. Let me check all non-terminals that produce a terminal t70. Scanning the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t70. Wait, perhaps it's a non-terminal that can produce t70 through a series of steps.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT23 \u2192 't34' and NT22 \u2192 't3'. Similarly, NT24 \u2192 't12' and others. Is there a non-terminal that produces t70? Let me check all the rules for terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't28', NT0 \u2192 't40', NT23 \u2192 't34', NT24 \u2192 't12', etc. I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't70'. So perhaps 't70' is the start of the string derived from a non-terminal that goes into a path that eventually produces 't70'.\n\nWait, looking back, NT22 \u2192 't3', and there's NH22 \u2192 other rules. Wait, let me check the rules for each non-terminal step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a production that can lead to 't70'. Let me check all the non-terminals and see if any of them produce 't70' directly or indirectly.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't12' and others, but none produce t70.\n\nWait, I see NT24 \u2192 't72', and NT24 can be further split. Let me check if t72 is a terminal or not. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t72. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree for the given string and see if it matches any derivation from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation will split a non-terminal into two, each of which are either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check for each production where the string can be broken down using the grammar rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the production rules can be applied step by step to reach the given string. For example, starting from S \u2192 NT32 NT32, but looking at the string, the first symbol is t70, so the first NT32 must produce t70 somehow. But from the grammar, I don't immediately see how NT32 can produce t70.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns in the string. The string starts with t70 t1 t43...\n\nLooking at the start, maybe the initial non-terminal is NT7, since NT7 \u2192 't1' is a production. So if NT7 is t7, then the first part makes sense. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 \u2192 't1' (from NT7 \u2192 't46'), wait, no\u2014more accurately, NT7 can derive to 't1' via NT7 \u2192 't1', but let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, NT7 \u2192 't46' (from NT7 \u2192 't46'), but also other rules. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me check carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10\nNT17 \u2192 NT22 NT10\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT32\nNT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15\n...\nWait, perhaps I should look for how to split the given string using the rules.\n\nThe first symbol is 't70'. So, we need a production that can start with 't70'. Looking through rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't70'. So perhaps 't70' is the first derived terminal from a non-terminal that eventually splits into something that ends in 't70'.\n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps I'm mislooking. Let me check all rules where 't70' could appear. For example, looking through the list, none of the non-terminals directly produce a 't70' as a terminal, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Or maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules again, I see that NT23 \u2192 't34', NT22 \u2192 't3', NT24 \u2192 't72', etc. But nowhere do I see 't70' being a terminal. Hmm. That suggests that maybe t70 is a non-terminal and the derivation from S leads to t70 via certain rules.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the string starts with t70, which should be a terminal symbol in the string. Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding\u2014perhaps t70 is a non-terminal, but then how do we derive a terminal symbol t70?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production S splits into two non-terminals, each leading to parts of the string, eventually leading to t70.\n\nBut this seems confusing. Let me try to see if any production rules can lead to longer chains that result in t70 somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to break down the entire string step by step, looking for matches in the grammar.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt70, t1, t43, t1, t62, t78, t80, t25, t21, t19, t21, t64, t65, t35, t22, t34, t82, t79, t49, t56, t34, t17, t33, t32, t77, t68, t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-962","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of non-terminal symbols and production rules. The start symbol is S, which has two initial productions: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So, whatever string we generate must ultimately come from these two productions.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, like `t43 t22 t70 ...`, up to `t75`, etc. Each token seems to represent a terminal symbol, possibly a non-terminal as well if I misread, but looking at the grammar, I think most are terminals since they end with 't' and numbers. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that convert into terminal symbols, like NT2 -> NT22 NT15, which eventually in the grammar have 't' followed by numbers or other symbols.\n\nBut actually, in the given string, I see terms like `t43`, which I think are terminal symbols, but how? The grammar has non-terminals that can produce terminal symbols after several steps. So the string must be a sequence of symbols that can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe initial productions of S are either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So, every string generated by this grammar will ultimately be a combination of these starting points, meaning sequences starting with NT32 or NT18, followed by NT14, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with `t43`, which seems like a terminal symbol. So, let's see where `t43` comes from. In the grammar, I see that NT4 has a production: NT4 -> NT25 NT20. And in the right-hand side, NT25 is 't56', and NT20 is 't63'. Wait, no, looking again, actually, in the grammar, some of the non-terminals have productions that go directly to terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't35', 't21', 't24', etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals have productions that end in 't' with different suffixes, like 't71', 't70', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals can produce terminal symbols, but the initial productions for S are NT-based, so the string must be a sequence of terminals that can be derived from these NT non-terminals.\n\nSo, for example, S -> NT32 NT14: each of NT32 and NT14 can be further broken down into non-terminals, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a concatenation of terminals, so each of these tokens like `t43` must be directly derived from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to trace a possible derivation. Starting from S, using S -> NT32 NT14, then:\n\n1. NT32 is in the grammar, let's see its productions. Looking through the grammar, I see NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT25 NT6. NT25 has NT24 NT20, etc. Hmm, but I might be getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals produce 't' terminals directly. For example, NT23 -> 't34', which is a terminal. So, if a non-terminal can directly produce a 't' followed by a number, that's a terminal.\n\nBut wait, let me make a list of which non-terminals can produce which terminals. That might help.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, we have NT15 producing 't35', 't21', 't24', etc. NT7 -> 't1', etc. Similarly, NT0->'t40', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal eventually reduces to a single 't' with some number, but the string consists of several such 't' terms.\n\nLooking at the given string: \n\nt43, t22, t70, t21, t42, t80, t34, t75, t33, t15, t69, t26, t6, t33, t79, t17, t25, t21, t35, t62, t70, t34, t82, t19, t19, t3, t70, t52, t49, t49, t75, t3, t79, t65, t15, t74, t56, t63, t71, t17, t77, t26, t74, t53, t65, t64, t22, d22, t52, t33.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of this as a sequence of productions where each NT is replaced by terminals or other NTs until everything is a terminal.\n\nBut this might take a long time to parse manually, especially with a long string. Maybe a better approach is to see if each token in the string corresponds to a valid production. For example, check whether each 't' followed by a number is a terminal or derived from an NT.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, most of the NTs eventually produce terminal strings, but how? For example, NT7 has a production NT7 -> 't1'. So 't1' is a terminal that can be produced directly by NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 -> 't53', etc. But in the string, I see 't43', which is not a terminal in the grammar, unless I misread.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar has rules like NT15 -> 't35', 't21', 't24', etc. But I don't see any NT that directly produces 't43'. Wait, maybe I need to see which NTs can derive into 't43' through production chains.\n\nLooking back, for example, NT4 has a production NT4 -> NT25 NT6. NT25 has production NT25 -> NT27 NT10, etc. But perhaps eventually, NT25 or NT6 can produce 't43'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't43' is an initial non-terminal node. Wait, no, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each token like 't43' must come from an NT that has a production that includes that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any NT with a production that directly produces 't43'. Hmm. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the grammar again to find if any NTs have 't43' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1' (and other possibilities)\n- NT2 -> 't49'\n- NT4-> 't56'\n- NT30-> 't26'\n- NT5-> 't68'\n- NT14-> 't43' (Wait, yes! NT14 has a production NT14 -> 't43' in the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the initial grammar, S can produce NT14, and looking in the grammar, NT14 has a production NT14 -> 't43'. So S can go to NT14 and that can produce 't43' in one step. So the string starts with 't43', which is OK.\n\nSimilarly, the next token is 't22'. Let's see where 't22' comes from. Looking for NT22: in the grammar, I see NT22 appears in several rules:\n\n- NT8 -> NT11 NT10\n- NT13 -> NT6 NT18\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT15\n- NT28 -> NT28 NT28\n- NT7 -> NT22 NT5\n- Etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if any NT can produce 't22' directly. Looking through the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't22' (yes, in NT7's rules: NT7-> 't22'). So 't22' could be produced directly by NT7.\n\nSo, if the string is 't43 t22 t70...', then 't43' is from NT14, 't22' from NT7, then 't70' would need to come from another NT. Let's check NT70: Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT rule for NT70. Wait, maybe I'm mistyping. Looking for '70' as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't74', but that's 't74', not 't70'. Similarly, NT6 -> 't53', etc. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe 't70' is a terminal, and which NT can produce 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

No, that can't be because in the initial productions, S -> NT32 NT14, which would mean NT32 is part of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, the initial grammar given is not correct. Because, looking at the production rules, NT32 is nowhere to be found.

Let's check if these produce 't82' and 't71'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT14 has a production that eventually results in 't71' and 't43' (I might be getting this wrong, but looking at NT15 and others, I see that some NTs produce 't's).\n\nBut looking back, NT32's productions: I need to find NT32's rules.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a specific form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see how it's structured. I notice that most of the productions are non-terminals transforming into other non-terminals and sometimes terminals. For example, the start symbol S has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. That means the string generated by S will be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT32 and NT14, or by NT18 and NT32.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, `t74 t75`, I see that it's composed of two terminals: t74 and t75.

I should check if there's a path where NT32 or NT14 can derive to 't74'.\n\nLooking at NT32: There's a production NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT322. I need to check if NT22 can derive to t74. Let's find NT22.\n\nLooking at NT22, its productions are:\n- NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT0\n- NT22 \u2192 NT0 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT21 NT18\n- NT22 \u2192 NT23 NT5\n- NT22 \u2192 NT7 NT22\n- NT22 \u2192 NT29 NT24\n- NT22 \u2192 NT34 NT18\n- NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n\nHmm, none of these directly give a terminal. Wait, but looking at NT22's productions, I see NT23 \u2192 't70', and NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. Let me check NT24 again.\n\nLooking at NT24, there are several productions. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32. NT7 is a non-terminal that produces 't40', so that's a terminal. NT32, again, leads to more non-terminals. But I'm looking for t74.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is `t74 t75`. Let me see how each can be formed.\n\nLooking at NT14: production NT14 \u2192 't43'. So if there's an NT14, it can become t43. Then, looking for t74 in the grammar, I find NT7 \u2192 't40', NT8 \u2192 't46', NT24 \u2192 't56', etc. But perhaps I need to find a way to get t74.\n\nWait, I see NT7 \u2192 't40' and NT4 \u2192 't56'. Maybe t74 is part of some longer production. Let me look for NT74, but I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't74'. Alternatively, maybe 't74' is part of a longer string, but I need exactly those two tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The string is `t74 t75`. I should see if S can produce this string.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's check both.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nWhat do NT32 and NT14 produce?\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT322. Let's see how NT2 and NT322 can produce something.\n\nNT2 has productions that sometimes lead to terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15, and NT15 can produce 't19', 't13', etc. Wait, looking back, NT15's productions are:\n- NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT5\n- NT15 \u2192 NT13 NT0\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo NT15 can produce 't71' or 't35', among others. But how do NT22 and NT322 fit into this?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is too complicated. Maybe I should look for another way. Let me consider that the string is `t74 t75`. I need to see if there's a way to derive 't74' from some non-terminal, and then 't75' from another.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT24 can produce 't56', and NT29 \u2192 't62', but that's not helpful. Wait, let me check NT22 again. NT22 \u2192 NT7 NT22. NT7 is 't40', so perhaps this leads to loops. Maybe there's a way to get 't74' from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should consider that t74 is not part of any production. Looking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t74. Wait, but wait: when I look at the terminal symbols, t74 and t75 are both terminal symbols in the given string. So perhaps they come from some non-terminals that can produce those terminals.\n\nLooking back, for NT7, it's 't40'; NT9 \u2192 't49'; NT14 \u2192 't43'; NT22 has several non-terminals, but none produce t74. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at NT31: its production includes NT35, but that's a non-terminal. Similarly, NT33 \u2192 't52', NT29 \u2192 't62', etc. None of these produce 't74'.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check NT17: production NT17 \u2192 't68'. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe NT31 can produce 't35' and 't52', but again, not t74.\n\nWait, perhaps 't74' comes from NT24 \u2192 't12' or NT24 \u2192 't24'. Wait, let's look again at NT24.\n\nNT24 has several productions, including:\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32\n- NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT10\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 NT17 NT25\n- NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT21\n- NT24 \u2192 NT6 NT27\n- NT24 \u2192 NT23 NT5\n\nLooking at these, I can see that some of them lead to 't40' from NT7, 't56' from NT24 \u2192 't56', 't63' from NT27? Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking at NT27, I don't see it producing a terminal. Let me check NT27:\n\nNT27's productions are:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT25 NT27\n- NT27 \u2192 NT6 NT18\n\nHmm, no terminals. So NT27 doesn't produce any terminals except when part of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's see if the string `t74 t75` can be formed by S's productions. S can go to NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLet's take the first option: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, NT32 \u2192 NT2 NT322.

{"custom_id":"request-22","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if the string `t75 t22 t69` is generated by a given context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step because there's a lot going on here.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar provided. It's a series of productions where each non-terminal (like S, NT30, NT4, etc.) is split into two non-terminals until we get down to terminals, which are marked with 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string we're checking is `t75 t22 t69`, which consists of three terminals. Since each production in the grammar splits into exactly two parts (except for the start symbol S, which splits into two non-terminals as well), the derivation process would probably involve a binary tree, right? So for a string of three terminals, the parsing would require two steps where we split the initial symbol into non-terminals, which then produce the terminals.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the start symbol. The grammar starts with S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the string can only be generated by one of these two initial split points.\n\nNow, the string is `t75 t22 t69`. Let's count the tokens; there are three tokens, so each production needs to be split in such a way that we end up with three terminals. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So starting from S, the first step would produce two non-terminals, which then each produce their own non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has three terminals. In CNF, each production is left \u2192 two non-terminals. So starting with S, the first expansion would be two non-terminals, each expanding to two non-terminals, and so on, until terminals are reached. The number of terminals should correspond to 2^k for some k, but here it's three, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that seems odd. Wait, no: because the string has three tokens, which is 2^2 - 1, but I might be getting confused.\n\nWait no, I think I should approach this differently. Let's look at the productions and see how the terminals can be formed. Let me list out all the productions where a non-terminal leads to a terminal, because those would be the leaves in the parse tree.\n\nLooking through the grammar, non-terminals that directly produce terminals or 't' something are:\n\n- S: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n- NT32: multiple productions, but looking for 't'... For example, NT32 \u2192 't75' is present. Also, others like NT2 \u2192 't28' etc.\n- Wait, let me list all non-terminals that directly produce 't' something:\n\nNT32 \u2192 't75' (from production NT32 \u2192 't75')\nNT22 \u2192 't69' (from NT22 \u2192 't69')\nNT14 \u2192 't43' (from NT14 \u2192 't43')\nNT30 \u2192 't63' (from NT30 \u2192 't63')\nNT27 \u2192 't77' (from NT27 \u2192 't77')\nNT2 \u2192 't28' and other 't's\nNT14 \u2192 't43'\nAnd so on. So the terminals are scattered across various non-terminals.\n\nSo for the string `t75 t22 t69`, I need to see if there's a way to parse it as a sequence of productions from S, splitting into non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nLet me first examine the first terminal, 't75'. Looking at the grammar, NT32 can directly produce 't75', so one of the productions is S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see if 't75' can be part of one of these.\n\nAssume the first production from S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then the first part is NT32 and the second is NT14.\n\nNT32 can produce 't75' as a terminal, so that's good. Then NT14 produces 't43', but our string starts with 't75', so that would not match. Alternatively, maybe the first part is NT32, which produces 't75', and then NT14 needs to produce something else, but 't22' and 't69' are next.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe using a recursive descent parser or a top-down approach would help. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation would be the way to go.\n\nThe leftmost derivation would expand symbols from left to right, so the first non-terminal to expand would be S, then the left side (NT32), then NT32's expansion, and so on.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n1. Start with S: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n   So now we have NT32 NT14.\n\n2. Expand NT32:\n   Looking at the productions for NT32, there's one that produces 't75', but also other options. So NT32 can expand to 't75' (meaning it's a terminal), which would consume the first token. Then we're left with NT14.\n\n3. Now NT14 needs to produce 't22' and then 't69'? But wait, NT14 has production S \u2192 NT14 can expand into either NT31 NT9 or other options. Hmm, but in our case, we're expanding NT14 after 't75', so in a leftmost approach, maybe NT14 needs to split into something that starts with 't22'.\n\nBut NT14's productions include NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, or NT31 and NT21. Let's see: does NT31 or NT21 produce 't22'? NT31 has productions, one of which is NT31 \u2192 't22', right? Because looking up, NT31 \u2192 't22' is present.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. Yes, looking at the grammar, under NT31: NT31 \u2192 't69' is not shown, but I think earlier, I might have missed that. Wait, let me look through the list again.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, I see NT31 \u2192 't69' in one of the productions, but actually, no, wait: looking back at the user's message, the grammar has:\n\nLooking for NT31's productions:\n\nThe user provided a long list. Let me scan:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT33\nSo, I don't see NT31 directly producing 't22'. Wait, that's a problem because in the string, after 't75', the next is 't22'.\n\nWait, but earlier, looking at the grammar, I might have misread it. Let me check the list again.\n\nThe user wrote, under NT22: NT22 \u2192 't69' is one production. Wait, but in the grammar, there's:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT8 NT0.\n\nBut looking elsewhere, I see NT23 \u2192 't21' (among others), and other 't' productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me look for any non-terminals that can produce 't22'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar list, I don't see any production where a single non-terminal directly produces 't22'. Instead, it seems that 't22' is produced by a non-terminal that requires splitting further.\n\nWait, for example, looking for where 't22' is produced: in the list, I see production for NT30 \u2192 't26'. No, but checking the list, I don't see NT22 directly producing a 't' terminal. Instead, NT22's production is:\n\nLooking back, the production for NT22 is NT22 \u2192 't69', which is a terminal. Hmm, that's one possibility. Wait, no: looking at the user's list:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\nNT31 \u2192 't69' is produced by NT31. So NT31 can expand into 't69', yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 \u2192 't69' is another option.\n\nWait, but in our string, after 't75', we have 't22' and then 't69'. So, let me try to structure the derivation.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe need to produce 't75 t22 t69'.\n\nPossible breakdown: The first symbol is S. Let's assume the first production from S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nThen, NT32 produces 't75' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-24","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string `t75 t69 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and then the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a series of productions starting with the start symbol S. Each production seems to start with NT and sometimes have letters attached, like t75, t69, etc. Some of these symbols are non-terminals (NT), and others are terminals, which are the 't's followed by numbers I think. The task is to see if the string can be derived from S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the string `t75 t69 t69`, it's three tokens separated by spaces. So each token must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Let me scan through the grammar to see which NTs produce these t's.\n\nI notice that several NTs produce t's with numbers. For example:\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\nAnd a lot more with 't's.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for 't75', 't69', 't69'. Let me see if any NTs produce these. It seems that some of the later productions might have them. Like, looking at the grammar, I find that NT32 -> 't75', so NT32 produces t75. Similarly, NT30 -> 't63', but that's not 69. Wait, maybe other combinations.\n\nWait, the grammar has more complex productions. For example, NT15 has several productions to t35, t28, etc. Let me look for NTs that produce t69.\n\nWait, from the grammar, I see that:\n\n- NT31 -> 't69' (e.g., NT31 -> 't69')\n- NT33 -> 't52'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT24 -> 't12', etc.\n\nSo NT31 can produce t69. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT33 -> 't52' is written, but also NT31 -> 't35' and 't22'. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the NTs that produce t's.\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see that there are several entries where NTs directly produce t's like 't75', 't69', etc. For example, NT32 -> 't75'. So if NT32 can become 't75', then I need another NT that can produce the rest.\n\nThe string is `t75 t69 t69`. So the first symbol is t75, which comes from NT32. Now, looking at the productions:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32 (from S-> NT32 NT32). But wait, the string is `t75 t69 t69`, which is three symbols. Let me see how the grammar can produce three symbols starting with t75.\n\nWait, the first production rule for S is S -> NT32 NT14, and another S -> NT18 NT32. Hmm, so each production for S includes two NTs. So the start symbol S can only produce two tokens at a time, right? Because each production is two NTs. So the string `t75 t69 t69` has three symbols, which suggests that it's from a derivation that starts with S and then another S in a way that makes three symbols.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the parse might happen. Let's assume S generates two NTs, so the start would produce two symbols. But our string is three, which must come from some other production. Wait, but in the given grammar, S only has the two initial productions: S-> NT32 NT32 and S-> NT18 NT32. Wait, no, looking back, the initial grammar is:\n\nThe user listed the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, that seems a bit unclear because usually in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two tokens on the right, either two NTs or a terminal and an NT. But looking back, I think the initial structure was perhaps a bit messed up. Let me recount:\n\nThe grammar starts as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, no, that seems like two productions for S, each producing two NTs.\n\nBut the string is `t75 t69 t69`, which is three symbols. So for S to produce three symbols, one of the productions for S must produce more than two NTs, but according to the given grammar, each production for S is two NTs, which would produce two symbols.\n\nHmm, that might be a problem. Because if all productions for S start with S-> ... NT NT, then each S production would contribute exactly two symbols, so the entire string generated would have an even number of symbols. But our string has three, which is odd. So unless I'm missing something, this could indicate that the string is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can derive zero symbols through some other productions, but usually, the start symbol must derive a sequence of terminal symbols. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, the right-hand side must be two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. So the start symbol can only generate strings of length equal to some power of 2, depending on the structure.\n\nWait, but in this case, looking at the given grammar, the first production for S is S -> NT32 NT32, which would produce two non-terminals, each of which can in turn produce more non-terminals or terminals. So each S production can lead to a chain of NTs, each replacing another, and the final terminals would be expanded step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The string has three symbols, so for the grammar to produce it, there must be a way to derive three terminals from S in two steps. But Chomsky Normal Form typically allows each step to replace a single NT with two NTs or a terminal, so the number of symbols can increase, but the process is such that each step can add two symbols, leading to a string length that's an exponential of the number of steps. But to get three symbols, perhaps the initial production leads to two non-terminals, each of which then leads to one or two symbols.\n\nWait, let's try to see:\n\nSuppose S -> NT32 NT32.\n\nThen each NT32 can be expanded. Let's say NT32 can be replaced by a terminal. If both NT32s expand to a single terminal each, then the string would be two symbols, which is not the case. So maybe one of the NT32s expands into more symbols. Let's see if NT32 can produce 't75' and somehow another symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not considering the correct production rules. Wait, looking back, I see that there's a production NT32 -> 't75' according to the grammar. So NT32 can produce 't75'. So if S-> NT32 NT32, then perhaps the first NT32 becomes 't75', and the second becomes something else. Let's see.\n\nWait, but S-> NT32 NT14 is another production for S. Wait, no, in the initial grammar given, I think it's:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nBut in the detailed list, the user listed S -> NT32 NT32 and S-> NT18 NT32, so that must be the correct initial productions.\n\nWait, if S can only produce two NTs, then the entire derivation can only produce strings with an even number of symbols, because each NT contributes at least one symbol, but perhaps two. Wait, but no, because NTs can expand into more symbols. So the string length isn't strictly determined by initial productions but by how the NTs can be expanded.\n\nWait, but in this case, our target string is `t75 t69 t69`, which is three symbols. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nFirst, since S can only start with either S-> NT32 NT32 or S-> NT18 NT32, let's explore the first possibility: S-> NT32 NT32. Then each of these NT32s can be rewritten. The first NT32 can become 't75', as per the grammar. So the first symbol is 't75'. Now, the second NT32 can be rewritten. Looking at the grammar, NT32 can produce 't75' directly, but if we need 't69', maybe NT32 can be rewritten into 't75' and then somehow the other NT32 can split into another 't69' and something else? Hmm, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider if S-> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string `t75 t72 t69 t69` is generated by the given grammar. First, I need to look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a few rules. For instance, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Also, there are start symbols being transformed into other non-terminals and eventually terminals like 't' followed by numbers. The problem is the string starts with `t75`, so I should check if any of these terminals are connected to the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by examining which non-terminals can produce 't75'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, if I have NT32, it can produce 't75'. Now, looking at how NT32 is derived, in the grammar, NT32 has a production rule: NT32 \u2192 NT72 NT15. So, NT32 is a combination of NT72 and NT15.\n\nNow, checking NT72: it produces 't72', and NT15 has several options, including 't71', 't35', and another option for NT23 which produces 't34' and 't1'. Wait, NT15 also has a production to 't68' when connected with NT19, but that's part of the 15 rule. Also, looking at rule NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34 and NT21 produces 't69' and NT34 produces 't12'. Hmm, that might be useful later.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t75`, so that would come from NT32. Then, the next token is `t72`, which comes from NT72. Next is `t69` from NT21 and another `t69` from NT21. So the string is t75 t72 t69 t69.\n\nLet me see how these tokens can be chained together. \n\nStarting from S:\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14 (since S has multiple rules, but this one gives 't75'). So, NT32 needs to produce 't75', as I said, which is possible because NT32 \u2192 't75' directly? Wait, no. Looking again, the rule is NT32 \u2192 't75', yes. So NT32 produces 't75'.\n\nThen, the next token is 't72'. Looking at where 't72' comes from. 't72' is produced by NT72, which comes from NT32 \u2192 NT72 NT15. So, in our earlier step, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so the second part is NT14. Wait, but in this case, to get 't72', we must have a chain where NT32 is split into NT72 and NT15. So S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and NT32 \u2192 NT72 NT15. Then, the next non-terminal is NT14, which would produce 't74', but wait, the string has 't72' next.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Because if NT14 is used, it produces 't74', but in the string, the next token after 't75' is 't72'. So maybe I'm on the wrong branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S uses a different production. Let's consider S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then, NT18 \u2192 't74' and NT32 \u2192 't75'. So that would give t74 t75, but the string starts with t75 t72. So this production isn't helpful.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Let me think... Maybe the S can be derived into other paths. Wait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, the string is four tokens. Let's see if there is a production that can generate four terminals in a row.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most non-terminals produce two non-terminals, except some produce terminals. For example, NT32 can produce 't75', so a single terminal. Similarly, NT72 can produce 't72', so maybe the chain is NT32 \u2192 't75', NT72 \u2192 't72', NT21 \u2192 't69', and NT21 \u2192 't69' again.\n\nBut the question is, how do these non-terminals combine in the grammar to form the string t75 t72 t69 t69.\n\nLooking at the initial production, we have S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, if NT32 is producing 't75' and NT14 is producing 't74', that's only two tokens, which doesn't match the string. So perhaps that's not the right branch.\n\nAlternatively, S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then, NT18 produces 't74' and NT32 produces 't75', giving two tokens again, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking at other rules, there are also production rules that produce multiple non-terminals which result in terminals. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15. So, if a non-terminal is split into two, each producing a terminal, it would result in two terminals in one step.\n\nSo perhaps, in the derivation, it's possible to have multiple steps combining to produce the required string.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t75, t72, t69, t69. So four terminals.\n\nWe need to see if these can be generated from S by some sequence of productions.\n\nFirst token is t75. That's produced by NT32 \u2192 't75'.\n\nSecond token is t72. Looking at where t72 can come from. 't72' is produced by NT72, which is derived from NT32 \u2192 NT72 NT15.\n\nSo, if we have S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and the NT32 is split into NT72 and NT15, then the derivation would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 (NT72 NT15) NT14 \u2192 NT72 NT15 NT14.\n\nNow, from NT15, looking at the rule: NT15 \u2192 't71' or 't35' or 't68' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT15 has multiple options, including NT21 NT34 and others. Wait, let's re-examine the grammar for NT15.)\n\nLooking back, yes, it's listed as:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n\nNT21 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, but that would produce t69 t12. Hmm, but that's not what we need.\n\nAlternatively, another production for NT15 is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't19' NT23 and other options, like 't15'?\n\nWait, the grammar shows:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't19' 't28'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nIn the given grammar, there are multiple rules, but for example:\n\nLooking at NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT1, and others. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking for NT15, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n\nNT21 \u2192 't69'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't12'\n\nSo NT15 can produce t69 t12, but that's not helpful for our string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rules. Maybe NT15 can produce other combinations. Let's check all rules for NT15.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT15 has the following rules (simplified):\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't19' NT23\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT29 NT20\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT19 NT30\n\nWait, no. Looking carefully in the provided grammar, the rule for NT15 is:\n\nNT15 -> 't19' NT23 , then 't28' (Wait, no, perhaps I missed some.

{"custom_id":"request-36","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this question where I need to determine whether the string `t75 t12 t69 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means all the production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the rules are non-terminals broken down into two other non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then NT32 goes to NT2 NT22, and NT25 goes to NT6 NT5, etc. However, towards the end, I see some non-terminals directly mapped to terminals. For instance, certain NT rules produce 't' followed by a number. \n\nThe string we need to check is `t75 t12 t69 t69`. So each token in the string corresponds to a terminal produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should see if each 't' followed by a number is present in the grammar. Let's check each part:\n\n- t75: Looking through the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 t75. So 't75' is directly produced.\n- t12: Looking for 't12', I see NT27 \u2192 t77 and NT30 \u2192 t63. Hmm, that's not 12. Wait, NT24 \u2192 NT24 nt12? Wait no, let me check. Actually, in the rules, I see NT34 \u2192 t12. Oh, yes, NT34 \u2192 t12. So 't12' is produced by NT34.\n- t69: Looking for 't69', I see NT31 \u2192 t69. So that's straightforward.\n- t69 again, so same as before.\n\nNow, the string starts with t75, followed by t12, then t69 twice. \n\nSo to generate this string, the grammar must have a derivation where these non-terminals produce in sequence. So let's see if the start symbol S can produce a sequence that includes these terms.\n\nLooking at S's rules, S can go to NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. \n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then NT32 \u2192 t75, so that would give us 't75'. Then NT14 can go to 't43' because S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but wait, looking at the rules again, I see:\n\nWait, S has rules like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So NT14: Let's check NT14's production. Looking through the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 NT28 NT22. No, wait, NT14 has a rule: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21? Let me check all NT14 rules. Oh, I don't see an NT14 \u2192 't43' directly. Wait, looking again, I see NT15 produces t43? No, wait, in the rules, NT14 doesn't directly map to a terminal. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT14 mapped to a terminal. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for NT14, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 't43'. But not NT14. Hmm. So maybe the initial step is S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So if S starts with NT18, let's see if NT18 can produce something. Looking for NT18 rules: I see NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22, and NT18 is a non-terminal. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see the entire chain.\n\nLet me start by trying to see if the string can be derived.\n\nThe string is t75, t12, t69, t69.\n\nSo the first token is t75, which comes from NT32 \u2192 t75. So the first non-terminal in the derivation must be NT32. So that means S must produce NT32 NT14, because S's other option is NT18 NT32, but if the first token is t75, that's from NT32. So maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then the next step would be to derive NT14.\n\nBut wait, NT14's rules. Looking at the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So NT14 can't produce a terminal directly. So that's a problem because the next token is t12, which is a terminal.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but then NT14 can't directly produce t12. Alternatively, perhaps there's another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that several non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t75\n- NT34 \u2192 t12\n- NT31 \u2192 t69\n- NT24 \u2192 t77? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT31 -> NT9 NT11.\n\nBut I also see that NT31 can go to 't69' because there's a rule NT31 \u2192 t69. So that's a direct production.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 \u2192 t12.\n\nWait, so let me correct that.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look for all the rules that directly map a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t75 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, I think I misread them. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I think I might have misread which rules are terminals and which are non-terminals. Let me list them:\n\nLooking through the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT29 \u2192 t28.\n\nWait, no, let me check each line carefully.\n\nWait, the rules are written as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nand so on for other S rules.\n\nThen, looking further down, I see:\n\nNT24 -> t77? Wait, let me go through each rule.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 't1'\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 't53'\n\nND10 \u2192 't42'\n\nAnd so on.

{"custom_id":"request-53","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t75 t28 t28 t69 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the grammar looks like.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol. Here, the start symbol seems to be S because the first productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nBut wait, looking deeper, many of the non-terminals are ending up producing terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers. So it seems like the grammar is actually producing a sequence of these terminals, so the actual language is a collection of terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is `t75 t28 t28 t69 t69`. So I need to see if each of these can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Let me map each of these tokens to their possible sources.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that each production eventually reduces to a terminal 't' followed by some digits. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT14 \u2192 't43', etc.\n\nFirst, let's look at each 't' in the string and see how they could be generated.\n\n1. t75: Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT32 \u2192 't75'. So that's a direct production.\n\n2. t28: I need to find which NT produces 't28'. Looking through the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't11' and NT8 \u2192 't46' might not help. Wait, let's check NT8: It has a production NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10. Also, NT10 has NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT5, and NT5 has multiple options. Hmm, perhaps NT28 \u2192 't28', since there's a production NT28 \u2192 't28'? Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, let me look again. The grammar has NT28 \u2192 't82' and others, but I don't see an exact 't28' production. Wait, looking again, I see that NT29 \u2192 't62', NT31 \u2192 't35', so maybe I'm not seeing directly 't28'. Alternatively, perhaps NT22 \u2192 't3' and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal 't28' appears in NT28 \u2192 't82', but I don't see a production for NT28 \u2192 't28'. Wait, let me check if any non-terminals have a direct production of 't28'. I see NT25 \u2192 't64', NT24 \u2192 't42', etc. Hmm, actually, there's no NT directly producing 't28', which might be a problem because the string has two 't28's.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look for a production that ends in 't28'. Scanning through, I don't see any NT directly producing 't28'. Therefore, it's likely that 't28' is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would mean the string can't be generated because we don't have a production for 't28'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the NT28 \u2192 't82' isn't the only option. Let me re-examine the production rules for NT28. The grammar shows:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28\nNT24 -> NT4 NT1\n...\nWait, that's not correct. Let me check the full list.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT28, the relevant parts are:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28\n... some other rules ...\nAlso, there are a few other rules, like NT28 -> NT25 NT10 or something else? Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, there's a line NT28 -> NT28 NT28 and others, but also lines such as NT28 -> NT21 NT25 and NT14 -> NT31 NT21, etc. But I don't see a production where NT28 directly converts to 't28'. Instead, NT28 is being used in other non-terminals and terminals. So unless there's an indirect way, but even then, the string has 't28's and if we don't have any NT that produce it, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing a production for NT28 that leads to 't28'. Let me go through the rules again. Scanning through all lines, the only 't's I see are specific to certain N terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1', NT23 \u2192 't34', NT1 \u2192 't6', etc. So 't28' as a terminal doesn't appear in any production on the RHS of any NT production.\n\nTherefore, the string has 't28', 't28', 't69', 't69'. But since none of the non-terminals directly produce 't28', the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Thus, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I don't have a mistake. Perhaps I missed a production. Let me scan through the grammar again. Looking for any NT that directly produce 't28':\n\nLooking through all lines, the only terminals are for numbers like 1, 3, 4, 5, etc., but none seem to be 't28'.

{"custom_id":"request-56","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t75 t49 t26 t15 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar. This grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of productions. Let me start by simplifying the string into components: t75, t49, t26, t15, t69. These look like terminal symbols based on the grammar rules. My job is to see if these terminals can be derived through the productions.\n\nFirst, I'll try to work backward from the terminals. Each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal production in the grammar. The key is to find a derivation path that leads to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string has five terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production body can only have two symbols. That means each step in the derivation tree will have a node splitting into two children. The length of the string should be 2^n -1 for some n, but here it's five, which is 2^3 -1=7 is too big, so 3 steps? Not sure; maybe it's okay.\n\nLet me try to find the root. The start symbol is S, which has two productions from the top: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So each production starts S as two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t75. Let's check what production in the grammar leads to t75. Scanning the rules, I see NT32 has a production like NT32 \u2192 t75. Checking the rules, in NT14's productions, under NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, and NT31 has t35, which isn't 75. Alternatively, looking at NT32, I think NT32 can produce t75 directly because in the rules, NT32 is present in the productions of NT14 and others, and I see that in the end, NT32 \u2192 t75. Wait, no, looking at the end of the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot:\n\nNT32 -> t75 (from the end of the rules, perhaps). Let me scan the list.\n\nYes, towards the end, there is `NT32 -> t75`. So ST32 can produce 't75'.\n\nSo the first part of the string, 't75', must come from NT32, so the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, from NT32 we get t75, so that's resolved.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is t49, t26, t15, t69. These come from NT14. Let me look at the productions for NT14.\n\nIn the rules, NT14's productions:\n- NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21\n- NT14 \u2192 t43\n\nWait, so 't43' is one of the options, and the second part of the string starts with 't49', which isn't 43. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, no, the string is t75 t49 t26 t15 t69. So 't49' is the next. Maybe 't49' comes from NT32 elsewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first two steps are S \u2192 NT32 NT14, leading to t75 from NT32, and then NT14 needs to produce a sequence that leads to t49, t26, t15, t69.\n\nWait, perhaps the sequence is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and then NT14 is further split.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions, there's a production: NT14 \u2192 t43, which is a terminal. So if 't43' is expected, but in our string next is 't49', that doesn't fit. So maybe the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps 't75' is a terminal, as per NT32 producing 't75'. So that would mean that S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and NT32 produces t75. Then, NT14 needs to produce the rest: t49, t26, t15, t69.\n\nWait, but NT14's productions are either NT31 NT21 or t43. So how can it produce multiple terminals?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the string is longer, so I should consider the entire structure step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a result of a series of substitutions starting from S.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider the string as t75 t49 t26 t15 t69. Each terminal corresponds to a specific non-terminal production.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- 't75' comes from NT32. So the first part is NT32, which is derived from S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, the second symbol is 't49'. Let's see where 't49' comes from. Looking through the grammar, maybe NT0 \u2192 t49, or ND24 \u2192 t49? Let me scan the rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see a production `NT24 -> t42`, `NT24 -> t75`, but 't49' is a direct production. Wait, looking at the end:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n`NT24 -> t42` is one production, but I don't see 't49' directly. However, looking at NT15's productions:\n\nNT15 has several options, such as `NT15 -> t15`, but in the string, I'm seeing 't15' later. Hmm, maybe 't49' is from NT19.\n\nLooking at NT19's productions, I see `NT19 -> t1`. No, that's 't1'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps 't49' is from NT7, since NT7 \u2192 't1', but not sure. Alternatively, maybe 't49' is from NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each terminal to its respective non-terminal. Let me make a list:\n\nt75: NT32\nt49: ?\nt26: ?\nt15: ?\nt69: ?\n\nLooking for 't49', I don't immediately see any production that leads directly to it. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar rules to find where 't49' comes from.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- I see NT24: NT24 \u2192 t49? Wait, is there a NT24 production that includes 't49'? Let me scan:\n\nYes, I see: `NT24 -> t49` is a production. So 't49' comes from NT24.\n\nSo, 't49' is from NT24. Now, to get NT24 as a non-terminal, I need to look at its productions. So, looking at the grammar rules for NT24:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT17 NT25 or other options?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nLooking back at the grammar rules, the NT24 productions include:\n\nNT24 -> t49. So 't49' is a terminal that directly comes from NT24. So in the parse, we'd have NT24 producing t49.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT32 NT14, NT32 \u2192 t75, then NT14 needs to produce the remaining symbols: t49, t26, t15, t69. But wait, that's four symbols, but from the start, the entire string is five terminals. But since each internal node in CNF splits into two, the number of symbols is 2^n. Hmm, but five isn't a power of two minus one. So maybe this indicates a problem, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string isn't S-derived but comes from another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step.\n\nWait, maybe 't49' is a wrong approach. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet's think about the string as a sequence of t75, t49, t26, t15, t69. Let's try to represent this as a parse tree where each parent has exactly two children, and each is either a terminal or a production.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is the root. Let's try to split the string accordingly.\n\nThe string has length 5. Let's split it into two parts at each step.\n\nOne approach is to try to see if the string can be divided into two parts that are both valid, each starting with a production of S.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to represent the string as a parenthesized structure, but since this isn't standard, perhaps a recursive descent approach.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think recursively.\n\nLet me see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-79","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t75 t49 t43 t19 t3 t69` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several production rules. It looks a bit complex, but I notice that the non-terminals are the capital letters like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and the terminals are various 't' followed by numbers. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC, except for the terminals, which are simple. \n\nThe string we're given is a sequence of terminals: t75, t49, t43, t19, t3, t69. So, the task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet me list the production rules that result in 't' strings:\n\nLooking through the rules, for each NT, there are rules that produce 't' followed by some number. For example:\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t40\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT2 -> t28\n- And so on for each NT.\n\nEach of these rules directly generates a single 't' token. So, to build the string, each 't' must come from one of these production rules.\n\nThe string is six 't's. So, each step must produce one 't' and the rest would need to be handled appropriately. But wait, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A -> BC, but in this case, some rules are A -> t followed by a number, which actually aren't CNF because CNF requires all productions to produce two non-terminals, except for the start symbol.\n\nWait, no, that's a mistake. In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, some production rules have two terminals on the right side, like S -> NT32 NT14, which are terminal productions. So, the grammar seems to have both two-terminals and non-terminals on the right side, which might not be strictly CNF.\n\nBut the user said it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Wait, no, that's not correct. Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So any production with a terminal on the right would not be in CNF. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the grammar includes both forms, which would make it not in CNF anymore.\n\nBut since the user provided it as a Chomsky Normal Form, perhaps I should proceed under that assumption, but perhaps the production rules do include terminals, so maybe it's not CNF as defined. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user just made a mistake in the format. Let me try to see if any of the rules have terminals in more than one production. Wait, looking back, the initial rules start with S -> NT32 NT14, which are both non-terminals. Then, other rules like NT3 -> t1. So, some rules produce terminals, others produce non-terminals. That suggests the grammar isn't in proper CNF, but perhaps it's still in a form that can be handled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended, and the grammar is not CNF as the user said, but the initial statements were incorrect. Perhaps the grammar is in a form that allows both possibilities, and the problem is still solvable.\n\nGiven that, let's approach it as if it's an arbitrary context-free grammar, not specifically in CNF. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, we can simulate the parsing process or use the CYK algorithm, but perhaps a simpler approach is to trace backward from the string.\n\nSo, the string is t75 t49 t43 t19 t3 t69.\n\nWe need to see if each 't' can be generated by a production rule. Since each 't' is a terminal, each must come from a production rule that directly replaces a non-terminal with that single terminal.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's find which non-terminals generate each 't':\n\n- t75 comes from NT2 (from NT2 -> t75)\n- t49 comes from NT1 (from NT1 -> t49)\n- t43 comes from NT7 (from NT7 -> t43)\n- t19 comes from NT23 (from NT23 -> t19)\n- t3 comes from NT22 (from NT22 -> t3)\n- t69 comes from NT31 (from NT31 -> t69)\n\nSo, each 't' in the string comes from specific non-terminals. Now, to form the entire string, the non-terminals corresponding to these tokens must be rewritten in a way that, when combined, generate the sequence.\n\nBut the challenge is that each non-terminal can only produce two non-terminals at a time (since CNF productions are A \u2192 BC). So, each step involves combining two non-terminals into a terminal or another combination.\n\nWait, but in this case, each 't' is a direct production, so each 't' is one step. However, since the entire string is a sequence of six 't's, we have to have a derivation where each 't' is generated in a way that they appear in order.\n\nWait, but in a context-free grammar, the derivation tree must produce the entire string at the same time. So, the string is generated by the entire left-hand side of the main production.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol is S, which is defined as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the start is S, which produces two non-terminals.\n\nEach of these NT32 or NT18 can further produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce more non-terminals until a terminal is reached.\n\nBut to have a string of six terminals, we have to see if it's possible to derive such a string through leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that each 't' is generated by a non-terminal, and each production of those non-terminals must form a proper tree that results in the string.\n\nWait, but each 't' requires its own production rule, meaning that each 't' is a single production. So, for the string to be generated, the entire string must be built by successively applying the productions for each 't', but since it's a context-free grammar, the application must be in a tree structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 't' is produced by a different path in the grammar, and the problem is to see if the sequence of 't's can be built by connecting their production paths.\n\nBut this seems a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to see if each 't' can be reached through the production rules, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me attempt to build the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S can produce either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's assume we take the first option: NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, NT32 must derive to the first 't' in the string, which is t75. Looking at the production for NT32, which is not listed as a terminal production. Wait, in the rules, looking for NT32:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT32 except for the original S productions. Wait, in the given rules, is there any rule that includes NT32 except as part of the start symbol? Let me check.\n\nGoing through the list, I don't see NT32 being rewritten. So, NT32 probably must be derived into more non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. So, let's proceed.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 is part of the start production S -> NT32 NT14. So, each of these non-terminals must derive into a chain that ends with a 't'.\n\nLooking at NT32, since there are no rules that directly produce a single terminal, we need to find a path from NT32 to a terminal. Wait, but if NT32 can't produce a terminal directly, perhaps it must produce two non-terminals, which in turn produce other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSimilarly, for NT14, which is part of S -> NT32 NT14, and in the given rules, NT14 can produce NT31 NT23 (from NT14 -> NT31 NT23), and NT31 can produce 't69' and further down.\n\nBut wait, looking back, the rules start with S and have rules that split into various non-terminals, each of which may eventually lead to a terminal 't' with a specific number.\n\nBut for our case, the string starts with t75, so I need to find a path from NT32 to t75.\n\nLooking for rules that have NT32 as a left-hand side. From the given rules, I don't see any NT32 -> something except that S is produced from NT32.

{"custom_id":"request-72","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t75 t53 t3 t40 t3 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step because it looks a bit complex with all those productions.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, the grammar consists of either terminals or non-terminals expanding into two other non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example, NT31 -> 't9' and so on. Wait, but in the provided grammar, some non-terminals are connected to terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't71', NT5 -> 't68', etc. So, some of the leaves in the parse tree will be terminals like 't75', 't53', etc.\n\nThe string we have is `t75 t53 t3 t40 t3 t69`. Each of these is a terminal, so they need to be generated directly or through some production.\n\nLet me look at the string and see which non-terminals could produce these terminals.\n\nStarting from the first token, 't75'. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces 't75'? Let me scan through the productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see NT23 -> 't34', but I don't see 't75' directly. Wait, maybe through multiple steps. Let me check if any non-terminal expands to 't75'.\n\nWait, wait, I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT30 NT32. Let me see what NT30 and NT32 can produce.\n\nWait, let me find where 't75' appears. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT31 -> 't69' and NT3 -> 't71'. Hmm, not 't75' yet.\n\nWait, maybe looking at which non-terminals can produce 't75'. Let's see. In the grammar, do any NTs produce 't75'?\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see 't75' as a terminal in the given grammar. All the productions either have two non-terminals on the right or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nWait a second, in the provided grammar, is 't75' a terminal or a non-terminal? Because in the list, the right-hand sides of productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in the given string, the elements are all terminals.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I see some entries where the production results in a terminal. For example, NT3 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't1', etc. But I don't see any production that ends with 't75'. So maybe 't75' is a non-terminal that can be expanded further.\n\nWait, in the grammar, let's see if 't75' appears on the left-hand side as a non-terminal? No, because all non-terminals are NTs, and the productions start with S and NTs. The NTs sometimes produce terminals, but 't75' is not a non-terminal because it doesn't appear on the left side of any production; all productions either start with S or NTs and have two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right.\n\nWait, but looking through all productions, none have 't75' on the left side. So 't75' must be a terminal symbol, which would mean it's a terminal. But I thought 't75' isn't a production on the right side of any NT. So, does that mean 't75' is a terminal?\n\nHmm, that complicates things because if 't75' is a terminal, then the corresponding production rule in the grammar must be S -> 't75' something. But I don't see that. The productions start with S -> NT30 NT32, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the 't75' is an expansion of a non-terminal? Let me see. Looking for NT that can produce 't75' through a production.\n\nLooking through the productions, none have a terminal as 't75' on the right-hand side. The right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a non-terminal followed by a terminal or two terminals.\n\nWait, maybe in some production, 't75' is a part of NT30 or NT32.\n\nWait, looking for where NT30 or NT32 can be expanded:\n\n- NT30 -> NT2 NT22\n\n- NT32 -> ...? Let me check: the productions, I don't see NT32 in the provided list beyond the initial line. Wait, looking at the user-provided grammar, S -> NT30 NT32, but further down, they list NT30 productions but not NT32 beyond that. Let me check:\n\nThe initial grammar is:\n\nS -> NT30 NT32\n\nThen,\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\n\nBut looking further, the productions include NT31 -> 't40' and other terminals, but not NT32 beyond that. Wait, in the grammar provided, NT32 is only mentioned in the initial production, but not expanded further. So perhaps NT32 is a non-terminal that can produce another non-terminal, which then produces a terminal, or maybe it's a terminal itself.\n\nWait, I think I may have misunderstood. All the production rules in the grammar are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. So, for example, NT30 -> NT3 NT30, but the left-hand side is always a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nSo, in the string `t75 t53 t3 t40 t3 t69`, each element is a terminal. That means that each of these must be produced directly by some NT or perhaps a non-terminal that can be further expanded to produce them.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't75' directly. Let's go through each NT's productions.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30\n\n- NT32 -> ?\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT30 NT32, but then NT32 is only used elsewhere but not further defined. Wait, looking in the list, after S, we have NT30 -> NT3 NT30, but NT32 is used in S, but in the list, I don't see NT32 being expanded. Wait, perhaps in the given grammar, NT32 is expanded into something else? Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the user-provided grammar list starts with S -> NT30 NT32, followed by other productions. So, NT32 isn't listed with any expansion, which would mean it's a terminal. Therefore, 't75' could be part of NT32's production, but since NT32 isn't expanded, it must be a terminal. But then, in that case, S's production is NT30 NT32, which would produce two terminals and NT30 and NT32.\n\nWait, no, S -> NT30 NT32 would mean NT30 is a non-terminal, and NT32 is either a non-terminal or a terminal. If NT32 is a non-terminal and can derive some NT31 NT32 or similar, then that would create more non-terminals.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSince the string consists of terminals, each of these must be produced by some NT. So, for 't75' to be in the string, there must be an NT that can derive 't75', perhaps directly or through a chain of productions.\n\nBut looking through all the NT productions, I don't see any production that generates 't75'. So, perhaps the answer is 'No' because none of the NTs can derive 't75' as a terminal.\n\nBut wait, maybe the NTs can derive sequences that include 't75' indirectly. For example, if 't75' is part of a larger expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NTs can be part of a chain that produces these terminals, but since 't75' isn't generated by any NT, the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me check all NTs and their possible productions to see if any can derive 't75'.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30: so it's a chain that can keep expanding, but it would eventually need to terminate, possibly through a symbol leading to a terminal.\n\nBut I don't see NT30 leading to 't75'.\n\n- NT32: in the grammar, S -> NT30 NT32, but I don't see NT32 being expanded beyond that. So perhaps NT32 is a terminal, meaning 't75' is a terminal if it's part of NT32.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't75', which would need to be a terminal produced by NT32.

{"custom_id":"request-100","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is \"t75 t40 t75 t59 t68 t69\". The grammar has a bunch of production rules with NT symbols on the left and combinations of NTs and 't' strings on the right. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what this grammar is producing. Since it's in CNF, each production is either a single symbol on both sides or two non-terminals on each side. But looking at the provided rules, each production on the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals. The end symbols (the ones starting with 't') are the actual terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the string into its tokens. Each token is either a 't' followed by a number or an NT. The string is \"t75 t40 t75 t59 t68 t69\", which is six tokens: t75, t40, t75, t59, t68, t69.\n\nNow, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar's start symbol S. The grammar has two initial productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. These produce the start string either as NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nSo, the string starts with t75. Let's see what NT75 corresponds to. Looking through the production rules, any NT that produces t75 is the one where the RHS leads to t75. Scanning the rules, I see that NT32 \u2192 t75. So, if the first NT symbol in the string is NT32, then the first token t75 is accounted for.\n\nNow, the second token is t40. Let me check the productions that produce t40. Looking through the rules, NT7 appears to produce t40. Wait, looking again, the rule is NT7 \u2192 t40. So, if the second NT is NT7, then t40 is produced.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. The grammar's rule for NT7 is: NT7 \u2192 t1. Hmm, that doesn't give t40. Wait, no, I might have looked at the wrong ones. Looking again, perhaps I missed a rule. Let me scan more carefully.\n\nI see that:\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\n- NT19 \u2192 t1\n- NT28 \u2192 t82\n- NT23 \u2192 t21\n- NT29 \u2192 t28\n- NT24 \u2192 t33, etc.\n\nWait, but the rule for NT7 was actually under NT20: NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7. Wait no, looking back:\n\nIn the list of productions, under NT20, it's:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n\nAnd for NT12, it's:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nWait, but in the rules, looking for 't40', I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t40\n\nSo, for the second token to be t40, the second NT must be NT0.\n\nSo, the first part is NT32 NT75. Wait, no, the first NT is NT32 because t75 is from NT32. So the first step is S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, starting string is NT32\u2192t75 and NT14\u2192? Looking at the productions for NT14: NT14 \u2192 t43 and NT32 \u2192 t75.\n\nWait, no. NT14's production rules are:\n\nLooking through the rules for NT14:\n\nI see NT14 \u2192 t43 and NT14 \u2192 t68. Wait, looking again, in the rules provided, there are two rules for NT14:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT3 NT23, NT14 \u2192 t43, and NT14 \u2192 t68. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let me parse this correctly. Looking back, the rules are:\n\nNT14: S has S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which is an initial production. Then, NT14 appears in some rules as the LHS. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT14 \u2192 t43\nNT14 \u2192 t68\n\nSo, NT14 can produce t43 or t68 as a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, in the string, after t75, the next is t40. But in the initial step, when S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the RHS would be NT32 and NT14. So, NT32 produces t75, NT14 produces either t43 or t68. But our string has t40 as the second token, which is not t43 or t68. So, this path seems impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's explore that.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then NT18 produces the second token t40, and NT32 produces the first token t75.\n\nLooking at NT18's productions: in the given rules, does any rule produce NT18 as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t74\n\nSo, NT18 can produce t74. But in the string, the second token is t40, which is not t74. So that also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. I need to make sure that for each NT in the string, it can produce the corresponding token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the string is longer than what can be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me re-express the production steps.\n\nWait, the string is t75 t40 t75 t59 t68 t69.\n\nSo, the sequence is six tokens: t75, t40, t75, t59, t68, t69.\n\nEach of these must correspond to the NT symbols in the grammar productions.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 (producing t75 and then NT14's symbol). Or S \u2192 NT18 NT32 (producing t40 [from NT18] and t75 [from NT32]).\n\nWait, but the first token is t75, which comes from NT32. So if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the first token is t75, and the second token (t40) would come from NT14. Looking at NT14's productions: NT14 can produce t43 or t68. But the second token is t40, which is not among these, so this path doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which would produce the first token as NT18 \u2192 t74, which doesn't match the actual string's first token t75. So that path also doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe the first token t75 is from a different path. Looking through the rules, the only NT that directly produces t75 is NT32 because in the rules, NT32 \u2192 t75 is directly specified.\n\nSo, the first NT must be NT32, and the second NT must be something that produces t40, but in the initial production of S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the second NT is NT14, which only produces t43 or t68, neither of which is t40.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has rules that allow for multiple pathways. Perhaps I need to consider that after the initial production, the NTs can generate other tokens through their own rules.\n\nWait, no, because the string is a linear production, each NT in the sequence must generate exactly one token or other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible that there's a chain of productions that generate multiple tokens.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the string is a sequence of tokens that can be derived through a series of lookaheads and reductions.\n\nBut given that the string is just six tokens, it's more efficient to try to parse it step by step.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT32 NT14:\n\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nThis would produce tokens corresponding to NT32 and NT14. So, the first token is t75 (from NT32), and the second token is either t43 or t68 (from NT14). But the string's second token is t40, which doesn't match either. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production is the other one: S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32, so the first token would be from NT18, which in the rules is NT18 \u2192 t74.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t75 t12 t74 t65 t28 t69 t69` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, typically each rule has two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the provided grammar. It's pretty extensive, with many non-terminals and productions. Some of the non-terminals seem to be terminals now, as they have productions that go to 't' followed by numbers, like `NT14 -> 't71'`, etc. So the end of the grammar maps some non-terminals directly to terminal strings.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of seven tokens starting with `t75` and ending with `t69`. My goal is to see if this sequence can result from applying the productions of the grammar starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's initial rule, S can produce either `NT32 NT32` or `NT18 NT32`. Wait, actually, no. Let me check again. The grammar starts with S -> NT32 NT32 or S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, wait, no, checking the grammar again: It says S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, that doesn't look right. Wait, no, looking back: S -> NT32 NT32? No, looking again, I see S -> NT32 NT32, and S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me look more carefully.\n\nThe grammar for S is:\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, that can't be right because NT18 might not be present in the productions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the initial productions under S are:\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, that seems odd because NT18 isn't listed as a non-terminal in the grammar's rules. Or maybe I missed it. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT18 as a non-terminal. So that might be a mistake, but perhaps it's a typo in the question. Alternatively, maybe the NT32 is the key here.\n\nWait, for the provided string, the first token is `t75`. Looking back, in the grammar, NT30 -> NT3 NT30, and NT3 -> 't1'. So if we have NT3 producing 't1', then perhaps this is part of a chain.\n\nWait, in the initial production S -> NT32 NT32, so S produces two copies of NT32. If NT32 can derive a terminal, that might be part of the string.\n\nLooking for NT32's productions: I don't see any NT32 rules other than they might be terminals. Wait, in the end of the grammar, NT32 is assigned to various 't' tokens, like NT32 -> 't75', 't12', etc. So NT32 can produce different terminal strings based on the productions. So for example, NT32 can go to 't75', 't12', etc.\n\nIf S -> NT32 NT32, then each NT32 can produce a terminal. So the first step is S => NT32 ND32. From there, each NT32 needs to produce a terminal string. So if the first token is `t75`, that could come from NT32, and the next token might come from the second NT32.\n\nWait, but the string we need is `t75 t12 t74 t65 t28 t69 t69`. That's seven tokens. So if S produces two NT32s, each producing a single terminal, that's only two tokens. So that doesn't match. Therefore, perhaps S must produce something more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S produces other combinations. Looking back, maybe I misread the initial rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking closely, the initial rules under S are:\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, but earlier the NT32 is present as a non-terminal; perhaps I made a mistake in the initial grammar. Wait, the user provided the entire grammar in a list. Let me scan through the grammar for S.\n\nLooking through, the initial S productions are indeed S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, but in the end of the grammar, NT18 is mapped to 't74' and 't69' etc. So perhaps the initial S production S -> NT18 NT32 is valid.\n\nWait, but earlier in the grammar, under NT13's production, I see NT13 -> 't33', 't28', etc. Hmm, but going back to S's initial rule, perhaps I should start by expanding S.\n\nSo let's take S -> NT18 NT32 as the first option. Then NT18 and NT32 would need to produce the required terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, wait: NT18's productions. Wait, no, earlier in the grammar, I don't see NT18 as a non-terminal. So maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the grammar is written. It could be that the S rules are S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32, where NT18 and NT32 are non-terminals, but perhaps NT18 is a typo, and the intended rule was S -> NT18 NT32, where NT18 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal string.\n\nBut in the end of the grammar, I see NT15 -> 't71', 't35', 't21', etc. But I don't see NT18 in the non-terminals, so maybe it's a mistake and should be NTsomething else, like NT32 or another number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S rules are S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32, but I'm not seeing NT18 in the non-terminals. Looking through the grammar, the non-terminals end up being numbers like NT32, NT18, etc. Wait, looking:\n\nYes, I do see NT32 in several places, but maybe NT18 isn't a non-terminal. It's possible that I read it wrong. Let me check again. Wait, in the grammar, after the initial rule, there's NT32 -> 't75' etc., but I don't see any rule for NT18 as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo and should be another NT, like NT17 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and NT18 is a non-terminal. Looking back, the initial productions under S are S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32. So maybe NT18 is a typo, perhaps NT35 or NT25, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar is that S -> NT18 NT32, and in the grammar, NT18 is a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT14 -> 't71'\n- NT15 -> 't68'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- etc.\n\nNo, I don't see any NT18. So perhaps it's a typo, and it should be another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT18 is a terminal, but that's unlikely because in the initial rules, S produces non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S rules are S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32, but NT18 is a non-terminal and for some reason, it's mapped to a terminal in the grammar. But looking through the grammar, the non-terms end with specific rules leading to 't's. So perhaps NT18 is a non-terminal that can only produce a specific terminal, or perhaps it's a terminal.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the S production should be S -> NT18 NT32, where NT18 is a non-terminal that eventually can produce a terminal. But in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT18.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should look at the string and work backwards.\n\nThe string is \"t75 t12 t74 t65 t28 t69 t69\". That's seven tokens. So to derive seven tokens starting from S, which is a non-terminal, we may need to have a parse where each non-terminal production contributes a certain number of tokens.\n\nIf we assume S is S -> NT18 NT32, and each NT18 and NT32 are non-terminals, we can try to expand them into more symbols until we get to terminals, matching the string.\n\nBut without knowing the rules for NT18, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps S can expand to a path that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which typically means each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S. The productions from S are `S \u2192 NT32 NT14` and `S \u2192 NT18 NT32`. So the string must start with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32, but let's look at the string.

Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let's try to parse the string from the end using a top-down approach, starting from S. Alternatively, I could try to find the sequence of productions that would generate this string.\n\nThe string is: t75, t26, t1, t68, t77, t63, t43, t69.\n\nFirst, looking at the first token, t75. I need to find a production for a non-terminal that eventually leads to t75. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 `t75`? No, wait, in the list, I see NT32 productions like NT32 -> `t75`? Let me scan the grammar carefully. Yes, I see `NT32 -> `t75` among the productions: yes, the last line before NT15 is `NT32 -> `t75`? Wait, no, looking back, the last entry before NT15 is `NT34 -> NT12 NT1`. No, I think I see `NT79 -> `t75` because in the productions, I have `NT32 -> NT79`. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, here's the production: `NT32 -> NT79`. So NT32 can produce NT79. Then, I need to find what NT79 produces. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT79 having a production that ends with a terminal. Or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check the grammar lines again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar more carefully. For example, line by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n- S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n- Other non-terminals: NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, etc.\n\nLooking for t75, I see in the productions, the last line is `NT34 -> NT12 NT1`. But wait, I think I might have missed it. Wait, at the end of the grammar, under NT79, it says `NT15 -> `t75`, but no, NT15 has multiple productions like `t15`, `t35`, `t69`, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Alternatively, maybe t75 is produced by NT32, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each production. For instance, `NT32 -> `t75`, but wait, is that the case? Let me check the list again. Looking through all the productions, I realize that I may have missed that NT32 indeed has a production that ends with `t75`. Alternatively, perhaps it's another non-terminal that leads to `t75`.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's see which non-terminals produce `t75`, `t26`, etc. For `t75`, I need a non-terminal that can derive it. Let me search for any production that ends with `t75`. Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> `t75` (in the production `NT79 -> `t75`). Yes, there's a production `NT79 -> `t75`, so NT79 can produce `t75`.\n\nSo, to get `t75`, we can have NT79 \u2192 `t75`. So the string starts with t75, so we can consider that part is derived from NT79.\n\nNow, what produces NT79? Looking at the grammar, I see: `NT79 -> `t75`? Or is it someone else?\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nThe productions for NT79 might be present, but perhaps I missed it. Wait, the last few lines have NT15 -> NT21 NT34, NT28 -> NT21 NT25, etc. Hmm, perhaps NT79 is produced by another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps `NT79` is a typo, and it's NT39. Alternatively, I might be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to see the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nThe string is: t75, t26, t1, t68, t77, t63, t43, t69.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So each step of the parse reduces the string by two symbols, replacing a non-terminal with two symbols, until only terminals remain.\n\nWait, but the string has 8 tokens. Since each production reduces the number of symbols by one (from A to BC, which is two symbols, but in the full derivation tree, it's more steps), the length of the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the number of steps. For 8 symbols, 2^3 - 1 = 7, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the string's derivation starts from S and goes through several productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of tokens and see if it's possible. Wait, 8 tokens would require n steps where 2^n -1 = 8. 2^3 -1 =7, 2^4-1=15. So 8 isn't a power of two minus one, which suggests it might not be possible. But wait, perhaps the string has 8 symbols, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the string is 8 symbols, which suggests that the parse might have 7 steps (since n-1 for production steps). Hmm, but 8 is not 2^3 -1, which is 7. Wait, 2^4 -1 is 15, which is more than 8. So this suggests that the string cannot be derived, as the number of symbols doesn't match the expected form. So the string must be invalid.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the Chomsky Normal Form. Let me think again. In CNF, each production is A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the initial S is a single non-terminal.\n\nThe first step would produce two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. But the number of symbols increases in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of symbols in the derived string is 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. For example, starting with S, which is one non-terminal. Applying one production, maybe S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which gives two symbols (two non-terminals). Then each of those can be expanded. So the total number of symbols can be 2, then 4, then 8, etc. But in our case, the string has 8 tokens, which is 2^3, so that's possible. So perhaps it's a valid parse.\n\nWait, but the initial string has t75, which is a terminal. So let's think about how the first symbol is derived. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then NT32 must derive t75.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string `t75 t53 t46 t32 t80 t69 t74 t69` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it seems complex with a bunch of production rules. The terminals are the strings ending with 't' followed by numbers, like 't75', 't53', and so on. The start symbol is S, which can be rewritten into various combinations of non-terminals. My goal is to see if the entire string can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nCNF means that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, every production on the left-hand side (LHS) of the rule has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side (RHS), except when it's a terminal.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match each symbol using the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree should be a binary tree, making parsing manageable.\n\nLet me write out the string:\n\nt75 t53 t46 t32 t80 t69 t74 t69\n\nI need to associate each terminal with a production that produces it directly. Looking through the grammar, I see that several terminals have productions ending with 't' followed by numbers:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t75\n- NT0 \u2192 t40 (but t40 isn't in the string)\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT30 \u2192 t26\n- NT14 \u2192 t43\n- etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t75. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 t75 is a rule. So, t75 is produced by NT32.\n\nSo, the first step is to have NT32 produce t75. Then, the next symbol is t53. Looking for a production that ends with t53. Scrolling through the rules, I notice that NT17 \u2192 t68, but that's not helpful. Also, NT6 \u2192 t24? Wait, no, let me look again. There's a rule NT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12. But wait, looking for t53:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 t68, but that's for 't68'. Not helpful. Alternatively, looking for NT that directly produce t53.

Let me check:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, I think I missed one. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12\n\nSo, NT6 is rewritten into two non-terminals, and not a terminal. So, t53 must come from a production that outputs 't' plus a number. Let's look for any NT that has a rule ending with t53.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production that produces 't53' directly. So, maybe I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a rule.\n\nWait, let me go through each production line and look for any that ends with 't53'. Checking:\n\nLooking through the list, the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT32, which would produce 't75 t75' if NT32 \u2192 t75. The next is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, producing 't...'\n\nLooking through, I see that NT19 \u2192 t15, but no 't53'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the list, there's a line:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nThen further down:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nAnd another:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\nWait, no 't53' yet.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I missed NT6 producing t53. But the rule for NT6 is NT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12, which are non-terminals. So, t53 must be part of the string, so the next symbol after t75 is t53, which is part of the string.\n\nSo, to get 't53', there must be a production NT6 \u2192 t53, but looking, I don't see such a rule. So perhaps that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I mislooked.\n\nWait, let me look again:\n\nThe list of rules includes:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nThen further down:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT19 NT5\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule where NT6 produces t53.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string uses a non-terminal that eventually produces t53 through other rules.\n\nWait, maybe the string starts with t75, which comes from NT32. Then, the next symbol is t53, so the NT after NT32 in the production must produce t53 as the next part.\n\nSo, the production would be something like NT32 \u2192 t75 NTX, where NTX produces t53.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any NT where NTX \u2192 t53? Or perhaps a production where NT produces t53 as a terminal.\n\nWait, in the list of rules, looking for any NT producing a terminal 't' plus a number, such that the number is 53. I don't see a production where NT ends with t53. So, perhaps 't53' cannot be derived as a terminal, meaning the string can't be generated. But that doesn't make sense because the grammar might have a production that eventually leads to t53 through multiple steps. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rule for NT6. Let me check again.\n\nThe rule for NT6 is: NT6 \u2192 NT24 NT12. So, NT6 can't produce a terminal, it's a binary non-terminal. So, the string's second symbol is t53, which must come from a terminal production. Since I don't see any NT that directly produces t53, I need to see if there's a production chain where some NT eventually produces t53.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t53 is part of a longer string, but since the string is exactly eight symbols, I need to find a way to produce each symbol in sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Maybe there's an NT rule I missed that ends with t53. Let's go through all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t75\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n\n- NT13 \u2192 t28\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t32\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t72\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t68\n\n- NT19 \u2192 t15\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t82\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-135","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t75 t26 t1 t69 t1 t1 t3 t69 t69` is generated by this grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules: every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions seem to fit into this form, so I'm good there.\n\nNext, I need to understand how the string is constructed. The string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, which likely represent terminal symbols in the grammar. My job is to see if these terminals can be derived through the given productions.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some of the productions lead directly to terminals. For example, NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', or 't34'. Similarly, many non-terminals have productions that lead to terminal symbols like 't1', 't2', etc. The more I look, the more I realize that the grammar has a significant number of direct terminal productions, which is a big clue.\n\nNow, the given string is `t75 t26 t1 t69 t1 t1 t3 t69 t69`. Let me list each of these terminals:\n\n1. t75\n2. t26\n3. t1\n4. t69\n5. t1\n6. t1\n7. t3\n8. t69\n9. t69\n\nI'll need to check if each of these terminals can be produced directly by some non-terminal in the grammar. Let's go through each one:\n\n- t75: Looking through the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 t75. So, NT32 is a non-terminal that directly produces t75.\n- t26: Similarly, NT20 \u2192 t26. So, NT20 produces t26.\n- t1: The grammar has a production where NT15 can produce 't1'. So, NT15 \u2192 t1.\n- t69: NT7 produces t69: NT7 \u2192 t69.\n- t1 (repeated): Again, NT15 \u2192 t1.\n- t1 (again): Same as above.\n- t3: NT14 \u2192 t3: NT14 \u2192 t3.\n- t69 (repeated): Once more, NT7.\n- t69 (again): Same.\n\nSo, every terminal in the string is directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. That means, in theory, each of these terminals can be the result of a single production step. This is a good sign because it suggests that the string could be produced by the grammar.\n\nNext, I need to consider the sequence of these terminals. Since each is produced directly, the string might be obtained by a series of productions where each non-terminal is replaced by a terminal. So, the entire string would be a sequence of terminal symbols directly produced without any non-terminals left.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if each step is possible. For example, the first symbol is t75, which comes from NT32. Then t26 comes from NT20. So, perhaps there's a way to derive the entire string by a certain sequence of steps.\n\nBut here's something to consider: the order of the terminals matters. The string is a concatenation of these terminals, so each one must come from a production that doesn't interfere with the next. Let me see if the grammar allows for such a sequence.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any non-terminals that produce multiple terminals in one step, except possibly some, but in this case, each terminal is directly produced. So, each 't' in the string can be generated by its respective non-terminal without any dependencies on other symbols.\n\nWait, but actually, the issue is that each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except when it's a direct terminal production. So, the string would have to be formed by a series of steps where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, but leading eventually to terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, which would require that each non-terminal is replaced directly, which isn't how CNF works unless the non-terminals are expanded all the way down directly to terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, you can have productions like A\u2192B, but that's not allowed because in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. Wait no, in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, there are no unit productions (A \u2192 B), only two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in some forms, Chomsky normal form allows for two symbols, which can be a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but in this case, the grammar seems to have only two non-terminals on the right side. So, for a production like NT32 \u2192 t75, that's a single terminal, so that's allowed in CNF because it's A \u2192 a.\n\nNow, considering that, the string we have is a sequence of a mix of single terminals, so each symbol in the string must be the result of such direct productions.\n\nBut in order for the entire string to be generated, each part of the string must be directly derivable. Let me see the initial string again: `t75 t26 t1 t69 t1 t1 t3 t69 t69`.\n\nSince each 't' is a terminal that comes directly from a production, that means each 't' can be generated in one step. However, in context-free grammars, the string is generated by applying productions step by step, starting from the start symbol, which in the given grammar is S.\n\nThe start symbol S can produce two options: either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So, to get the string, we'd have to expand S into two non-terminals, and then further expand those non-terminals until we reach all the terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, all the symbols are terminals, which suggests that the entire string must be derived by expanding S down through these productions. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLet me think of each symbol as being replaced by their respective non-terminals. For example:\n\n- t75 comes from NT32 \u2192 t75. So, NT32 must be a non-terminal in the left-hand side of a production. Indeed, I see that NT32 is on the right side of two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, S can produce NT32 as one of its children.\n\nSimilarly, t26 comes from NT20 \u2192 t26. So, in the tree, we'd also need a NT20 somewhere. Let me look back.\n\nWait, but the grammar has many non-terminals, and each terminal is directly linked to a non-terminal. So, for example:\n\n- t75 (NT32) is produced by NT32. So, if we have NT32 in the tree, it will produce t75 directly.\n- t26 is produced by NT20.\n\nBut then, the string is t75 t26 t1 t69 t1 t1 t3 t69 t69. Let's map this to the non-terminals:\n\nEach symbol must be a terminal, so each is produced by a respective non-terminal.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the parse tree would have to be structured such that each terminal in the string is a direct child of a non-terminal in the production steps.\n\nWait a moment, but how do we get from S to all these terminals? S can only produce two non-terminals, either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Then, each of those would need to be expanded further.\n\nFor example, if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT32 and NT14 must be further expanded. Each of those would produce their respective symbols.\n\nBut looking at S \u2192 NT32 NT14, let's see what each of these could produce.\n\nNT32 could produce t75, or more generally, NT32 can produce various symbols. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT32 seems to have only one production: NT32 \u2192 t75, or is it?

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let's look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string in question is composed entirely of terminals, specifically 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nSo, the string has 9 tokens: t75, t78, t80, t15, t26, t28, t69, t69, t69. The first thing I notice is that each of these could correspond to a single production step, so I might need to see if the string can be built step by step by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar and see how these terminals can be generated.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that several non-terminals produce terminals. For example, S -> NT32 NT14. So S can produce two non-terminals, each of which might produce terminals. \n\nI also notice that many non-terminals expand into other non-terminals until eventually, a terminal is produced. For example, NT32 might expand into something that eventually gives t75.\n\nLet me try to map each token to a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\n1. t75: Looking at the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 t75 (since NT32's production includes -> t75). So NT32 can produce t75.\n\n2. t78: Checking, NT28 \u2192 t78. So NT28 can produce t78.\n\n3. t80: NT28 \u2192 t80.\n\n4. t15: NT25 \u2192 t15.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. The productions show NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10. Then NT27 \u2192 t77, and NT10 can produce t42, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step, trying to construct the string by expanding non-terminals.\n\nFirst, the string is t75 t78 t80 t15 t26 t28 t69 t69 t69.\n\nThe entire string can be seen as a sequence of terminals. So, the start symbol S must expand to a sequence that, when all non-terminals are resolved, gives this string.\n\nLooking at the initial productions: S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLet's assume S expands to NT32 NT14, which would produce t75 (from NT32) and something from NT14.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 t43. Because I see NT14 producing t43. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the productions, I find:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21\n\nAnd then, looking at NT31: NT31 \u2192 't75' wait, or does it produce another non-terminal?\n\nWait no, looking back, I see:\n\nOh wait, the grammar has some entries that seem to produce terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', etc. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 t68, etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see a bunch of rules where non-terminals are directly mapped to 't' followed by a number. So for example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't21', 't1', 't5', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 \u2192 't28', 't6', 't40', 't80', etc.\n\nOkay, so some non-terminals produce single terminals. This will be crucial.\n\nSo perhaps I can model this as a series of steps where each non-terminal in the string is replaced by its corresponding terminal.\n\nLet me attempt to break down the string from the end:\n\nThe last three tokens are t69 three times. So let's see how 69 can appear.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t69. Scanning through the productions, I see NT31 \u2192 t69.\n\nSo, the last three t69s must come from NT31 expanding three times.\n\nSimilarly, earlier tokens: t28, which comes from NT28 \u2192 t28? Let's check. Looking at NT28's productions: I see NT28 \u2192 't28', 't21', 't0' etc. So, yes, NT28 can produce t28.\n\nSo, the second to last token is t28. So that would be NT28 \u2192 t28.\n\nFrom prior steps, to get a string ending with t28 t69 t69 t69, perhaps it's part of a larger context.\n\nWait, but looking at the string: t75 t78 t80 t15 t26 t28 t69 t69 t69.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nt75: Which non-terminal?\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t75. It seems NT32 produces t75. So NT32 \u2192 t75.\n\nSo the first NT32 would produce t75.\n\nThen, the next token is t78, which would come from another NT28, since NT28 \u2192 t78.\n\nThen t80: NT28 \u2192 t80.\n\nThen t15: Looking at NT25, which can produce t15.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT25's productions: NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10.\n\nBut if I follow this rule, I would have to expand these non-terminals further.\n\nWait, let me see: NT25 \u2192 NT27 NT10. Now, NT27 \u2192 t77, and NT10 \u2192 t42. So, replacing NT25 would give t77 t42, but that's not matching t15. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, wait, I'm looking for a production that directly gives t15. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT25 \u2192 t15. So yes, NT25 can directly produce 't15'.\n\nSo, if the next token after t80 is t15, that could be from NT25 \u2192 t15.\n\nSo, after t80 (which is NT28 \u2192 t80), comes t15 (from NT25 \u2192 t15).\n\nThen after that, t26: looking for a terminal 't26'. Checking the grammar, I don't see such a production directly. So perhaps t26 comes from a non-terminal that expands to it.\n\nLooking further, I see NT14 \u2192 't43', and other NTs. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, t26 could be a token produced by a non-terminal that eventually expands to it. Let me check all productions for 't26'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT directly producing t26. Hmm, maybe it's from a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to backtrack and consider the initial productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is generated as follows: S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would produce t75 and then whatever NT14 produces.\n\nBut earlier, looking at NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Then, maybe NT31 can produce t79? No, wait, looking at the grammar, NT31 can produce 't79' in some cases, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to represent the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, and see if it can be derived.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method, starting with S, and trying to expand it into the string.\n\nSo, S can become NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nIf it's NT32 NT14, then we have NT32 can produce t75, as we've established. So the first part would be t75, then NT14.\n\nBreaking down NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21.\n\nNT31 can produce various things, perhaps 't79' or other terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the next token is t78, not t79, so maybe this branch isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second alternative of S's production is better. S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nNT18 produces t74, as per the grammar (looking for NT18's productions: it goes to 't74').\n\nWait, but the second token in the string is t78, not t74.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or terminals. No epsilon productions, which simplifies things a bit. So, to generate the string, each non-terminal expansion should lead towards terminal symbols, but also, the string is a series of terminals, so I need to see how the non-terminals can be expanded to match this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S. The two initial productions for S are S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. That means the string should start with either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Let me note that the string starts with `t75` and then `t43`.\n\nSo, for S to derive the string, let's see where `t75` and `t43` come from. Looking at the productions, I see NT32 -> 't75'. Also, looking at NT32's other productions: NT30 -> NT2 NT22, which is a possible path. Wait, but how does that lead to 't75'? Maybe I need to look at which non-terminals derive to 't75' or other terminal symbols.\n\nWait, let me list out all the terminals and see which non-terminals produce them. From the grammar rules:\n\n- NT32 -> 't75'\n- NT18 -> 't46'\n- NT26 -> 't26' (from NT20 -> NT12 NT7 where NT7 -> 't1' and NT12 -> T78, but wait, looking directly, NT26 comes from S -> NT18 NT32 where NT32 is 't75' (so S -> 't46' 't75'). Hmm, but the string starts with t75, so that's S -> NT32 NT14. Which means NT32 is 't75' and NT14 must be a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at NT14, from the grammar: NT14 -> NT31 NT21. Let me see what rules NT14 can produce. Wait, no, NT14's productions are: NT14 -> NT31 NT21. Wait, no, the initial S is either S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. The string starts with 't75' (from NT32) followed by 't43'. So I need to see what NT14 can produce 't43'.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14 -> NT31 NT21. Let me check the productions for NT31. NT31 can produce 't15' through production NT31 -> 't35' but also has a production NT31 -> NT9 NT11. Hmm, but I'm trying to get to 't43'. Wait, maybe NT14 is another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at how the string continues. After 't75 t43', then we have 't26', 't78', etc. So maybe I should think about the structure of the string and how it can be derived.\n\nLet's note the string: t75 t43 t26 t78 t43 t19 t3 t35 t69 t69.\n\nSo the first part is NT32 -> t75, then NT14 must produce t43.

Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there are several NT14 productions. Let me check.

Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rules for NT26 are from somewhere else. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminal symbols.\n\nLet me go through the grammar and note which NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT32 -> 't75'\n- NT18 -> 't46'\n- NT26 -> 't26' (from NT20 -> NT12 NT7, but NT7->'t1', so maybe another path?

The string is `t75 t26 t1 t77 t1 t26 t68 t69 t69 t69`. So, first, I should look at the structure of the grammar and see how these 't' tokens are being generated.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a three-symbol form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals eventually produce a single terminal symbol, either by directly being assigned a terminal or through a series of productions that collapse down to a terminal.\n\nI also notice that some non-terminals are connected in chains leading to terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5, and NT5 could be NT27 NT21, and NT27 is NT25 NT10, etc., until it eventually produces 't1' or 't75' or other terminals. So, the string we're checking consists of a series of 't' tokens, each seemingly coming from a direct production of a terminal.\n\nLet's break down the string: `t75 t26 t1 t77 t1 t26 t68 t69 t69 t69`. Each 't' seems to be a terminal produced by either a direct production or through a chain of non-terminals that eventually result in that 't'.\n\nI'll start by matching the string step by step. The first token is 't75'. Looking at the grammar, NT32 \u2192 't75' (from grammar line: NT32 -> t75). So, S can produce NT32 NT14, and then each of those can produce their respective terminals.\n\nSo, for the first 't75', that's NT32, which would be followed by NT14. Looking at NT14 \u2192 't76' (grammar line: NT14 -> t76). Wait, but our string starts with 't75', then 't26', so maybe I'm misaligning. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production is a single step, meaning the string has to be generated in a way where each symbol is produced directly. But given the structure, it's more likely that the string is a linear sequence of terminals, each from a direct production.\n\nBut that might not be the case because some non-terminals can be derived through several steps, but in the end, each terminal is a single step. So, the entire string length is 10, so we need a parse tree that reduces each symbol step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be produced by a production in the grammar. Let me list all the terminals in the string and check if each is a directly produced terminal by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the direct terminals are:\n\n- nt1 \u2192 't1' (grammar: NT1 \u2192 t1)\n- nt5 \u2192 't5' (grammar: NT5 \u2192 t5)\n- nt6 \u2192 't6' (grammar: NT6 \u2192 t6)\n- nt7 \u2192 't7' (grammar: NT7 \u2192 t7)\n- nt8 \u2192 't8' (grammar: NT8 \u2192 t8)\n- nt10 \u2192 't10'\n- nt11 \u2192 't11'\n- nt13 \u2192 't13'\n- nt14 \u2192 't14'\n- nt17 \u2192 't17'\n- nt18 \u2192 't18'\n- nt19 \u2192 't19'\n- nt2 \u2192 't2'\n- nt3 \u2192 't3'\n- nt4 \u2192 't4'\n- nt22 \u2192 't22'\n- nt24 \u2192 't24' (grammar: NT24\u2192t24), but wait, in some productions, NT24 produces other non-terminals. However, there\u2019s a production NT24 \u2192 't42' (grammar: NT24->t42) and others.\n\nWait, looking back, some NT24 productions produce 't's. For example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24' directly (grammar: NT24 \u2192 t24)\n- But also NT24\u2192 t72 (from NT24->t72, etc.)\n\nWait, no. Let me look again. Actually, in the grammar, some NT24 productions produce terminals:\n\nLooking at:\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\nNT24\u2192 't42'\nNT24\u2192 't17'\n NT24\u2192 't21'\n NT24\u2192 't72'\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nLooking back: The user provided a list, so I need to check each production:\n\n- NT24 -> NT27 NT10\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT24 -> NT31 NT6\n- NT24 -> NT19 NT18\n- NT24 -> NT5 NT32\n- NT24 -> NT31 NT6\n- NT24 -> NT24 NT21\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar lines are:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't76'?\nWait, no. I'm getting mixed up. Let's look at the grammar again step by step.\n\nWait, for NT14: The user wrote NT14 -> 't77' (grammar line: NT14 \u2192 t77). Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar string:\n\nIn the provided grammar, some NT produce terminals:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't77' (line: NT14 \u2192 t77)\nNT19 \u2192 't1' (grammar: NT19 \u2192 t1)\nNT28 \u2192 't82' (grammar: NT28 \u2192 t82)\nNT2 \u2192 't28' (grammar: NT2 \u2192 t28)\nNT0 \u2192 't40' (grammar: NT0 \u2192 t40)\nNT7 \u2192 't40' (grammar: NT7 \u2192 t40)\nNT6 \u2192 't53' (grammar: NT6 \u2192 t53)\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, the productions that produce terminals are those where NT \u2192 't...', so perhaps NT25 \u2192 't64' and others.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the grammar lines:\n\nFor example:\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' (grammar: NT32 \u2192 t75)\n- NT26 \u2192 't26' (probably NT26?)\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-172","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the string is `t75 t69 t1 t1 t69 t74 t43 t69 t34 t3 t69`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar given. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a standard way to represent context-free grammars, so each production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, or a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, many rules have two non-terminals on the right, like S -> NT32 NT14. So that's CNF. But there are some rules where the right-hand side (RHS) is a terminal, but wait, in the given grammar, most of the RHS are either two non-terminals or maybe sometimes a terminal. Wait, looking closely, I see some rules like NT15 -> 't71', which seems to be terminals like 't' followed by a number. So it looks like the grammar allows terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, but I thought in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So yes, some RHS can be terminals, like the rules such as NT15 -> 't71' or NT31 -> 't75', etc.\n\nNow, the string to check is a sequence of terminals. My approach is to try to parse this string using the given grammar, attempting to find a derivation path that leads from the start symbol (S) to the entire string, expanding symbols step by step.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string again to have them clear: t75, t69, t1, t1, t69, t74, t43, t69, t34, t3, t69. So the string is a series of terms connected in order.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S has two productions: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So the string starts with two NTs, so we can try both possibilities.\n\nLooking at the first two symbols in the string: t75 and t69. So we need to find a way to derive t75 followed by t69 as the first two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT32 can produce certain things. Let me check NT32's productions: from the rules, NT32 can be broken down into something like NT10 NT20 (from NT32 -> NT10 NT20), or maybe others? Wait, let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, the productions for NT32 are:\n\n- NT32 -> NT10 NT20\n- NT32 -> NT24 NT18 (I think I saw this)\n- NT30 -> NT2 NT22\nWait, wait. Let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a list of lines, each starting with something like S -> NT32 NT14, etc. So let me look for NT32 in the rules.\n\nLooking through, I don't see an explicit rule NT32 -> something in the given list. Hmm, that's odd. Did I miss it? Let me go through each line.\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- 'S -> NT32 NT14' => yes, so S leads to NT32 followed by NT14. So if S is used, the first part would start with NT32. So the first symbol in the string must come from NT32's expansion.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is t75. Now, I need to see what NT32 can produce, because when expanded, it can lead to sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, NT32's productions may be derived from other NTs. For example, NT32 could be broken down into NT24 NT18 (as per one of the rules, I think I saw that). Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through, the rule 'NT24 -> NT32 NT17' is one of the rules. So NT24 can be broken down into NT32 and NT17. But that's a reverse: NT24 expands into NT32 and NT17. So for NT32, is there a rule that defines it in terms of other non-terminals?\n\nWait, maybe I look for rules where NT32 is the LHS. I see:\n\nHere's a line: 'NT32 -> NT10 NT20'. Yes, so NT32 can be expanded into NT10 and NT20.\n\nSo, the first two symbols of the string are t75 and t69. Let's see how these could result from NT32's expansion.\n\nNT32 is produced as NT10 followed by NT20. So let's see what NT10 and NT20 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT10: the grammar has a production NT10 -> NT7 NT22. So NT10 expands into NT7 and NT22.\n\nSimilarly, NT20 is present in the rules with 'NT20 -> NT12 NT7'. So NT20 expands into NT12 and NT7.\n\nNow, to get t75 and t69, let's see what NT10 and NT20 can produce.\n\nStarting with NT32 (which is t75 and t69?), wait no, NT32 is a non-terminal, so its expansion will result in the sequence of symbols from the two parts.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the string starting with t75 and t69. So after expanding NT32 into NT10 and NT20, the string must start with the expansion of NT10 followed by expansion of NT20.\n\nLet's look at the expansion of NT10: NT10 -> NT7 NT22. But NT7 is a non-terminal. Let's see if NT7 can produce 't75' or some part.\n\nLooking up NT7, the grammar has NT7 -> NT14 NT23 (from one production) and others. Hmm, but t75 is an output symbol, so we need a path where NT7 can produce 't75'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some terminals. For example, NT32 can't produce 't75' directly, but wait: Wait, I think I need to look through the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some rules have RHS with terminals:\n\n- NT31 -> 't9' 't11'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- etc.\n\nAh, so some of the non-terminals expand into terminals. So if NT7 can expand into two terminals that match, then it could produce a t.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal rules in the grammar to get the mappings.\n\nLooking through, the terminal rules are:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT19 -> 't1'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't28' (Wait, from earlier lines: 'NT13 -> NT6 NT18; NT18 -> t74; perhaps that's how it gets a terminal.)\nWait, perhaps it's better to just list all the terminal expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT15: 't71'\n- NT19: 't1'\n- NT28: 't74'\n- NT17: 't68'\n- NT13: 't28' (from a production that is expanded further into terminals)\n- Also, looking at other rules:\n\nAre there any?

The string is `t75 t78 t43 t21 t1 t49 t78 t40 t15 t69 t69`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that context-free grammars can be either in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) or other forms. The given grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, I see that most are of the form NT XYZ, which are non-terminals generating other non-terminals or terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with 't75'. I scan through the grammar rules to see if any non-terminals produce 't75'. Scanning, I see NT32 \u2192 t75. So the string starts with 't75' which would come from NT32.\n\nSo the first symbol is generated by NT32. Next, after 't75', the string has 't78'. Looking at the grammar for NT32, if I recall correctly, NT32 can produce multiple things. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT32 directly producing 't78' immediately. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT32 -> t75. So after NT32, it directly produces t75. But what about after that? So the first symbol is 't75', which comes from NT32. Then the next symbol is 't78'. How is 't78' generated? Looking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 t77, NT24 \u2192 t53, etc. But I don't see a production that directly gives 't78'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check all the terminal rules.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce 't78'. Wait, no, checking the list, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't78'. That's strange because the string starts with t75, then t78. Since NT32 only directly produces t75, this suggests that the entire string might not be part of the language. Or perhaps I'm missing how NT32 could lead to t78.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a longer derivation. So, after NT32 \u2192 t75, but the string has 't75 t78...', which doesn't make sense if NT32 only produces t75. Unless there's a way for t75 to connect to another production. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar. The rule for NT32 is: NT32 -> t75. So NT32 directly produces t75. So any string starting with t75 would be generated by NT32. But then the next symbol is t78, but NT32 doesn't have any further productions. That would mean the string cannot have t78 after t75 because NT32 can't produce anything else. Therefore, the string t75 t78... is not possible since after t75, only t75 can follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mistaken, and the initial NT32 could produce more than t75. Wait, checking the grammar again, the rule is NT32 -> t75. So NT32 produces t75 directly. There's no production for NT32 to produce another symbol. Therefore, any string starting with t75 followed by anything else would be invalid because NT32 can't generate more symbols.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after t75 comes t78. Since NT32 can't produce t78, the string can't start with t75 t78. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'. But I should make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is different. Wait, looking back, the first rule is S \u2192 NT32 NT32. Or was it S \u2192 NT32 something else? Wait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT34, S \u2192 NT18 NT32, etc. So S produces combinations of other non-terminals and terminals. But in the string, after 't75', which is a terminal, the next symbol is 't78', which is also a terminal. So I think the string is a series of terminals, not involving any non-terminals, which suggests that the string is composed entirely of terminals, which would only be possible if all the non-terminals in the production path can derive into those terminals.\n\nBut given that NT32 directly produces 't75', and the next symbol is 't78', which is not produced by NT32, it can't happen. Therefore, the string should not be generated by this grammar, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-195","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t75 t1 t1 t80 t26 t15 t42 t19 t3 t71 t69 t69`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all productions seem to be in CNF. So, the parser will work as expected.\n\nNext, I need to see if the string can be parsed according to these rules. The string ends with several 't' variables, like t75, t80, t26, etc., which I assume are terminals. Some rules, like T\u2192t*, are given, but here each 't' is a single terminal. Wait, in the grammar, certain symbols like 't59', 't69', etc., are terminals because they are written without anything after -> t, I think. For example, 't71' is a terminal.\n\nBut the grammar's productions start with S, N terminals, and then sometimes 't' followed by a number. I'm a bit confused because some of these 't's might not be terminals. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, some rules end with 't' and a number. For example, `NT15 -> 't71'` which means 't71' is a literal terminal. Similarly, some non-terminals produce terminals like 't26', 't32', etc. So, each occurrence of a terminal in the string must match one of these.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of 't' terms, which are either literals in the grammar (like 't71', 't26') or perhaps others. But the string given has all the 't's with numbers, so each must match exactly one of these.\n\nNow, let's look at the string: `t75 t1 t1 t80 t26 t15 t42 t19 t3 t71 t69 t69`.\n\nI need to check if each of these terms is present in the grammar as terminals. Let me list the terminal symbols from the grammar:\n\nFrom NT15 -> 't71', I see 71. NT23 -> 't34' but in the string there's no 34. NT0 -> 't32', which matches t32. NT7 -> 't1'. NT23 -> 't21'. NT29 -> 't28'. NT19 -> 't15'. NT31 -> 't69'. NT33 -> 't52'. NT24 -> 't12'. NT24 -> 't42'. NT30 -> 't26'. NT27 -> 't77'. NT17 -> 't68'. NT33 -> 't52'. NT29 -> 't62'. NT25 -> 't64'. NT24 -> 't17'. NT17 -> 't25'. NT8 -> 't46'. NT0 -> 't43'. NT24 -> 't79'. NT0 -> 't43'. NT31 -> 't35'. NT19 -> 't15'. NT23 -> 't70'. NT31 -> 't22'. NT6 -> 't53'. NT1 -> 't6'. NT0 -> 't19'. NT0 -> 't84'. NT13 -> 't33'. NT7 -> 't80'. NT4 -> 't56'.\n\nSo, the terminal symbols in the grammar are: 1, 3, 6, 7, 15, 17,19, 21, 25, 26, 28, 32, 34, 42, 43, 46, 50, 52, 56, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 71, 75, 77, 79, 80, 82, 84.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Some non-terminals produce one terminal. For example, `NT5 -> 't68'`, so 't68' is a terminal. Similarly, `NT13 -> 't28'`, so 't28' is a terminal, etc.\n\nSo looking at the string, each term must be in this list. Let's check the string's 't' terms:\n\nt75: Yes, from S \u2192 something; I don't have to check production, just existence. Yes, 75 is in the list.\n\nt1: Yes.\n\nt1: Yes.\n\nt80: Yes.\n\nt26: Yes.\n\nt15: Not a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, NT15 is a non-terminal, and 't15' is a terminal only if there's a production for NT15 -> 't15', which I don't see. Looking back, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any production that ends with 't15'. So 't15' is not a terminal, unless my memory is wrong. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n`NT19 -> 't15'`? Let me look. Yes: NT19 -> 't15' is present. So 't15' is a terminal, as per NT19 -> 't15'. So yes, 't15' is present.\n\nWait, in the string, the term is t15. So, as that's a terminal, it's acceptable as long as NT19 can produce t15.\n\nSo, t15 is present as a terminal.\n\nThen t42: Yes, from NT23 -> 't42'.\n\nt19: Wait, NT19 can produce t15 and t33, etc., so perhaps t19 is a terminal? Let me check: looking for NT19 -> 't19'. Is that in the grammar? Hmm, the given productions include `NT19 -> 't1'`, but not 't19'. So, t19 is a non-terminal, because there's no production for NT19 -> 't19' or any terminal other than 't1'. So 't19' cannot be a terminal, which contradicts its presence in the string.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The string has t19, which is supposed to be a terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT19 has a production to 't15' and another to 't33', but no production for 't19' as a terminal. So 't19' is a non-terminal, which is invalid in the string. Because terminals are the symbols that cannot be substituted.\n\nWait, unless there is a production for NT19 -> 't19', but I don't see it. So 't19' is a non-terminal in the string, which means the string contains a non-terminal, so it's not possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me check again. The string is `t75 t1 t1 t80 t26 t15 t42 t19 t3 t71 t69 t69`.\n\nEach of these terms: t75, t1, t1, t80, t26, t15, t42, t19, t3, t71, t69, t69.\n\nLet's check each:\n\n- t75: Yes, from S \u2192 NT30 NT32, etc.\n- t1: Yes, NT23 produces 't1'\n- t80: Yes, NT23 produces 't80' (looked it up earlier)\n- t26: Yes, NT30 \u2192 't26'\n- t15: Yes, NT19 \u2192 't15'\n- t42: Yes, NT23 \u2192 't42'\n- t19: Hmm, no production for NT19 as a terminal. NT19 can only generate 't1' or 't33'.\n- t3: Yes, NT1 \u2192 't6', which is different. Wait, wait, in the grammar, NT1 \u2192 't6', so 't3' is a terminal? Looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT3? Wait, somewhere in the grammar: looking for 't3', there's NT13 -> 't28', NT17 -> 't68', NT22-> 't3', so yes, NT22 produces 't3' as a terminal.\n\nSo, t3 is present.\n\nThen t71: Yes, S can produce 't71' (e.g., S \u2192 NT23 NT4, and maybe NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string provided is `t75 t69 t80 t1 t78 t40 t15 t3 t68 t70 t74 t69`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how this grammar works. CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side (RHS) of a non-terminal is exactly two terminals or non-terminals. That might make parsing and derivation easier because each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals have productions that lead to terminal tokens, like `t1`, `t3`, etc. For example, `S -> NT32 NT14`, and each of these NTs eventually leads to a terminal. So, the top-level production for S would result in a series of these terminals when fully expanded.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with `t75`, which is a terminal. Let me check if there's a production that starts with `t75`. Looking through the grammar, I see `NT31 -> 't69'`, but that's a terminal, not an NT. Hmm, perhaps `S` can eventually derive `t75` through a series of productions. \n\nLooking at S, it goes to NT32 NT14. Let me see where NT32 goes. Checking NT32's productions: there's one that says NT32 -> 't75'. So, S can go to NT32, which directly produces 't75'. That's a good start.\n\nNext, the second symbol is `t69`. So, after NT32, the next NT14 must produce something that leads to `t69`. Looking at NT14's productions, one is NT14 -> 't43' and another is NT14 -> NT31. Let's see where NT14 can go to get `t69`.\n\nWait, if NT14 goes to 't43', that's a terminal. Then what about NT14 -> NT31? NT31 can go to 't69' as per the grammar. So, S -> NT32 -> 't75' and NT14 -> NT31 -> 't69'. So the string starts with t75 t69. That seems correct.\n\nNext, the third symbol is `t80`. So, after t75 and t69, we have to see how the rest of the productions proceed. Let's think about how the grammar structures the string. Since each production in CNF results in two symbols, the entire string should be derived by a series of such steps without any single non-terminal being expanded into more than two symbols at a time.\n\nBut to make this clearer, maybe I should try to trace the derivation.\n\nStarting with S, which is two NTs: S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nNT32 -> 't75' (so that's done). NT14 needs to produce t69 and then t80. Wait, no\u2014each production in CNF is two symbols. So S becomes 't75' and NT14. But NT14 must be further expanded to produce the next part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the entire string's expansion. Let's consider the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t75 t69 t80 t1 t78 t40 t15 t3 t68 t70 t74 t69.\n\nI think each non-terminal contributes two terminals, except possibly the last one in each step.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to construct a parse tree for the string. Since the problem allows me to use any reasoning strategy, maybe I can test the string by checking each production step.\n\nAlternatively, since some non-terminals directly produce terminals, I can start by matching the string to the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is t75, which comes from NT32. So that's straightforward: S -> NT32 NT14, and NT32 -> t75.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t69. So the NT14 must be expanded to t69. Looking at NT14's productions, NT14 can be 't43' or NT31.\n\nIf NT14 is 't69', that's not an option. Wait, no, NT14's rule is either 't43' or NT31. So to get t69, NT14 must go to NT31, which then goes to 't69'. So NT14 -> NT31 -> t69.\n\nSo after S, we have t75 and t69. The next symbol is t80. Now, let's see how the grammar can produce t80.\n\nAfter the first two symbols, we have NT32 -> t75 and NT14 -> t69, but wait, no\u2014the full expansion is S -> NT32 NT14, which is t75 and then whatever NT14 produces. But in the string, the next symbol after t75 and t69 is t80. So perhaps after the first two steps, we're still in the middle of expanding NT14 beyond the initial production.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire string as a series of two-symbol productions. So S is NT32 NT14. NT32 is t75. Then NT14 must be expanded into a string that starts with t69 and followed by t80, etc.\n\nSo NT14's expansion after the initial 't43' or 'NT31', which gives t69, but then what comes next?\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to see if each part of the string can be matched step by step.\n\nAnother approach: the string is a series of terminals, and each production in the grammar uses two terminals or non-terminals. So for each position in the string, after the first two symbols, each subsequent symbol must be produced by another part of the grammar after expanding non-terminals further.\n\nWait, another way: think of the string as a concatenation of t75, t69, t80, etc., and see if each pair forms a production.\n\nWait, maybe I should see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar by following the production rules step by step. Let's try to parse the string.\n\nThe string is:\n1. t75\n2. t69\n3. t80\n4. t1\n5. t78\n6. t40\n7. t15\n8. t3\n9. t68\n10. t70\n11. t74\n12. t69\n\nLet me check S -> NT32 NT14.\n\n- NT32 produces t75, so that's the first symbol.\n- NT14 needs to produce the rest of the string. But how?\n\nNT14's rules are 't43' or NT31.\n\nIf NT14 produces t43, that's just a terminal, so the string would have t75 followed by t43, but the string is t75 t69, so that can't be. Therefore, NT14 must go to NT31, which produces t69.\n\nSo after NT32 and NT14, we have t75 t69.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t80. So we need to see how the grammar continues from t69.\n\nWait, actually, after the initial expansion of S, we have two non-terminals: NT32 and NT14. NT32 has already expanded to t75, so the next step is NT14.\n\nAfter NT14 -> NT31, which becomes t69, we have two non-terminals: S becomes t75 and NT31. Now, we need to expand NT31 further.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions: it can be 't69' or NT9 or 't35' or 't22' or NT24.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT31 has multiple productions. One is 't69', another is NT9 -> 't22', another is 't35', another is NT24, etc.\n\nSo if NT31 is 't69', then the string would go t75 t69 t69, but the third symbol is t80, so that's a problem. So perhaps NT31 is not 't69' here; instead, maybe it's another production that leads into t80.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at NT31's other productions.\n\nWait, wait\u2014NT31 can be 't69' directly. So let me see:\n\nAfter S is expanded to t75 (from NT32) and NT31 (from NT14), which is then expanded to t69. So the string is t75 t69, and then we're at the end of NT31's expansion, but the string continues. So the next symbol is t80, which would need to be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-217","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string \"t75 t17 t78 t46 t19 t74 t26 t15 t15 t68 t77 t63 t69\" is generated by this grammar. Hmm, CNF means each production is either a single symbol or a pair of non-terminals, right? But looking at the grammar provided, it seems a bit complex with a lot of productions. \n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of a sequence of \"t\" tokens with numbers, like \"t75\", etc. Each token in the grammar seems to be a terminal or a non-terminal that can be mapped to a string of terminals. For example, S is the start symbol, and there are productions like S -> NT32 NT14, which means S can be expanded into two NT non-terminals. \n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal. Here, looking at the productions, I see some productions like NT30 -> NT3 NT30, which are clearly left-recursive. Left recursion needs to be eliminated because standard parsers or charts don't handle it well, but maybe that's not directly relevant for this question. \n\nThe string is a concatenation of t-enclosed numbers: t75 t17 t78... Each \"t\" is a separate token, and each number is part of the string. So, the entire string can be viewed as a sequence of symbols like t75, t17, etc. \n\nI need to check if the grammar can generate this exact sequence. Let me see if the grammar has any productions that map directly to these t tokens. For example, I saw some productions like NT31 -> 't69', so NT31 can produce 't69'. Similarly, NT7 -> 't1' and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t75. So I need to see if there's a production that generates 't75'. Looking through the productions, I see NT32 -> 't75' and NT23 -> 't70', etc. So, NT32 can produce 't75'. \n\nSo, the string starts with t75, which corresponds to NT32. Then, next is t17. Looking for a production that gives 't17', I see NT17 -> 't68', not 't17'. Hmm, is there a production for NT17 that ends with 't17'? Let me check the list again. Oh, here's NT13 -> 't28' and NT22 -> 't3'? Not directly. Wait, perhaps NT17 has a production that leads to t17. Let me look: No, I see NT17 has NT17 -> 't25' and NT7 -> 't1'. Wait, is there a way to get t17? Or maybe the string is built from multiple NT expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t75 comes from NT32, and the next symbol is t17. So NT32 expands to 't75', and what comes after that? Let's think: the entire string is a sequence of these t-enclosed tokens, so each is a terminal symbol. So, the grammar must have a production chain that, starting from S, can produce this sequence by expanding non-terminals into terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So the derivation starts from S, and each step increases the number of symbols by one (since each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals). But the string given is a sequence of terminals, so the start symbol S must derive into a sequence of terminals, possibly after a number of steps.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either single symbol (a terminal) or two non-terminals. So a string of n terminals will require n-1 productions. Each production splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, increasing the count until you reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut in this case, the string is 13 tokens long, so the derivation needs to start from S and go through 12 steps. Hmm, that's possible but might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can work backwards, trying to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nTo parse \"t75 t17 t78 t46 t19 t74 t26 t15 t15 t68 t77 t63 t69\", starting from the end.\n\nThe last token is t69. Looking at the productions, I see that NT31 -> 't69'. So that could be the last step. Before that, what comes before t69 in the string? It's t76... wait, string is t75, t17, t78, t46, t19, t74, t26, t15, t15, t68, t77, t63, t69. So the last token is t69, which is from NT31.\n\nBefore that, the token is t63. So the last two symbols are t63 t69. To get t63 and t69 in that order, the previous step must produce something that can derive into t63 and t69 in two steps. Wait, maybe t63 is from NT33 -> 't52'? Wait no, looking for 't63' and 't69' as terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions. NT15 has several productions: 't71', 't35', 't34', 't59', 't40', 't21', 't29', 't24', 't5', etc. But 't63' is produced by NT27 -> 't77' and NT5 -> 't64' and NT25 -> 't64'. Hmm, I might be getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for tokens that are terminals and see if they can be produced directly by the grammar. For example, t75 is produced by NT32, which is a non-terminal. So 't75' must be the first symbol. Then, the second symbol is t17. So the production after S must produce t75 and something else, which then produces t17 and so on.\n\nBut to go from S to the given string, we'd need to have a derivation that starts at S and results in the sequence t75 t17... So perhaps the initial production is S -> NT32 NT14, as that's one of the options. Then NT32 can be expanded into 't75' directly, and NT14 can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT14, one of its productions is 't43', another is 't31'. Hmm, but t17 is needed. So maybe NT14 isn't the right path after t75. Alternatively, maybe other productions of NT14 could lead to t17, but I don't see any. NT14's productions include 't43', 't31', but nothing that gives 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT17: production rules are NT17 -> 't68' and NT7 -> 't1'. Hmm, that doesn't help with t17. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look for production that can give t17.\n\nWait, I see NT23 -> 't70', and other NT terminals, but nothing gives t17 directly. Alternatively, perhaps t17 is derived through a chain of non-terms. For example, NT17 -> something that can produce 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting symbol S is expanded into two non-terms, each of which then expands into the sequence. So starting with S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nNT32 -> 't75' (as per the production NT32 -> 't75'). Then, NT14 needs to expand into the rest of the string, which starts with t17.\n\nBut looking at NT14's productions: It doesn't seem to have a production that results in 't17'. Instead, NT14 -> 't43', 't31', 't26', etc. So if I choose NT14, it would produce 't43' or another terminal, which doesn't help with getting 't17'.\n\nSo maybe S -> NT32 NT14 isn't the right path. Alternatively, S could be expanded via another production.\n\nLooking through all the S productions, there's S -> NT30 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So another option is S -> NT30 NT14.

{"custom_id":"request-218","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the string `t75 t80 t78 t80 t15 t46 t40 t77 t1 t63 t84 t43 t69` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the way we can approach the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of a series of productions starting from the start symbol S. Each non-terminal on the left side of a production expands into another non-terminal or a terminal. Since all productions are two-symbol right-hand sides (except for the terminal 't' symbols), the grammar is in CNF. This means that any string generated must be of length equal to the number of productions in a derivation. So, each step in the derivation introduces exactly one terminal symbol, and the number of steps is equal to the length of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's composed of 13 terminal symbols: t75, t80, t78, t80, t15, t46, t40, t77, t1, t63, t84, t43, t69. So, the length is 13, which means the derivation would go through 13 productions, starting from S and ending with the string.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production always introduces exactly one non-terminal into a terminal and a non-terminal. That is, each step reduces the number of non-terminals by one but keeps track of the derivation. Wait, no, actually, each production in CNF is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. The start symbol S is eventually used up, but the actual string is derived by expanding S and then each non-terminal into terminals and the process repeats until the entire string is terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, a string derived from a CNF grammar must have a length that's at least the number of steps, but more importantly, each non-terminal production will take the sequence and insert a non-terminal which may later be expanded into symbols. However, in our case, the string is given as a sequence of terminals, so each step must eventually resolve each non-terminal into a terminal.\n\nBut each derivation step replaces a non-terminal with another non-terminal and a terminal, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So, each production either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal. So, the derivation starts with S and replaces S with some combination, but each production must eventually reach a terminal.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. In CNF, each production is either a single terminal or A \u2192 BC, meaning each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side (for the binary productions), but that's only in CNF if the right-hand side is two symbols where both are non-terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. But in our case, the given grammar seems to have all productions except the terminal ones as A \u2192 BC. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals. So each production either is a two-part non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals (e.g., NT30 -> NT3 NT30; S -> NT32 NT14) or sometimes a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or two terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal production.\n\nSo, when generating a string, each production step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with one or two symbols. However, in our case, each string in the given example is composed solely of terminals. So, the derivation would have to resolve each non-terminal down to a terminal, ensuring that the entire string is built by this process.\n\nEach production that is a terminal terminates that path, while the non-terminals will need to be resolved further. So, for the entire string to be generated by the grammar, every non-terminal in the derivation must eventually be expanded into a terminal symbol.\n\nBut considering the given string, each symbol in the string must be produced by some production where the non-terminal eventually leads to that terminal. So, I need to check for each terminal in the string whether it can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t75, t80, t78, t80, t15, t46, t40, t77, t1, t63, t84, t43, t69.\n\nI'll go through each one to see if I can find a production that leads to them.\n\nLet's start with t75. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT2 -> t80 is a production, but there's also S -> NT32 NT14. So, if S expands into NT32 and NT14, each of these may expand further. Let's see where t75 can come from.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT31 -> 't69' is a production, so t69 is a terminal, but where does that come from? Let's track where t69 is used. In the grammar, NT24 -> 't79' and NT0 -> 't71', and others. Wait, perhaps I should construct the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the grammar contains any productions that can lead to these terminals.\n\nLooking for t75: NT31 -> 't69', but that's a separate terminal. Wait, I'm looking for t75 in the terminal list. Wait, maybe I made a mistake: in the grammar, NT30 -> 't26' is present. Hmm. I think I need a better approach.\n\nAnother way is to check if each terminal in the string can be reached from any non-terminal in the grammar via some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, there are several terminals listed: t75, t80, t78, t15, t46, t40, t77, t1, t63, t84, t43, t69.\n\nLet me list all the terminals present in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- 't75' appears in NT24 -> 't84'\n- 't80' appears in S -> NT32 NT14, and others\n- 't78' in NT31 -> 't78'\n- 't15' appears multiple times, like NT15 -> 't15', and others\n- 't46' in NT19 -> 't46'\n- 't40' in NT19 -> 't40' and also NT0 -> 't40', and others\n- 't77' in NT0 -> 't77'\n- 't1' in several places: NT15 -> 't1', NT23 -> 't1', NT17 -> 't1', etc.\n- 't63' in NT0 -> 't63'\n- 't84' in NT24 -> 't84'\n- 't43' in several places, including NT15 -> 't43'\n- 't69' in NT0 -> 't69'\n\nSo each terminal in the string is present as a direct production. Now, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some node in the grammar through a sequence of productions.\n\nFor example, t75: Is there any production that leads to t75? Looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 -> 't75' is not a production. Wait, no, in the provided list, I don't see 't75' as a direct production. Wait, let me check again: NT24 -> 't75'? Looking back, I don't see that. Wait, in the given productions, NT24's productions are listed as:\n\nNT24 -> 't84' (from S? Wait, S has S->NT32 NT14, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the full list:\n\nLooking for NT24, the productions are:\n\nNT24 -> 't75' is not listed.\n\nWait, in the provided list, let's see:\n\nYes, here's a production: NT24 -> 't75' when looking at NT17's productions:\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, do any of the NTs have a production to t75? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't80'\n\nNT14 -> MT13\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, under NT17's productions: NT17 -> NT4 NT22 and others. But I don't see NT24 -> t75.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me take this step by step because it seems a bit complex, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a special case of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Oh, but looking at the given grammar, I see some production rules that look like S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or something like that. So each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for a few that turn into terminals directly, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or NT4 \u2192 t68. Wait, but in CNF, each production should have only two non-terminals, right? So I guess for terminals, it's allowed, but in this case, I notice some rules directly produce a terminal. So maybe it's more like a mix, perhaps extended CNF where some rules produce a single terminal.\n\nAnyway, the string to evaluate is: `t75 t78 t80 t1 t69 t80 t26 t15 t15 t1 t68 t63 t69 t69`.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse context-free grammars. But since the grammar is in CNF (or close to it), the CYK algorithm should work fine. But wait, CYK requires the grammar to be in a specific form, usually without \u03b5 productions and with each production having exactly two non-terminals on the right. Hmm, but in this case, some rules directly produce terminals like NT4 \u2192 t68, which would correspond to \u03b5 productions, right? So maybe this affects the CYK approach because CYK can handle \u03b5 productions but in this case, it's mixing something else.\n\nAlternatively, since the question is about whether the string is in the language, perhaps I can try to work backward by starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step. Let me check the grammar rules again to see which start with S. The first two rules are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S produces two non-terminals, each of which must be expanded into a sequence that includes the terminals in the given string.\n\nLet me see the given string: the first token is t75, last is t69. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT32 can be directly part of the string as a terminal. Wait, no, NT32 is a non-terminal; it's only when a rule produces it as a terminal that it's replaced. Looking at the rules, for instance, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 means that NT32 and NT14 are non-terminals that need to expand into sequences of terminals. Similarly, the other S rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, but also, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT19 \u2192 t15 or NT7 \u2192 t1, etc. So perhaps each step in the derivation will involve replacing a non-terminal with a sequence that can eventually produce the correct terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be produced by some rule.\n\nSo the first idea is to model the derivation as a sequence of rules applied to S, and then checking if each token matches the production rules. But the given string is quite long, so manually checking might be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can represent each non-terminal and the possible terminals they can produce, but I need to see which sequence of non-terminals would expand into this string.\n\nLooking more carefully, let's see if I can find any immediate matches. For example, the string starts with t75. Looking at the grammar, is there a production that directly produces t75? Looking through the rules, I notice NT32 \u2192 t75 is a production. So if I can generate the string starting with NT32, that might work.\n\nWait, but NT32 can also be part of longer productions, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So perhaps the first part of the string corresponds to S, which is derived into NT32 and NT14. Now, NT14, looking at the rules, for example, NT14 \u2192 t43, so maybe t43 is another part of the string. Wait the string starts with t75, which is NT32, and the next is t78, but looking at NT32's rules, it seems to produce t75, not sure about t78.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and see where they come from. Let me list the string tokens: t75, t78, t80, t1, t69, t80, t26, t15, t15, t1, t68, t63, t69, t69.\n\nLooking at each of these, do they appear as direct terminals in the grammar? For example:\n\n- t75: Looking at the rules, NT32 \u2192 t75 is explicitly present.\n- t78: I don't immediately see any production that directly produces t78. Wait, but perhaps it comes from some combination. Maybe from a longer production, like NT27 \u2192 something and then another production leading to t78? Hmm, but let's see if t78 can come from another non-terminal. Let me check NT27 \u2192 NT10 NT7. Then NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT5, and NT22's rules: well, NT22 \u2192 t78, perhaps? Let me check the rules. Yes, looking at the grammar, I see a rule NT22 \u2192 t78. So t78 comes from NT22.\n\nSo t75 comes from NT32, t78 from NT22, then t80 from NT32 as well because NT32 goes to t75 and something else maybe? Wait, no, NT32 is only directly producing t75, not t80. So wait, I must have missed that. Let me check the rules again. Oh, I see NT33 is connected to NT22 and NT11, but I don't see NT32 being anything else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, S can derive into NT32, which then can derive into t75. So the first part would be NT32, which is t75, but what comes next? The string after t75 is t78. So perhaps after NT32 (t75), there's another non-terminal that generates t78. According to the rules, after S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the second part is NT14, which produces t43. Wait, but t78 is in the string, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial steps are different. Maybe the string starts with t75, so let's think of this as a derivation starting with S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would then need to expand into t75 followed by something. But the next token is t78, which doesn't correspond to NT14's direct terminal, so maybe that's not correct. Or perhaps the NT14 somehow produces t78 through other rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, I notice that NT22 \u2192 t78 is a direct production. So if somewhere in the derivation, NT22 is produced, it can give t78. Similarly, NT30 can directly give t75, so that could explain t75.\n\nSo perhaps the structure is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, where NT32 becomes t75, and NT14 somehow becomes t78 somehow, but I don't see a direct production for t78 in NT14's rules. So maybe this is the wrong approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire string trying to fit inside some non-terminals. Let's see, the string is: t75 t78 t80 t1 t69 t80 t26 t15 t15 t1 t68 t63 t69 t69.\n\nPerhaps I can group these into chunks that correspond to the productions. For example, t75 is NT32 \u2192 t75, then t78 perhaps comes from NT22 \u2192 t78, t80 is NT22 \u2192 t80, etc.\n\nWait, I need to think about this systematically.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two non-terminals on the right, except possibly for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. However, looking at the rules, some seem to have more than two non-terminals, which might be a mistake. Wait, no\u2014the first two rules are S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. The rest look like more complex productions, possibly with multiple non-terminals. CNF requires that each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. But wait, some rules seem to have three non-terminals, like NT28 -> NT21 NT25 NT24. That can't be right because it breaks the CNF structure. Maybe I misread or perhaps it's a typo. Hmm, but I need to proceed regardless.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like `t75`, `t1`, etc. These look like terminal symbols since they're presumably representing terminal characters in the language. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar's productions, the start symbol is S. I should see which productions of the start symbol can lead to the given string.\n\nThe initial productions of S are:\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, from S, the first step is to produce a sequence starting with NT32 or NT18 followed by NT14 or NT32, respectively. These NTs (Non-terminals) are then expanded into other non-terminals until they become terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t75`, which I need to see how it's derived. Let's see where `t75` appears. In the grammar, searching for `t75`, I find it in the rule NT24 -> 't75'? Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, the rules ending with 't' are:\n\nNT24 -> 't72'\n\nWait, no, let me parse this correctly. The rules in the grammar end with either another non-terminal or a 't' with some number. For example, the rule NT31 -> 't24' is in the list. Wait, wait, it's actually:\n\nNT23 -> 't34'\n\nNT0 -> 't40'\n\nNT23 -> 't59'\n\nNT31 -> 't69'\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\n\nNT23 -> 't21'\n\nNT29 -> 't28'\n\nNT24 -> 't72'\n\nNT5 -> 't68'\n\nNT19 -> 't1'\n\nNT28 -> 't82'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT0 -> 't71'\n\nNT32 -> 't75'\n\nNT2 -> 't80'\n\nNT12 -> 't78'\n\nNT20 -> 't26'\n\nNT9 -> 't49'\n\nNT17 -> 't68'\n\nNT13 -> 't28'\n\nNT2 -> 't49'\n\nNT30 -> 't26'\n\nNT21 -> 't69'\n\nNT17 -> 't82'\n\nNT10 -> 't42'\n\nNT18 -> 't74'\n\nNT23 -> 't19'\n\nNT22 -> 't3'\n\nNT14 -> 't43'\n\nNT3 -> 't1'\n\nNT7 -> 't40'\n\nNT24 -> 't12'\n\nNT24 -> 't42'\n\nNT30 -> 't63'\n\nNT27 -> 't77'\n\nNT17 -> 't65'\n\nNT33 -> 't52'\n\nNT29 -> 't62'\n\nNT25 -> 't64'\n\nNT24 -> 't17'\n\nNT17 -> 't25'\n\nNT8 -> 't46'\n\nNT0 -> 't32'\n\nNT24 -> 't79'\n\nNT0 -> 't43'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT19 -> 't15'\n\nNT23 -> 't70'\n\nNT31 -> 't22'\n\nNT6 -> 't53'\n\nNT1 -> 't6'\n\nNT0 -> 't19'\n\nNT0 -> 't84'\n\nNT13 -> 't33'\n\nNT7 -> 't80'\n\nNT4 -> 't56'\n\nAdditionally, I notice that NT15 -> 't71' and NT15 has two rules: 't71' and 't35' and 't21' (maybe multiple rules for the same). Similarly, other NTs can derive to various 't's.\n\nGiven the string starts with `t75`, which seems to be derived from NT24 -> t75 as per the first rule: NT24 -> 't72'? Wait, no. Let me check: I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for 't75' in the productions, I see NT24 -> 't72' and NT32 -> 't75'. So, in the grammar, the production is S -> NT32 NT14, so from S we can expand to NT32 and NT14. Then, if NT32 can be expanded to 't75' and NT14 to 't1', that would give us the first two 't's: t75 and t1.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the string, after t75 t1, the next token is t80. Let's track how that could be generated.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\nt75 t1 t80 t3 t78 t19 t68 t82 t78 t69 t74 t1 t3 t69\n\nBreaking it down in terms of productions:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n   - NT32 -> t75\n   - NT14 -> t1\n   So, that gets us the first two tokens.\n\n2. Next token is t80. So after NT14 (t1), we have NT14 -> something that produces t80. Wait, but in the grammar, NT14's production is either NT31 NT21 or 't43'. Wait, is that right? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at NT14: the rules are:\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT14 -> NT31 NT21\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me double-check:\n\nWait, the given grammar has these rules for NT14:\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\nNT14 -> 't43'\n\nSimilarly, for NT14:\n\nSo, from NT14, it can be either 't43' or NT31 followed by NT21.\n\nSo, after t1 (from NT14), to get t80, perhaps the next part is NT14 -> NT31 NT21, but then that would produce two tokens, but in the string, the next token is t80, which is one token, so that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe NT14 can derive to t43, but t43 is not present in the string.\n\nWait, the third token is t80. So, after t1, we have t80, which is the third token. So, perhaps we have to look further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. The first step is S -> NT32 NT14. Then, NT32 is expanded to t75, and NT14 is expanded to, say, another non-terminal that can produce t80. Alternatively, perhaps NT14 can produce a sequence that starts with t80.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the production NT13 -> NT6 NT18, which might be expanding to something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the initial S -> NT32 NT14 (t75 t1), then from NT14, we can have other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the entire derivation step by step. Let's consider:\n\n1. Start with S.\n\n2. S -> NT32 NT14.\n\n3. Now, we have to expand NT32 and NT14.\n\nNT32's productions: Looking at the rules, NT32 can be expanded as:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22 (if that's correct). Wait, in the grammar, do we have NT32 -> NT2 NT22? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nThe rules for NT32 are:\n\n- NT32"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t75 t77 t42 t40 t75 t59 t15 t25 t78 t6 t78 t3 t1 t3 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.

Now, the string given has 15 tokens. Let me list them again to make sure I count correctly:\n\nt75, t77, t42, t40, t75, t59, t15, t25, t78, t6, t78, t3, t1, t3, t69.\n\nEach of these must be derived from the grammar. The first thing to check is if each terminal is present in the productions. Looking through the productions, I see that each terminal in the string is indeed produced by some rule. So, none of them are missing. But that doesn't guarantee that the string is in the language because the order and structure must also be correct.\n\nSince the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, the parse trees will be binary, meaning each production either introduces a single terminal or combines two non-terminals. Therefore, the string must be parseable into such a structure.\n\nOne approach is to try to build a parse tree for the string. However, with a large string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to match the string step by step, using the productions to reduce the string.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string using the grammar. I'll start from the leftmost symbol and see if I can use a production to derive the string.\n\nThe string starts with t75, which is directly produced by S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so the first step is to have S produce NT32 NT14. So, the parse stack would be NT32, NT14, followed by the rest of the string.\n\nThe next symbol is t77. Let's see if there's a production that can produce t77. Looking through the productions, I see NT77 isn't present, but wait, let's check:\n\nWait, in the productions, there's NT27 \u2192 NT27 NT10 and NT27 \u2192 t77. So, NT27 can produce t77. So, to get t77, we'd have to have a production where NT27 is on the left, and it's replaced by t77. So, in the production, we'll have t77 where NT27 is used.\n\nBut to get t77, the preceding NT27 must be generated by some rule.

Let me start from the beginning and try to see if I can match each part.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, S is replaced by NT32 NT14. The first two symbols should be the results of NT32 and NT14.\n\n2. Next symbols: t75, t77. So, after S, we have t75, which is from NT32, and then t77. So, let's see what produces t75.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that most of the non-terminals have productions that result in terminal symbols (like 't') or other non-terminals. For example, NT20 \u2192 t26, which means NT20 produces 't26'. Similarly, NT23 \u2192 t34 means NT23 directly produces 't34'. So many non-terminals are directly mapped to specific terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is composed of these terminal symbols: t75, t74, t77, etc. So I need to see if there's a way to derive this sequence using the grammar.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the string: t75 t74 t77 t46 t32 t40 t46 t78 t69 t69 t34 t78 t40 t74 t69.\n\nI'll number each token for clarity:\n\n1. t75\n2. t74\n3. t77\n4. t46\n5. t32\n6. t40\n7. t46\n8. t78\n9. t69\n10. t69\n11. t34\n12. t78\n13. t40\n14. t74\n15. t69\n\nI'll start by looking at the first token, t75. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 \u2192 t75. So NT24 can produce t75.\n\nNow, NT24 has multiple productions. One is NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT14, and another is NT24 \u2192 t74. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT24 has several rules, one of which is NT24 \u2192 t74. So, NT24 can directly produce t74. But wait, t75 is the first token, so maybe I need to see if there's a path for t75.\n\nWait, let's double-check. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t74 is one production, and NT24 also has other productions involving non-terminals. So for the first token, t75, it must come from a non-terminal that produces t75. From the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 t75 is not a direct production. Wait, no, checking the rules again:\n\nLooking again, I don't see NT24 \u2192 t75. Instead, the first rule I see with t75 is NT23 \u2192 t34. Hmm, so maybe I'm misremembering. Let me check carefully:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT3 -> t1, NT7 -> t40, etc. Let me list the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminal productions (those that produce specific 't' symbols) are:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t26\n\nNT23 \u2192 t34\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT0 \u2192 t40\n\nNT7 \u2192 t40\n\nWait, I'm seeing several:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t26\n\nNT23 \u2192 t34\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28\n\nNT0 \u2192 t40\n\nNT7 \u2192 t40\n\nHTMl: wait, the user provided a long set of grammar rules. Let's go step by step.\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't' followed by a number:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t26\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t1\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t42\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t49? Wait, no. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT28 appears in several rules, some producing other non-terminals, but in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't*N*': For example, NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc.\n\nSo, in the grammar, the non-terminals NT15, NT23, NT31, etc., can produce specific 't' strings.\n\nHmm. Let's approach this differently. Since the string starts with t75, I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t75.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that produces t75 directly. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t74? No, I think that's a non-terminal leading to t74, but perhaps another rule is NT24 \u2192 t75. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me go through each production:\n\nNT24 appears in several rules:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT7 NT14\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n\nAnd others, but maybe the first rule is NT24 \u2192 t74? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I don't see NT24 \u2192 t75. Instead, I see NT24 has various non-terminal productions, but no direct 't75' production. So perhaps the initial 't75' isn't directly produced by any NT, but maybe by combining non-terminals.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because for the string to start with t75, there must be a rule that produces t75 directly. Since I don't see any rule NT -> t75, is that possible? Or maybe I'm missing it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-276","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, with A, B, C being non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. However, looking at the provided grammar, I notice that there are longer right-hand sides, like some NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22 NT15. That might indicate that the grammar isn't strictly in CNF, but perhaps it's written in a way that still fits CNF. Alternatively, maybe some rules are allowing for more than two symbols on the right side. Wait, actually, in CNF, it's only two symbols. So if any rule has three or more non-terminals, then that would violate CNF. Looking back, I see some rules like NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which is two symbols; others like NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22 NT15, which has three symbols. Hmm, that suggests some ambiguity here. Maybe the user made a mistake, or perhaps the grammar is slightly non-CNF. Alternatively, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, actually, looking more closely, I see some mix of rules. Some are two symbols, others are more. Let me check again. For instance, NT15 has several production rules, some are two symbols, some are more. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in representation. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar isn't in proper CNF, but the user still presented it as such. Hmm. Well, perhaps the best approach is to proceed, trying to see if the string can be derived using these rules, regardless of the strict CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t75 t49 t40 t78 t40 t15 t1 t65 t46 t19 t1 t77 t63 t25 t71 t69`.\n\nI notice that many of these symbols are terminals, such as 't75', 't49', etc. The rest are non-terminal symbols (NT something). So to parse the string, I'll need to apply the grammar rules to see if I can derive the string using these non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLet me start by identifying the order of the terminals. The string is a sequence of these 't' symbols, each with a number. The key is to see how these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to work backwards. The start symbol is S. So S should eventually produce the entire string. But in the provided grammar, the start symbol S has two production rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT3T14\nWait, looking at the grammar above, I see:\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, I think I misread the production rules for S earlier. Let me check again. The user provided the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the user wrote:\n\nFirst two rules for S:\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nBut I'm now noticing that in the grammar, it's written as:\nS -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, no, in the user's message, it's written as:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32 ?\n\nWait, no, actually looking at the first two lines under the grammar, the user wrote:\n\n```\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\n```\n\nWait, that can't be, because the user probably made a typo, maybe. Wait, in the initial part, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: \nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT4 -> NT25 NT6\n...\", etc.\"\n\nWait, that would mean S can produce either two NT32s or an NT18 followed by an NT32. But looking further, I see that the start symbol S is in two production rules, each with two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to present the grammar correctly. Well, in any case, I'll proceed.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it's 16 symbols long. Let's see how each 't' can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is 't75', which I notice has a production rule in the grammar: NT31 \u2192 't69', but wait, looking at the end of the user's grammar, under the 31 section, I see:\n\nNT15 -> 't15'\nNT31 -> 't69'\n\nWait, no. Wait, the user's grammar for NT31 includes multiple rules, some mapping to specific 't's:\n\n- NT15 -> 't43'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT24 -> 't79'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT7 -> 't80'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT24 -> 't12'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT30 -> 't63'\n- NT27 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't65'\n- NT33 -> 't52'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT25 -> 't64'\n- NT24 -> 't17'\n- NT17 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't46'\n- NT0 -> 't32'\n- NT24 -> 't79'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT31 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT1 -> 't6'\n- NT0 -> 't19'\n- NT0 -> 't84'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't80'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I see that NT31 has a production rule to 't35'. But looking at the string, the first part is 't75', which isn't a terminal, so it must be derived from a non-terminal. So, 't75' must be the result of some NT32, but in the string, 't75' is at the start.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production rule where NT32 can directly produce 't75'.

{"custom_id":"request-278","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: t75, t49, t40, t1, t68, t77, t69, t15, t15, t1, t63, t68, t1, t25, t69.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means the grammar only has production rules of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the grammar provided, it seems a bit more complex. I see a mix of non-terminals like S, NT32, NT14, etc., and some rules that have terminals like 't71', 't35', and so on. But the structure of the grammar is mostly in CNF, with each non-terminal expanding into two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar, some production rules produce a terminal and a non-terminal together, like NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23. But in CNF, each production should have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So some rules here might be problematic because they have a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two non-terminals and a terminal. For example, NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1, which seems okay because it's two non-terminals. But what about NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23? That's also two non-terminals. Wait, no, maybe it's possible that the grammar is in CNF with optional epsilon productions, but I don't see any epsilon rules here. Hmm, maybe not. But I think CNF requires that each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal, so perhaps the grammar is actually in slightly non-standard CNF. Maybe that's just a minor observation, but for the problem, I can proceed.\n\nNow, the string starts with t75, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals expand into t75. From the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 t75. So S must eventually expand to involve NT32 and NT14 somewhere.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, which suggests a derivation starting from S, expanding non-terminals step by step until only terminals are left, forming the string.\n\nLet's break down the string:\n\nt75, t49, t40, t1, t68, t77, t69, t15, t15, t1, t63, t68, t1, t25, t69.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, each step either combines two non-terminals into two others or replaces one with a terminal.\n\nLet me try to think reverse: start from the string and see if it can be reduced by the grammar rules.\n\nEach rule in the grammar either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first step would be to look for any production that results in the terminal part of the string. For example, t75 is produced by NT32. So perhaps the first step of the derivation is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would generate t75 followed by whatever NT14 expands into.\n\nSo the string starts with t75, which would correspond to NT32. Let's see what comes next. The next token is t49. Looking at the grammar, t49 is produced by NT1. So NT32 \u2192 NT1. Wait, let me check the grammar: NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5. So NT1 expands into two non-terminals. So perhaps after t75, the next part comes from NT1's expansion.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the first two tokens: t75 t49. Since t75 is NT32 and t49 is NT1, then S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the string after S would be the expansion of NT32 followed by expansion of NT14.\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75. So the first part is done. Now, NT14 expands into what? Looking at the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So NT14 is NT31 followed by NT21.\n\nSo after t75, we have NT31 and NT21. Now, let's see NT31. From the grammar, NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11, for example.\n\nWait, but the string after t75 is t49, which is NT1, so I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, the string is t75, t49, t40, etc. So after t75, t49 comes next. Perhaps the next non-terminal after NT32 is NT14, which is NT31 NT21.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to model the entire derivation. Let's consider the string as a sequence of terminals, and try to see if it can be built from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt75, t49, t40, t1, t68, t77, t69, t15, t15, t1, t63, t68, t1, t25, t69.\n\nLet's write this as a list:\n\n1. t75\n2. t49\n3. t40\n4. t1\n5. t68\n6. t77\n7. t69\n8. t15\n9. t15\n10. t1\n11. t63\n12. t68\n13. t1\n14. t25\n15. t69\n\nNow, let's consider the starting symbol S. The only production for S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first part should generate t75, which is NT32, and then NT14, which would be... Looking at the grammar, NT14 can be NT31 NT21, or perhaps other rules. Wait, in the given grammar, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. But in the string, the first token is t75, which is from NT32. So we should consider S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo the first part is t75, then the expansion of NT14.\n\nLooking at NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So after t75, the next two tokens should be from NT31 and NT21. But in the string, after t75 comes t49. So perhaps NT14 \u2192 t49? But wait, NT14 is a non-terminal, it must expand into other non-terminals until it becomes terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because the string is a linear list, and I'm not sure which parts are which. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of tokens: t75, t49, t40, t1, t68, t77, t69, t15, t15, t1, t63, t68, t1, t25, t69.\n\nNow, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first part is t75 (from NT32), and the second part is NT14, which must expand into something that starts with t49.\n\nWait, but the second token is t49, which is the expansion of NT14. So perhaps NT14 expands into t49 followed by something. But NT14 can be NT31 NT21, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe NT14 can be a terminal. But looking at the grammar, all NT rules seem to produce other non-terminals except for some that produce terminals. Wait, no, looking back, I see that some rules produce either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. For example, NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1, which is two non-terminals. NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT5, also non-terminals. NT15 \u2192 t71 or t35, or t21? Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I find:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34\nNT15 \u2192 NT29 NT20\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT15 \u2192 't35'\nNT15 \u2192 't21'\n\nWait, no, actually, in the given grammar, some rules for NT15 have terminals:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71' (I think that's a terminal)\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 't35' and 't21' are terminals.\n\nSo, NT15 can directly produce t71, t35, or t21.\n\nSo, in the context of the string, if somewhere we have t71,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t75 t69 t1 t78 t53 t69 t74 t43 t34 t69 t74 t69 t26 t78 t80 t15 t69`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of productions starting with NT and ending with 't' or without. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which suggests repeated non-terminals. But the string given has a bunch of 't' terms, which probably correspond to terminal symbols.\n\nThe main challenge is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The string starts with t75, so let's check the grammar for where t75 appears. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- `NT24 -> NT4 NT18` but also `NT18 -> t75`. Wait, NT18 -> t75. So t75 is the result of NT18.\n\nSo, the string starts with `t75`, which comes from NT18. So the first part is NT18 \u2192 t75. Then, looking further in the string, after t75 comes t69, which is another terminal. So we need NT18 to produce something that starts with t75 t69... But wait, in the grammar, NT18 doesn't directly produce anything except through another non-terminal. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see an NT18 production except in some cases where it's part of a larger non-terminal. Wait, actually, the production for S is S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So S can derive into NT18 NT32, which then can be further broken down if NT18 and NT32 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first part is t75 t69 t1..., which would have to come from S. So let me consider S's productions.\n\nS can go to NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So let's see:\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then NT32 is a non-terminal. But in the string, after S comes t75, which is the production from NT18. So maybe the initial S uses the NT18 production? Or perhaps NT32 can lead to t75 somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me try to approach it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t75 t69 t1... Let's consider how each 't' is produced.\n\nt75: From the grammar, NT24 \u2192 t75 via NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT18, but wait, NT18 \u2192 t75. Hmm, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t75: So NT18 directly produces t75. So t75 is from NT18.\n- Then, in the string, next is t69. So after t75 comes t69. So perhaps we have some production where NT18 is followed by NT24, which produces t69?\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe NT18 produces t75, and there's another NT that produces t69 which is connected to it somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for production sequences that can lead to the given string. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 t75\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' via NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT24 \u2192 t75? Wait, let me check the productions.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach. Since the string is a series of 't's, I can model each 't' as a terminal resulting from a specific non-terminal. So I can map each 't' in the string to the corresponding production.\n\nLet's list the 't's in the order they appear:\n\n1. t75\n2. t69\n3. t1\n4. t78\n5. t53\n6. t69\n7. t74\n8. t43\n9. t34\n10. t69\n11. t74\n12. t69\n13. t26\n14. t78\n15. t80\n16. t15\n17. t69\n\nEach 't' corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar that produces that terminal. For example:\n\n- t75: from NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT18, and then NT18 \u2192 t75. Wait, actually, looking up, I think NT24 has a production NT24 \u2192 t75. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT24 -> t75? Or is it part of a longer production? Let me go through the grammar:\n\nWait, I need to parse the grammar correctly. It's a bit long, but let me list the relevant productions where 't's appear as results:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> t1\n- NT17 -> t1\n- NT18 -> t75\n- NT25 -> t68\n- NT24 -> t75? Or does it produce other ts? Wait, for example, NT18 \u2192 t75, yes.\n\nI think I need to map each t to the non-terminal that produces it.\n\nSo for the string:\n\n1. t75: comes from NT18\n2. t69: possible from NT0, as NT0 \u2192 t69 in some productions, or NT24 \u2192 t69, or NT18 \u2192 t75, etc.\nWait, in the grammar, looking through:\n\nWait, I think NT0 has productions that go to 't's, like:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT0 \u2192 t71\n- NT0 \u2192 t80\n- etc.\n\nAlternatively, NT24 has several productions leading to t75, t42, etc. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for t75:\n\nNT24 \u2192 t75 (if any). Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see a direct production of NT24 \u2192 t75. Instead, I see:\n\nNT24 produces things like NT14, NT22, and others. Let me check specific ones.\n\nLooking for t75:\n\nYes, here's a production: NT24 \u2192 t75. So NT24 can produce t75.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. So NT24 can produce t75 directly.\n\nSimilarly, let me check each occurrence:\n\n1. t75: NT24 \u2192 t75\n2. t69: I need to find a production where x \u2192 t69. Looking through, NT24 \u2192 t69? No. Looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT24 -> t69? Wait, let me look for 't69' in the productions.\n\nIn the productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t69 via NT24 \u2192 NT24 NT18, but that's a two-step production. Alternatively, perhaps NT0 \u2192 t69 is in the productions, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions for 'tX':\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t69: Yes, in the grammar, NT0 can produce t69, I think.\n\nLooking back to the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't69' in the productions:\n\nYes, in NT0 \u2192 t69.\n\nSo t69 comes from NT0.\n\nSo, back to the string: t75 t69. So that would be NT24 \u2192 t75, and then NT0 \u2192 t69.\n\nBut in the grammar, S produces combinations of non-terminals. So perhaps S \u2192 NT24 NT14, and then NT24 can produce t75, and NT14 can produce t69.\n\nWait, let's think: the first part of the string is t75 t69... So let's assume that the first production is S \u2192 NT24 NT14, which gives us two non-terminals, NT24 and NT14. Then, NT24 can produce t75, and NT14 can produce t69.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT24 NT14 \u2192 t75 t69...\n\nBut let's check what NT14 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT14 is in several productions, including:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 t43\n\nYes, because in the grammar, NT14 can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-298","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string belongs to the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies parsing algorithms.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that some of the productions have three non-terminals on the right side. For example, S -> NT32 NT14. Wait, but in CNF, each production should only have two non-terminals at most. So is this a correct CNF grammar? I think I might have made a mistake here because the initial production S has two non-terminals, which is fine, but some others have three, like NT24 -> NT4 NT2 or NT24 -> NT12 NT24. Hmm, that seems like it's not in CNF because those have more than two non-terminals on the right side. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, maybe the user provided the grammar incorrectly or perhaps it's in a different form. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo. But regardless, I have to proceed with the given grammar and the string to evaluate.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t75 t69 t1 t26 t1 t1 t77 t69 t15 t15 t26 t1 t82 t1 t1 t26 t69`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of several 't's followed by numbers, but the exact structure is a sequence of these tokens. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI should start by analyzing the top-level productions. The start symbol is S, and the productions are:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, S produces either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't75', which I need to match against the productions. Let's see which NT could lead to 't75'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see a few NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77'\n- NT24 \u2192 't12'\n- NT25 \u2192 't64'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT6 \u2192 't53'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' or 't70'\n- NT22 \u2192 't25'\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT23 \u2192 't21'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT20 \u2192 't26'\n- NT15 \u2192 't68', 't29', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't71'\n\nSo, 't75' can only come from NT32 \u2192 't75', which is straightforward. Therefore, the first token 't75' must come from NT32 expanding into 't75'.\n\nSince S starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the first production after S is NT32 followed by NT14. So, after 't75', the next token is 't69', which is part of NT14.\n\nWait, let's look at NT14: NT14 \u2192 't43' in some productions, but I'm not sure. Wait, looking back, in the NT productions, I see NT14 has several possibilities, but looking closely, in the initial part, does it have a direct production for 't69'? No, perhaps I'm mixing it up.\n\nWait, actually, let me re-check the NT productions to see where 't69' comes from. From the NT31 production, NT31 \u2192 't69' is one of the options. So, when I see 't69' in the string, it's because NT31 produced it.\n\nBut how is that linked back to S? Let me see:\n\nS can produce S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nIf the first token is from NT32 \u2192 't75', then after that, the next is 't69', which is from NT31 \u2192 't69', so that implies that after NT32, we have NT32 producing 't75' and then something else, but in the S production, it's NT32 followed by NT14. So perhaps after 't75', the NT14 must produce 't69'.\n\nWait, but looking at NT14, do any of its productions lead directly or indirectly to 't69'? Let me check: \n\nLooking at NT14's productions: \n- NT14 \u2192 't43' (does it appear so? Let me scan the list: no, the direct productions might be more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by backward parsing. Let me see the last tokens and see if I can build a possible derivation.\n\nBut in any case, the string starts with 't75 t69...', so S must first go to NT32 NT14, which expands to 't75' followed by something that produces 't69' eventually.\n\nBut wait, the string is 't75 t69...', which would require that after NT32 produces 't75', the next NT, which is NT14, must produce 't69'. So, does NT14 have a production that ends with 't69'? Or more likely, is there a sequence in NT14 that results in 't69'?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way: maybe after NT32 \u2192 't75', NT14 somehow leads to 't69' through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but looking at NT14's productions, I can't find an immediate production that leads to 't69'. Let me scan the NT14 productions:\n\nLooking back, the NT14 productions are:\n- NT14 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 't40' (from NT14 \u2192 NT1 (\u2192t6?), wait I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the NT14's possibilities again. Wait, in the initial query, it seems that some NT14 have 't43', 't46', etc. But none of the NT14 seem to directly produce 't69' except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Looking at NT24's productions: in some cases, it's NT24 \u2192 NT25 NT10, which is 't77' and 't40' (from NT25 \u2192 't64')? Or maybe I'm mixing terminals with non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should step through the entire string step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be generated by following the grammar rules. Let me try to see the structure.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nGiven that the string starts with 't75', which comes from NT32 \u2192 't75', the next step is to process NT14, which must produce the next part.\n\nSo, after 't75', the next token is 't69', which should come from NT14 producing... But looking at NT14's productions, I don't see 't69' directly. So maybe I'm wrong about NT14 producing 't69'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S could be expanding to S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which would produce the first two tokens as 't...'.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't75', which we know comes from NT32. So the first production must be S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so the first part is okay, 't75'.\n\nNow, after 't75', we have 't69' from NT14. So we need to see if NT14 can produce 't69' after generating 't75'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for 't75' and see what comes after. Or maybe to process the string step by step based on the NT productions.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for sequences that are possible, like trying to find a way to produce the entire string.\n\nAnother thought: in context-free grammars, each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals according to the allowed productions.\n\nGiven that the string is 't75 t69 t1 t26 t1 t1 t77 t69 t15 t15 t26 t1 t82 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it has specific rules that might make parsing easier.

Chomsky normal form typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that every production seems to be of the form NT followed by two other NTs or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and then NT32 \u2192 NT3 NT30, and so on.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't75', 't26', etc. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions in some order.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree for the string should be a full binary tree where each node has exactly two children, except for the leaves, which are terminals. So, the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the depth of the parse tree. Let's count the number of tokens in the string. \n\nThe string has the following tokens: t75, t26, t28, t78, t22, t69, t21, t46, t71, t69, t74, t77, t63, t43, t1, t69, t74, t69. Let's count them: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Wait, actually, the string has 17 tokens. That's an odd number, but since the grammar starts with two symbols (like S \u2192 NT something), the number of symbols would be a power of two. Wait, 17 is 2^4 + 1, which is not a power of two. So according to Chomsky normal form, the length of the string should be 2^n, so a power of two.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Chomsky normal form allows for S \u2192 a, which is a single terminal, but in CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The maximum length of a string in n steps is n+1. To have the entire string, it's structured such that the length is a power of 2. For example, with S starting, after one step, it can produce two terminals, then after two steps, four, then eight, etc. So the total string length for S must be 2^n, which is a power of two. \n\nLooking at our string, there are 17 't's, which is not a power of two (2^4=16, 2^5=32). So the string length is 17, which is not a power of two. Therefore, this string cannot be generated by a grammar in Chomsky normal form because the maximum length would have to be a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows other configurations, but since it's in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals or a terminal. Starting from S, which is non-terminal, each step would add two symbols until you get terminals.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help because any reduction would result in a sequence of terminals eventually.\n\nFirst, let me write down the string to look at it: t75 t26 t15 t1 t78 t80 t1 t77 t69 t46 t71 t68 t43 t53 t52 t69 t69 t69. It's a series of terminals, so I need to see if these can be derived starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only productions are from S, which branches into NT14 or NT32. So let's see what these lead to.\n\nStarting with S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. Wait, the NTs might be non-terminals that expand into more symbols. Let's check what NT14 can generate.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT14 has two productions: NT14 -> NT31 NT21 and NT14 -> 't71'. So when we reach NT14, we can either stop there (if we take the 't71'), or expand further. Similarly, NT32 has a production NT32 -> NT2 NT22, and NT2 has several productions like NT2 -> NT22 NT15, which then can lead to NT15 or other NTs.\n\nThe string starts with t75, which I see is a terminal. Let's find where 't75' comes from. Looking through the grammar, NT23 produces t75. So that suggests that somewhere in the derivation, NT23 must have generated 't75'. \n\nLet me check the productions of NT23. Looking through the grammar, NT23 -> 't34' and NT23 -> 't21' and others, but no, wait, no. Wait, I see in the grammar: NT23 -> 't34', 't21', 't20', 't34' again, etc. Wait, no, hold on. Checking the grammar for NT23, I see it has several productions:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT23 -> 't21'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT23 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT23 -> 't20'\n- NT23 -> 't20'\n\nWait, no: looking back, the user's provided grammar is quite extensive. Let me re-examine the provided grammar to find where NT23 leads.\n\nIn the user's grammar, I see:\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT23 -> 't21'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT23 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't20'\n\nSo NT23 can produce any of those terminals.\n\nIn the string, the first token is t75. Wait, but none of NT23's productions result in t75. So that's a problem because t75 isn't an output of NT23. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the string can't come from the grammar starting from S because the first token would require NT23 to produce t75, which it doesn't do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have misread the grammar. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules provided, I don't see any NT that produces t75. So that's confusing because the string starts with t75, which isn't present as an output from any NT. That would mean the string can't possibly be in the language because there's no way to produce t75 from S.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Let me look again. The user provided a list of NT productions, and I need to find one that produces t75, which I don't see. So that would mean the grammar doesn't produce any t75. Therefore, the string starting with t75 is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t75 comes from S. But S's productions are NT32 NT14, etc., so S can't directly produce t75. Therefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait another thought: could t75 be a result of non-terminals? Are all NTs only producing terminals? No, in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals or a single terminal. So all NTs only produce terminals. Since S is a non-terminal that produces NTs (non-terminals), the entire derivation will eventually result in a sequence of terminals, but the first terminal in the string is t75, which isn't present in any NT production. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nSo I'm pretty confident that because the string starts with t75, which isn't an output of any NT, it can't be generated by this grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. The start symbol here is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32.

Since `t75` comes from NT32, I need to see how S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. \n\nSo let's assume the first part is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, the first symbol `t75` is from NT32. So now I have to see how the rest of the string matches this.\n\nWait, the string after the first symbol is `t1 t75 t19 t15 t1 t77 t69 t77 t69 t77 t1 t26 t77 t69 t49 t3 t69 t69`. \n\nWait, hold on. The initial symbol is `t75`, which is from NT32. Then the next symbol should be NT32's production. Let me check what NT32 can produce. Looking back, NT32 \u2192 't75' or NT32 can go further? No, looking at the grammar, NT32 has the production NT32 \u2192 't75' and perhaps another production? Wait, looking at the list, NT32 has S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32, but also NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, etc. Wait, no, NT32 has a production NT32 \u2192 't75' and also NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, etc. Wait, looking back at the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions provided, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT23 -> 't21'\n- NT29 -> 't28'\n- NT24 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't68'\n- NT19 -> 't1'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't71'\n- NT32 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't80'\n- NT12 -> 't78'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't49'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT2 -> 't49'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT17 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't74'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT24 -> 't12'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT30 -> 't63'\n- NT27 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't65'\n- NT33 -> 't52'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT25 -> 't64'\n- NT24 -> 't79'\n- NT0 -> 't31'\nWait, no, looking back, it says:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, some of which are terminals and some non-terminals. Let me make a list of the non-terminals and their possible productions so I can refer to them.\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' (only terminal)\n- NT15 \u2192 't68', 't15', or 't35' (wait, looking at the user's input, it's: NT15 -> 't71', NT15 -> 't35', and other productions like NT15 -> NT23 NT34, etc.)\n- Similarly, NT23 can produce 't34' or 't21', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nBut given the length, maybe I can find a pattern. The string starts with `t75`, so that must come from NT32. Then the next symbol is `t1`. So after NT32, which is 't75', we have a `t1`. Let's see, NT32 can produce 't75', but do any of the non-terminals produce 't1' as a terminal? Looking through the list:\n\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT23 -> 't34', etc.\n\nSo if after NT32 (which produces 't75'), we get a terminal 't1', which comes from NT7 or NT19. But in the grammar, these non-terminals might have other productions. For example, NT7 can produce 't1' or go further as NT23 NT17.\n\nSo if the string is `t75 t1...`, it's possible that after NT32, we have NT7, which is 't1'.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14: So the first symbol is 't75' (NT32). Then NT14 must produce the next symbol 't1'. So let's see what NT14 can produce. Looking through the productions for NT14, the user lists:\n\nNT14 -> 't43' and other productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar:\n\n- NT14 -> NT31 NT21\n- NT31 -> 't69', etc.\n\nSo NT14 can produce NT31 NT21. So 't43' is one option, but in the string, the next symbol is 't1', not 't43'. So perhaps S is using the other production.\n\nWait, the grammar has two productions for S: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the first part is either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. We've just considered the first production, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which starts with 't75' as NT32 and then NT14.\n\nBut NT14 can't directly produce 't1', as NT14's terminal production is 't43', which isn't the next symbol in the string. Therefore, this path doesn't seem to fit. Let's consider the other production for S: S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nIf S produces NT18 NT32, the string would start with NT18 and then NT32. Let's see what NT18 can produce.\n\nLooking up NT18: NT18 -> 't74', and perhaps other productions if any. I don't see any other productions for NT18 except the terminal 't74'. So NT18 must produce 't74' as a terminal. But in the string, the first symbol is 't75', not 't74'. Therefore, this production isn't matching the start. \n\nWait, that's a problem. The first symbol in the string is 't75', which can't come from NT18, as NT18 produces 't74'. So the only way to start with 't75' is via S \u2192 NT32 NT14. But within that, NT14 can't produce 't1' directly because its terminal production is 't43'. So perhaps there's another path for NT14 that involves terminal symbols other than 't43'.\n\nWait, let me check if NT14 has any other productions that can lead to 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-331","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit that structure.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t75 t53 t40 t69 t74 t46 t32 t77 t69 t19 t1 t1 t69 t74 t46 t84 t68 t32 t69`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, so each word in the string should correspond to a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the grammar has S producing either NT32 NT14 or NT30 NT14, etc. Wait, looking back, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32, among others. But in the string, I don't see 'T14' or 'T32' as terminals. Hmm, maybe those are part of longer productions.\n\nWait, looking closer, the rules have t75, t53, etc. So maybe the string's words correspond to the terminals in some productions that S can derive.\n\nLet me try to see the structure:\n\nThe string is quite long, but let's think about how S can expand. Starting with S, maybe it can expand into two non-terminals, which then expand further. Each of these steps would potentially add more non-terminals, until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the string given is 19 words long. That's a lot. Maybe I can look for the production rules that directly produce a t75, t53, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n- NT28 \u2192 NT0 NT25 (but 0 is a terminal)\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20\n- NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT1\n- And so on.\n\nWait, let's look for where the terminals are. There's t75, t53, t40, etc. Let me try to see if any non-terminals produce these.\n\nFor example, looking for \"\u2192 t75\" in any production. Scanning through the rules:\n\nI see:\n- NT32 \u2192 T75 T46\nWait, NT32 \u2192 t75 and t46. So, perhaps this is a production where NT32 goes to t75 and t46.\n\nLet me check that rule:\n\nYes, looking at the rules, I see \"NT32 \u2192 T75 T46\". So if NT32 is in the string, it would be replaced by t75 and t46, which are both terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals:\n\n- t53 appears in NT1 \u2192 t6 and something else? Wait, no, let's check:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t1\n- NT5 \u2192 t68\n- NT7 \u2192 t1\n- NT8 \u2192 t46\n- NT10 \u2192 t42\n- NT12 \u2192 t78\n- NT14 \u2192 t43\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n- NT18 \u2192 t74\n- NT19 \u2192 t1\n- NT20 \u2192 t26\n- NT22 \u2192 t3\n- NT23 \u2192 t21\n- NT24 \u2192 several options, including t72 and others.\n- NT25 \u2192 t64\n- NT27 \u2192 t77\n- NT28 \u2192 multiple options, including t82 and so on.\n- NT30 \u2192 t26 and others.\n- NT31 \u2192 several options, including t35 and others.\n- NT33 \u2192 t52 and others.\n- NT34 \u2192 t12 and others.\n- NT35 is a terminal (t35).\n- NT50 is a terminal (t50).\n- And others.\n\nWait, but looking for t75. Oh, right, in the string, we have t75 as the first word. So in the production rules, is there any non-terminal that produces t75? Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t80\n- NT12 \u2192 t78\n- NT20 \u2192 t26\n- NT24 \u2192 t72\n- NT31 \u2192 t35\n- NT32 \u2192 t75 t46\n- NT34 \u2192 t12 t1\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT15 \u2192 several rules, including t43, etc.\n- Oh, wait, I see \"NT0 \u2192 t71\" and \"NT0 \u2192 t84\".\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t21\n- NT24 \u2192 t72 t1\n- NT32 \u2192 t75 t46\n- NT33 \u2192 t52 t21\n- NT15 has rules like \u2192 t15 t71, \u2192 t15 t82, and so on.\n- Also, NT0 has a rule \u2192 t40, and others like \u2192 t23 \u2192 t34 \u2192 t12 t1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to try to generate the string step by step, starting from S and expanding until I get the string. But since the string is quite long, this might be tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string from right to left since the grammar is in CNF, and for CNF, the standard method to generate a string is to expand non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut maybe it's better to think in terms of leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the grammar is in CNF, each step either introduces a new non-terminal or replaces one with two terminals.\n\nLet's try to see what the string can represent.\n\nLooking at the first word, t75. From the rules, only NT32 produces t75 as part of a production. The rule is NT32 \u2192 t75 t46.\n\nSo the first part of the string must come from NT32, which is replaced by t75 t46, so the first two parts of the string would be t75 t46.\n\nBut in the string, after t75, the next is t53, not t46. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- Oh, I see \"NT24 \u2192 t72 t1\" and \"NT32 \u2192 t75 t46\".\n\nWait, the string starts with t75, so the first production must be NT32 \u2192 t75 t46.\n\nBut that would require the next part to be t46, but the string has t53. So that suggests that perhaps the first step uses another production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check again.\n\nThe string is: `t75 t53 t40 t69 t74 t46 t32 t77 t69 t19 t1 t1 t69 t74 t46 t84 t68 t32 t69` \n\nWait, so the first symbol is t75, second t53, third t40, etc. But if the first production is NT32 \u2192 t75 t46, then after t75 comes t46, but in the string, it's t53. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the initial symbol is derived differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S isn't just one NT32 but another production.\n\nLooking back, S has two main initial productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nLooking at these, let's see:\n\nIf the initial production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT32 and NT14 would each derive some strings.\n\nAlternatively, S could be NT18 NT32. Let's see which path fits the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can approach this by building possible leftmost derivations.\n\nBut before that, let me check if any non-terminal produces t53, as the second symbol in the string is t53.\n\nLooking through the rules, is there any non-terminal that produces t53 as a terminal?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces t53. Let me scan through all the rules again to make sure.\n\nThe rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t40, t23, etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t1\n- NT5 \u2192 t68, t19, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 t1, t78, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 t46,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t75 t22 t72 t78 t78 t3 t40 t1 t26 t15 t68 t69 t74 t68 t43 t46 t84 t68 t32 t69`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand the production rules. It seems complex with many non-terminals and terminals. Some non-terminals produce terminals like 't1', 't3', 't7', 't30', etc. Others produce other non-terminals.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar structure. For example, S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Then, these NTs can lead to terminals or more NTs. Since the string starts with 't75', I need to see which production could lead to that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that NT32 can produce 't32' (terminals like 't32' are produced directly by NT32). So if there's a chain that leads to NT32, perhaps that will produce 't32'.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't75'. Looking at the production rules, I see that NT30 can produce NT2 NT22 and NT24. Wait, let me see if there's a rule that leads to 't75'. I find NT27 -> NT77, which produces 't77', but 't75' is another terminal.\n\nWait, let's look for NT31 -> NT11 NT14, which then leads to 't11' (if NT11 produces 't11'). But NT11 also has other rules. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find if the string can be broken down into symbols derived from the grammar. Maybe I can work backwards, starting from the end.\n\nThe last part of the string is 't69 t32 t69'. Looking at the grammar, 't69' could come from NT23, which is given as NT23 -> 't69', or via other productions. Similarly, 't32' comes directly from NT32.\n\nI can try to see if the entire string can be mapped through the grammar. Let's list the symbols:\n\nt75, t22, t72, t78, t78, t3, t40, t1, t26, t15, t68, t69, t74, t68, t43, t46, t84, t68, t32, t69.\n\nI think it's helpful to build a parse tree or look for the sequence of symbols that could be generated from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at S, it can split into two parts, each producing a pair of NTs. For example, S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nEach of these NTs can be further split. Let's consider the first option, NT32 NT14. NT32 can produce 't32' directly. NT14 can produce 't43' directly or via other rules. So that would give us 't32 t43' as part of the string. But looking at the string, we have 't75 t22...', so that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with NT18 NT32. Let's see: NT18 and NT32. NT32 we know can produce 't32'. NT18 can produce 't18' or via other rules. But 't75' is the start, so perhaps another path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think about each symbol and see which productions could lead to them.\n\n- 't75' is produced by NT31 -> 't35' or 't75'? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT31 -> 't35', but also other rules. Wait, no, not 't75'. Or does any NT produce 't75'? Let me check. Looking through the production rules, I see NT24 -> 't75'? Let me look: Oh, yes! There's NT24 -> 't75', which is a terminal production. So if any NT24 is reached, it can produce 't75'.\n\nSimilarly, checking other terminals:\n\n- 't22' must come from some NT22. Looking at NT22, I see that it's a non-terminal that can produce other NTs or terms. Wait, in the grammar, NT22 is defined as NT22 -> NT22 NT15 or other rules? Let me find NT22 in the production rules: Oh, looking through, I see NT22 -> NT8 NT0 and others, but does any NT22 have a terminal production? Let's see: Looking for NT22 -> ..., I find that NT22 is produced by NT22 -> NT8 NT0 and NT22 -> NT3 NT18? Or maybe other rules? Wait, no.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production for NT22. Let me check again. From the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> NT8 NT0\nNT28 -> NT21 NT25\nNT24 -> NT31 NT6\n...\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any NT22 directly produces 't22'. Looking through all production rules, I don't see any. So 't22' must be from a terminal symbol, but in the grammar, the terminals are 't1' to 't84'. So 't22' must be directly by some NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. Looking for all NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT3 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT23 -> 't59'\nNT31 -> 't69'\nNT7 -> 't80'\nNT23 -> 't21'\nNT29 -> 't28'\nNT24 -> 't75'\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT28 -> 't28'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't80'\nNT12 -> 't78'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't49'\nNT17 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't28'\nNT2 -> 't49'\nNT30 -> 't26'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT17 -> 't82'\nNT10 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't74'\nNT23 -> 't19'\nNT22 -> ...

Let me look through all NT22 rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT22 -> NT22 NT15 and others, but no direct terminal. So 't22' can't be generated from the grammar, meaning the string is invalid.

Hmm, the string is `t75 t74 t77 t40 t46 t71 t42 t19 t40 t78 t40 t15 t42 t40 t1 t75 t6 t78 t69 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I think all the productions fit that form because each non-terminal on the left is either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string consists entirely of terminals, so each token in the string must be generated by a production that produces a single terminal. That means every non-terminal we use in the derivation must expand directly into a terminal.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Each of these must expand to a terminal string, so I need to see if NT32 and NT14 can produce t75 and t74 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT32, I see in the grammar that NT32 is not directly listed as a production that produces a terminal, so it must expand further. Let's see what NT32 produces: the productions starting with NT32 are NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, NT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6, and so on. It seems NT32 is part of a chain that eventually leads to a terminal. Let's trace NT32's possible expansion.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT32 isn't listed as a production; perhaps I'm getting confused. The initial production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So NT32 must be a non-terminal that can produce a terminal. Let me check the other productions for NT32. Scanning through, I don't see an explicit production for NT32 other than appearing in S. So perhaps NT32 is a non-terminal that can only produce certain things. Let me check the available productions involving NT32.\n\nWait, I don't see any productions that directly start with NT32 except in the initial production. So maybe NT32 is a non-terminal that only appears in S. Hmm, but since the string starts with t75, which is produced by NT32, I need to see if NT32 can produce t75.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions that produce t75 are NT15 \u2192 't75' and NT31 \u2192 't75' (I think; let me check). Wait, in the list, I see NT15 \u2192 't75' and other productions for NT15, but also NT31 in some other contexts. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't75'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't33'\n- NT15 \u2192 't28' (from one production)\n- Also, NT24 \u2192 't72', etc. Wait, let's get back.\n\nMaybe I should approach this by trying to build the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t75 t74 t77 t40 t46 t71 t42 t19 t40 t78 t40 t15 t42 t40 t1 t75 t6 t78 t69 t69.\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14. So NT32 and NT14 need to produce t75 and t74 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT14, in the grammar, I don't see any production starting with NT14 except in S. Wait, checking the grammar, NT14 has a production NT14 \u2192 't35' or something else? Let me search the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's NT14 \u2192 't43' and also in another part, NT14 \u2192 't31'? Not sure. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't75' and some others\n- NT14 is in S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Also, looking for NT14's productions, I see NT14 is used in production NT14 \u2192 't35' perhaps? Wait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the productions where terminals are used:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't75'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't33'\n- NT15 \u2192 't28' (Wait, no, let me see: I think it's NT15 \u2192 't28' and NT28 \u2192 't82' and so on. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that in the initial S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so each of these non-terminals must produce the corresponding t tokens. So let's see if NT32 can produce t75 and NT14 can produce t74.\n\nLooking for NT32's productions, I don't immediately see one that produces a terminal, but perhaps it's part of a chain that does. Let's try to see.\n\nWait, from the provided grammar, the productions for NT32 are not present except in S. So perhaps I need to look if NT32 can produce a terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT32 is a non-terminal that can only appear in the initial production, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I should check the productions for NT32 again.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I don't see any line starting with NT32 except S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So perhaps NT32 is a non-terminal that can only produce certain things. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking again, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the entire list:\n\nNo, each line starts with a rule like S -> ..., NT30 -> ..., etc. There's no NT32 except in S. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe NT32 is part of a production chain that can terminate in a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT15 \u2192 't75', and then going up, perhaps NT15 can produce t75, so NT15 is a non-terminal that can produce t75.\n\nSo if NT14 can produce t74, then S can produce these. But how? Because looking for NT14's productions, it's in S and maybe other places. Let's look for NT14's productions.\n\nIn the given grammar, I don't see a production for NT14 except in S and maybe another place. Wait, in the list, there is a production NT14 \u2192 't35' perhaps, but I'm not sure. Wait, checking: The list includes NT14 \u2192 't43'? Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check for each token in the string whether the corresponding non-terminal can derive it.\n\nLooking at the first token: t75.\n\nWhich non-terminals can produce t75? From the grammar, NT15 \u2192 't75' and also perhaps others. So NT15 can produce t75.\n\nSo perhaps the initial NT15 in S produces t75. Wait, but S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So for S to derive t75, NT32 would have to produce t75, and NT14 some other token. Wait, but that would be the case if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, with NT32 \u2192 t75 and NT14 \u2192 something else.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t75 and the second is t74. So if S's NT32 produces t75 and NT14 produces t74, then the first two tokens would be correct. But looking for NT14, can it produce t74?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT14 is used in two places: S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and perhaps another production elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT14 is present only in S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So perhaps NT14 can't produce any terminal directly except if it appears as a terminal in some production. Let's check the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT14 isn't listed except in S. So maybe the initial S must produce t75 and t74 through NT32 and NT14. But if NT14 can't directly produce a terminal, this approach might be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the grammar. Maybe NT32 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal. Let me look again for any production where NT32 is the left-hand side and produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I don't see anything like NT32 \u2192 't...'. All productions involve NT32 on the left, except S.

Now, the string to evaluate is: `t75 t1 t3 t77 t3 t77 t69 t74 t77 t26 t26 t15 t1 t82 t46 t84 t42 t78 t52 t69 t69`.\n\nBreaking down the string: it's a sequence of terminals. I need to see if this can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, note that terminals like 't75', 't77', etc., are specific to certain productions. For example, terminal t75 appears in NT2 \u2192 NT32. Looking back at the grammar, NT23 rules sometimes lead to t34 or others. \n\nLet me try to parse this string step by step.

{"custom_id":"request-371","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it means each production is either A->BC or A->a. Chomsky normal form typically has two terminals at the right-hand side or two non-terminals, but looking at the grammar, I see some right-hand sides have more than two symbols. Wait, no, actually, wait\u2014Chomsky normal form for context-free grammars allows productions to be A->BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A->a, where a is a terminal. So if the grammar includes longer strings, that's not strictly Chomsky normal form. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the rules, most have two symbols, like S->NT32 NT14, which is two non-terminals. But some have three, like NT31-> NT9 NT11 NT14, or NT24 -> NT27 NT20. That would mean the grammar is not in strict Chomsky normal form. Oh wait, in the problem statement, it says it's presented in Chomsky normal form, so maybe I'm misreading it. Alternatively, perhaps the given grammar is in a different form, but the problem says to assume it is Chomsky normal form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake, but for the sake of solving the problem, I have to take it as given. So the grammar is presented as a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, but looking at it, I see some productions have more than two symbols on the right-hand side. That's unusual because Chomsky normal form typically requires each production to have exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the user made a typo, but perhaps the grammar is actually in a different form, such as allowing productions with two or three symbols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, and the user intended it to be in Chomsky normal form with only two symbols per production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's an unrestricted grammar, but that seems unlikely since the problem refers to it as Chomsky normal form. I need to clarify this, but perhaps the grammar provided is correct as Chomsky normal form, which would imply each production has exactly two symbols. So I should check again.\n\nLooking at the first few rules:\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT4 -> NT25 NT6\nNT24 -> NT2 NT13\nNT2 -> NT22 NT15\nNT1 -> NT23 NT5\nNT24 -> NT30 NT2 (Here, two non-terminals, so that's okay)\nNT4 -> NT20 NT20\nNT6 -> NT24 NT12\nNT5 -> NT27 NT21\nNT5 -> NT19 NT17\nEtc.\n\nWait, all the productions seem to have exactly two symbols on the RHS, except some where I see more. Wait, looking closer, for example, NT31 -> NT9 NT11 NT14 has three symbols, which would violate Chomsky normal form. So perhaps the grammar provided is not in Chomsky normal form as I understand it. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different form, like Greibach normal form, where each production starts with a terminal.\n\nWait, but no, Greibach normal form allows the first symbol to be a terminal, followed by non-terminals, but Chomsky normal form requires each production to be two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user provided a grammar that is not in correct Chomsky normal form. However, I'm supposed to treat it as if it is, so perhaps I should proceed with that in mind.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the symbols. For example, looking at NT31 -> NT9 NT11 NT14: that's three non-terminals, which would mean this production is invalid for Chomsky normal form. So this suggests that the grammar is not in Chomsky normal form, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed anyway, assuming each production is two symbols, even if some look longer.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, actually, each production seems to have either two symbols or a mix. Wait, looking again: NT30-> NT3 NT30 has two symbols, NT4-> NT25 NT6 has two, NT24-> NT2 NT13 has two, NT2-> NT22 NT15 has two, NT1-> NT23 NT5 has two. Then NT24-> NT30 NT2 (two), NT4-> NT20 NT20 (two), NT6-> NT24 NT12 (two), NT5-> NT27 NT21 (two), NT5-> NT19 NT17 (two). Wait, actually, all seem to have two symbols except perhaps some with three.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken in some of these. Let me check each line carefully:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT14: 2, okay.\n- S -> NT18 NT32: 2, okay.\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30: 2, okay.\n- NT4-> NT25 NT6: 2, okay.\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT13: 2, okay.\n- NT2 -> NT22 NT15: 2, okay.\n- NT1 -> NT23 NT5: 2, okay.\n- NT24 -> NT30 NT2: 2, okay.\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT20: 2, okay.\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12: 2, okay.\n- NT5 -> NT27 NT21: 2, okay.\n- NT5 -> NT19 NT17: 2, okay.\n- NT22 -> NT8 NT0: 2, okay.\n- NT13 -> NT10 NT28: 2, okay.\n- NT28 -> NT28 NT28: 2, okay.\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT1: 2, okay.\n- NT31 -> NT9 NT11: wait, this is two, but in the user's input above it's written as NT31-> NT9 NT11 NT14. Wait, perhaps that's a typo, and it's really two symbols. So maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement had some lines where more than two symbols are present, but perhaps it's a typo. So perhaps the grammar is in Chomsky normal form except for a few lines, but perhaps I can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can proceed by building a parse tree for the given string and see if it can be derived using the grammar.\n\nThe given string is: `t75 t64 t53 t34 t68 t78 t69 t74 t78 t1 t15 t77 t69 t77 t17 t74 t82 t46 t40 t68 t69`.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions sometimes result in terminals like 't' followed by a number. So perhaps each production eventually terminates with a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, in the grammar, many non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals. For example, looking at NT31-> NT9 NT11. Then NT9-> NT21 NT7, etc. So the non-terminals resolve down to terminals, which can be 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSo perhaps each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal, building up the string step by step.\n\nGiven the string, which starts with 't75 t64 etc., perhaps we can start tracing back from the initial symbols.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar can produce NT32 NT14. So S = NT32 NT14.\n\nSo let's see if the string starts with 't75 t64 etc. Wait, first, the string starts with 't75 t64 t53 t34 ...'\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions:\n\nLooking for what can produce 't75': in the grammar, NT15 and NT31 have rules ending with 't'. For example, NT35->'t75', NT15->'t1', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar's right-hand side rules, I see:\n\nNT31->'t75' (Wait, checking the given rules, I see lines like NT15 -> 't71', NT15 -> 't35', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of grammar rules, but perhaps some of them are right-hand sides that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\nNT34 -> NT24 NT18: NT24 and NT18 are non-terminals, so that's two.\n\nNT9-> NT21 NT7: non-terminals.\n\nNT24 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in CNF, meaning each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32.

Let's check NT21. NT21's productions include NT28 \u2192 NT21 NT25. Hmm, no, NT21 itself doesn't directly produce t80. Wait, looking at the rules again, maybe I'm misaligning the tokens. Let's list the string again and see if I can parse it step by step.\n\nWait, the string starts with t75, which must come from NT32. Then the second part must be from NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, after NT32, the next part is NT31 and then NT21. But in the string, after t75 comes t80. So, if NT31 produces t80, does any rule produce t80? Looking at the rules, maybe not directly, but perhaps t80 appears in other places.\n\nWait, looking at the production NT8 \u2192 't46'. Is there a connection to t80? Alternatively, maybe the first part is NT32, which is 't75', and the next part needs to come from NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, the second token, t80, should be either NT31 or NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions: NT31\u2192 NT9 NT11; NT9\u2192 NT21 NT7; NT7\u2192 't1' etc. So, maybe t80 is part of a deeper derivation? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's approach this by considering the first part: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which starts the string with t75 (from NT32), then NT14 which is NT31 NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31 and NT21:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11.\nNT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7.\nNT21 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT28's production is various, but looking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28 is a possibility? But that's recursive and would produce multiple copies, not sure. Alternatively, NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT21. So, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to parse the string step by step, checking each token to see if it can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst token is t75. From S, first part is NT32 \u2192 t75, which is good.\n\nNow, second token must come from NT14, which is either NT31 or NT21.\n\nThe second token is t80. So, t80 must be a result of either NT31 or NT21. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT31's production: NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11. So, if NT9 produces something that leads to t80, but looking at NT9's production: NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7. So, that's two NTs, but t80 is a terminal. None of the rules end with 't80' except possibly NT72 or others, but wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 't72'. Not directly relevant. Let me check the NT's that produce t80. Wait, in the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't80' directly. Hmm. So, that's a problem. If the second token is t80, but neither NT31 nor NT21 produce t80, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Unless there's a way to derive t80 through a chain, but that seems unlikely because t80 isn't a terminal; it's a fixed string token.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are the NTs terminals or non-terminals? All the tokens in the string are like 't75', 't80', etc., and also some non-terminals like NT32, NT14, etc. So, in the string, 't' followed by a number are terminals, while NT names are non-terminals. So, the grammar's NTs are non-terminals, and the 't' tokens are terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token must be a terminal that comes from a non-terminal, not a non-terminal itself. Wait, no: in the grammar, NT32 is a non-terminal which can produce either 't75' or other non-terminals. So, in the string, the first token 't75' is acceptable because NT32 can produce it.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is 't80', which must come from NT14, which is a non-terminal. But wait, NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Neither NT31 nor NT21 produce 't80' directly. So, perhaps NT31 or NT21 can produce a string that leads to 't80' through some derivations.\n\nLet's see: NT31's production is NT9 NT11. NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7. NT7 \u2192 't1'. So, NT9 can only produce sequences involving NT21 and NT7, which lead to 't1's. Similarly, NT21's productions include NT28, which can produce multiple NTs, including NT7 and NT25. NT7 is 't1', as above.\n\nSo, if the second token is t80, which is a terminal, but the production for NT31 and NT21 don't directly lead to t80, then the string can't be generated. Because the non-terminals in NT14 can't produce t80 directly or through any chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I'm miscalculating the production steps. Let me think again: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. NT32 produces 't75'. NT14 is NT31 NT21. So, the string after the first token is followed by the two non-terminals NT31 and NT21. But the string's second token is 't80', which must come from either NT31 or NT21. Since neither of these produce t80, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the productions have intermediate steps. For example, if NT31 can expand into other non-terminals that eventually produce 't80'. But looking through the rules, I don't see a path from NT31 or NT21 to t80. NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 \u2192 NT21 NT7 NT11. NT7 is 't1', but that's a terminal. So, the string would include 't1's.

{"custom_id":"request-394","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see both types of productions. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is a production from a non-terminal to two non-terminals, and other productions like NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5 take non-terminals to other non-terminals. Additionally, some rules have terminals, like NT15 \u2192 't71' or NT23 \u2192 't34'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t75 t46 t19 t78 t80 t1 t77 t78 t43 t70 t15 t69 t74 t77 t69 t71 t71 t69 t74 t26 t69 t69`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar rules.\n\nIn CNF, the parsing process can be done using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not familiar with the exact steps, I'll try to approach this by building a parse tree or looking for possible derivations.\n\nLet me see the start symbol S. From the given grammar, S has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the first step is to consider that the string must start with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t75. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t75. Looking through the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 't35' and NT7 \u2192 't40' but not t75. Wait, no. Oh, wait: there's a rule NT31 \u2192 't35', but I don't see an NT31 \u2192 't75'. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT32 \u2192 't75' is defined. So, NT32 can produce t75. That's good. So, in the first production, if the first non-terminal is NT32, it can produce t75.\n\nSo, the first symbol t75 would come from NT32. Now, the next symbol is t46. Let's check if the second part of S's first production (NT14) can produce the remaining string.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT32 NT14 would split the string into [t75, t46, t19, ...] as two branches: NT32 and NT14. But I'm getting confused because in this approach, each symbol might have to be matched to specific non-terminals. Maybe I should look for a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the entire string can be generated by following the grammar's rules step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string's entire sequence can be covered by the given productions. Let's start from the beginning:\n\n1. The string starts with t75. Looking at the rules, NT32 can produce t75. So, the first part uses NT32, which produces t75.\n\n2. Now, the next non-terminal to consider is the second part of the first production, which is NT14. Looking at the rules, NT14 can produce t43, but t46 is next. Hmm, so maybe the first production (S \u2192 NT32 NT14) isn't applicable here because the second part would be NT14, which doesn't match t46. Maybe I need to consider the second production of S, which is S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The string starts with t75, which is from NT32, but the next part after t75 is t46. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is the correct choice, but then after NT32 produces t75, the next non-terminal is NT14. Does NT14 produce t46? Looking at the rules, I don't see NT14 producing t46. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT14 has several productions, but I don't see any that produce 't46'. For example, NT28 \u2192 t82, NT4 \u2192 various, but none to t46. So, perhaps S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is not the correct path. Alternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32 is the right path, as the first symbol is t75, but the second production starts with NT18, so let's see what NT18 can produce.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT18 producing anything except in a multi-symbol production. Let me check: NT14 is followed by production \u2192 't43' but the next symbol is t46, so perhaps this isn't the right path either. Maybe the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is correct, but I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the entire string to be covered by a sequence of productions. Let me break the string into parts and see if each part can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nThe string: t75 t46 t19 t78 t80 t1 t77 t78 t43 t70 t15 t69 t74 t77 t69 t71 t71 t69 t74 t26 t69 t69.\n\nLet me try to group these into sequences that match the productions.\n\nStarting with t75, which is from NT32.\n\nNow, according to S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the next part is NT14, which needs to produce the rest of the string: t46 t19 t78 t80 t1 t77 t78 t43 t70 t15 t69 t74 t77 t69 t71 t71 t69 t74 t26 t69 t69.\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT14 can produce 't43', but t46 is next. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe NT14 can produce longer strings. Let me check if NT14 has any productions that generate multiple symbols.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 NT32 NT21 (line 14: NT14 -> NT32 NT21). So NT14 produces NT32 and NT21. NT32 can produce t75, and NT21 can produce, let me see. Looking at the rules, NT21 \u2192 't69'. So, NT14 \u2192 NT32 NT21 would produce t75 t69.\n\nWait, but in the string after t75 comes t46, not t69. So that's a problem. So S \u2192 NT32 NT14 can't produce t46 next because the second part is NT14, which either produces 't43' or leads to t69 when it's the second production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I was wrong about S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Maybe the string starts with S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which would produce t75 as the first symbol. Wait, NT18? Let me check the rules to see what NT18 can produce.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT18 as a left-hand side except in S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Hmm, so perhaps NT18 can't produce t75. Because in the rules, NT18 only appears in the production rule, but not as a terminal. So perhaps I'm confusing the non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, NT18 might produce some terminal in another rule. Looking back through the rules, I notice lines like NT20 \u2192 't26', NT6 \u2192 't53', NT1 \u2192 't6', etc. But NT18 is present as a left-hand side only in S \u2192 NT18 NT32, so perhaps NT18 can't produce a terminal on its own. That would mean that the first symbol t75 must come from NT32, so S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is the correct production to start with.\n\nBut then, the second part (NT14) would produce t46, which isn't directly possible. So perhaps S \u2192 NT32 NT14 isn't the right way to go. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Maybe I should check if there's a way to derive the entire string by looking for all possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me see, for example, NT7 can produce 't1' (line: NT7 \u2192 't1'), and NT15 produces 't71' and 't82' and 't1' and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-412","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is: `t75 t74 t77 t69 t74 t1 t43 t34 t26 t1 t3 t77 t69 t84 t69 t74 t77 t69 t78 t1 t26 t74 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) works. CNF requires that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or something else. Wait, no, some of the productions include terminals on both sides. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT32 is fine, but some are like NT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18, which is also two non-terminals. However, I notice that in the provided grammar, there's a production like NT15 \u2192 't71' and NT15 \u2192 't35'. These are terminal-only productions, which are allowed in CNF. So, the grammar seems to be correctly in CNF.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate consists entirely of terminal symbols (all strings are named 't' followed by numbers). So, the starting symbol S must derive down to this string through a series of productions.\n\nI need to check if the string can be derived by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use methods like CYK algorithm or parse trees, but manually, this might be time-consuming. Another approach is to trace the possible derivation steps, starting from S.\n\nLooking at the initial productions of S:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, S starts with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Each of these are two non-terminals. The CYK algorithm processes tokens in a table, but since the string is long, it might be easier to list out the steps.\n\nLet me break down the string:\n\nt75, t74, t77, t69, t74, t1, t43, t34, t26, t1, t3, t77, t69, t84, t69, t74, t77, t69, t78, t1, t26, t74, t69.\n\nThat's 22 tokens. Each production in CNF produces two symbols, so a parse tree would have a depth of log2(n), but for manual checking, perhaps considering the structure.\n\nEach step would combine two symbols into one, so starting from leaves (terminals), grouping them into pairs, and checking if the parent non-terminals match.\n\nWait, but how? Each production is applied recursively. Alternatively, perhaps trying to find a parse tree from the string upwards to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by concatenating the results of two non-terminals at each level. Each non-terminal must produce a certain sequence.\n\nLet me see which terminal symbols correspond to which non-terminals. For example, t75 is from NT15, t74 is NT7, t77 is NT28, t69 is NT31, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules, many non-terminals point directly to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't71' or 't40' etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 't6'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT3 \u2192 't1'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68' or 't27'\n- NT6 \u2192 't18', etc.\n\nSo, some non-terminals produce single terminal symbols. Others produce combinations.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see what non-terminals could generate these terms.\n\nt75: Look up the rules for NT15. Oh, NT15 has several productions, but one is NT15 \u2192 't71' and another is NT15 \u2192 't35'. I don't see a production for NT15 \u2192 't75' directly. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the NT15 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, let me check NT15's productions. In the rules, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT15 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, but the provided grammar lists:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, but that's it. No production for 't75' from NT15. So maybe 't75' is from another NT.\n\nLooking back, for NT15, it also has:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT28 NT25 (Wait, no, looking at the rules, I think I see:\n\nLooking through all rules, I notice that NT24 \u2192 NT12 NT1, but that's not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT15 \u2192 anything else except two terminal productions.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t75. If t75 is a terminal, it's not being generated by any non-terminal except perhaps if a non-terminal directly produces it. But in the rules, I see that NT15 only goes to 't71' and 't35', so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the given rules for NT15 are:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n\nHmm, but in the string, the first token is t75. That suggests that either t75 is a non-terminal that produces t75, but I don't see such a rule. Or perhaps I'm miscounting the strings.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see what those produce.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, NT18 and NT32.\n\nLooking for the productions of NT18:\n\nFrom the rules, I don't remember NT18 having a production. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't68', NT11 \u2192 't49', NT20 \u2192 't26', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a table of all non-terminals that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\nWait, no, in the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't43'\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\nNT0 \u2192 't84'\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' \u2192 wait, let's check each rule:\n\nLooking at the given rules, to avoid missing any:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', NT15 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't56'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't68', NT5 \u2192 't27', NT5 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't18', NT6 \u2192 't27'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40', NT7 \u2192 't68'\n\nWait, no, looking through, some have multiple production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a mapping of NT to terminals they can directly produce. \n\nSo, from the given rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't12', NT24 \u2192 't42'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't40', NT7 \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't22', 't70', 't80', 't59', 't34' etc.\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-420","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which simplifies parsing.\n\nFirst, the string is: `t75 t78 t43 t34 t1 t77 t69 t74 t69 t46 t43 t71 t49 t1 t74 t40 t3 t42 t19 t42 t69 t69 t69`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the starting symbol is S, and the productions start with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Each of these involves non-terminals, so I'll probably need to break this down step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't75', which, looking at the grammar, corresponds to NT32. That makes sense because in the grammar, NT32 is a start, but in the string, 't75' is a terminal derived from NT32. Let me check the grammar for NT32.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT32 has two productions: NT32 \u2192 NT75 and NT32 \u2192 t75. Since the first character is 't75', that must come from the production NT32 \u2192 t75. So that's the first step: S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and then NT32 \u2192 t75. So the string starts with the result of that production.\n\nNext, the string after t75 is t78. Let's look for where 't78' comes from. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT20 \u2192 t78. So 't78' must come from NT20. Checking the grammar for NT20, it has two productions: NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7, and NT20 \u2192 t78. So to get 't78', the production NT20 \u2192 t78 is used.\n\nBut wait, S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and after NT32 is t75, which is correct. Now, the next part is after t75, which is t78. So after S, we have NT18 and NT32. So, what produces t78? It must be NT20, so we need to get to NT20 from somewhere.\n\nWait, let me retrace. The string starts with t75, which comes from NT32. Then after that, the next part is t78. So let's see what's after T75 in the string. The string is t75 followed by t78, so it's two separate tokens. So the first two tokens are t75 and t78.\n\nSince t75 is NT32 \u2192 t75, then after that, we have to produce t78, which must come from NT20 \u2192 t78. So that means in the derivation, after S \u2192 NT18 NT32, we have to have a path where one of NT18 or NT32 or their expansions lead to t78. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because t75 is from NT32, and then the next token is t78 from NT20.\n\nSo perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which becomes NT18 followed by NT32. Then, each of these can expand further.\n\nWait, let's think step by step. The initial string is t75 t78 t43 t34 t1 t77 t69 t74 t69 t46 t43 t71 t49 t1 t74 t40 t3 t42 t19 t42 t69 t69 t69.\n\nFrom S, it's NT18 and NT32. Let's see:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT18 NT32 (since in the grammar, S has this production)\n2. Now, NT18 can expand further. Looking at NT18's productions, there's NT18 \u2192 t78, or does NT18 have more? Wait, looking back, I don't see NT18 \u2192 something else except in the grammar, I think NT18 only has one production: NT18 \u2192 t78. So that would mean NT18 \u2192 t78.\n\nWait, no, from the grammar, NT18 is only present in S's production. Let me check: S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Are there any other productions for NT18? Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT18 having any other productions beyond S's. So NT18 must directly expand to t78.\n\nBut in the string, after t75 (from NT32), comes t78. So that would mean that after the initial S \u2192 NT18 NT32, we take NT18 \u2192 t78 and NT32 \u2192 t75. But wait, the first token is t75, which is from NT32, so NT32 \u2192 t75, and then NT18 needs to produce t78. But is that possible? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and then NT32 \u2192 t75, but then where does NT18 come into play? Wait, no, the string is t75 followed by t78. So first t75 is from NT32, and the next t78 is from NT20, which suggests that after NT32 \u2192 t75, there's another part where NT18 (from S's NT18) somehow leads to another expansion that gives t78.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, and NT32 \u2192 t75, then NT18 \u2192 something else that ends with t78. But in the grammar, NT18 is only present in S's production and nothing else, right? Looking again, I think that after S \u2192 NT18 NT32, NT18 can only produce t78, not anything else. So the expansion would be t78 t75, but the string is t75 t78, which is the opposite order. That suggests that maybe the initial choice is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for Leftmost Derivation. So starting with S, the first step is to choose which production to apply. If we choose S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then we start with NT18, which must produce t78, and then NT32 must produce t75. But that would give us t78 t75, which doesn't match the string.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose the other production S \u2192 NT18 NT32, so same thing. Wait, no, the other production is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which is the same as the first one. Wait, maybe it's a typo, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, the grammar says:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S can go to NT18 NT32 or NT32 NT14.\n\nWait, wait, the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and the second is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So when expanding S, the first alternative is NT32 NT14, and the second is NT18 NT32.\n\nSo depending on which is chosen, the expansion could be different. Let's see. Suppose we choose S \u2192 NT18 NT32, which would give us NT18 followed by NT32. Then, both of these would need to produce terminals.\n\nBut from our earlier observation, NT18 only has the production NT18 \u2192 t78, so that would generate t78 immediately. Then, NT32 can produce t75. So that would give us t78 t75, but the string starts with t75 t78.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose the other production S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so NT32 followed by NT14. Then, we'd have to see how NT32 and NT14 expand.\n\nSo NT32 has two productions: nt32 \u2192 NT75, which is equivalent to producing t75. So that's good, giving us t75.\n\nThen, NT14 has two productions: nt14 \u2192 t43 or nt14 \u2192 t46.\n\nLooking at the string, after t75 comes t78. So the next token is t78. So if after nt14 producing t78, that's possible only if nt14 \u2192 t46 and then t46 is somehow transformed. Wait, no, nt14's productions are t43 and t46. So t78 is not a direct production of NT14, so that doesn't fit.\n\nSo perhaps the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT18 NT32, giving t78 and t75. But that doesn't match the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-433","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t75 t69 t43 t59 t43 t78 t49 t26 t15 t15 t77 t28 t3 t82 t77 t69 t77 t69 t69 t21 t26 t69 t74 t69`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all productions are either to two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT32 is in CNF, as is NT32 \u2192 NT3 NT32, etc.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the given grammar. It looks quite extensive, with non-terminals and terminals. Each rule either splits into two other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 't1' or NT5 \u2192 't68', etc. \n\nNow, looking at the string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols (like t75, t69, etc.), separated by spaces. The goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions of the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I might use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing context-free grammars. However, since the problem gives a specific string, I should perhaps try to break it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string by building a parse tree from left to right, using the productions. Let's consider the structure of the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't75 t69 t43 ...'. I know that in the grammar, 't75' appears as the right-hand side of NT3's production: NT3 \u2192 't1' or 't75'. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't1'\n\nHT3 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't6'\n\nBut in the string, we have 't75 t69 ...'. Looking through the grammar, 't75' is the terminal for NT3, and 't69' is part of NT7's production. Wait, no, looking at the grammar rules, NT31 is 't69', and NT0 is also 't69'. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't82'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't75'\n\nBT2 is 't75', which seems to be the production for NT3.\n\nWait, looking for 't75' in the grammar. The productions for NT3 are NT3 \u2192 't1', as in the grammar, starting from NT3. So how is 't75' generated? It's listed as the terminal for NT3, so NT3 \u2192 't75'.\n\nSimilarly, 't69' appears in multiple places. Looking through, 't69' is the terminal for NT23.

I'm a bit nervous because it's about context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form, and the string to check is quite long. But I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. It's a bit complex with all those non-terminals and terminals in the productions. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which fits the Chomsky normal form. So, my task is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is `t75 t53 t3 t26 t1 t15 t15 t3 t69 t78 t6 t26 t15 t77 t69 t42 t32 t35 t69 t69 t21 t69 t74 t69`. It's a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nHmm, maybe it's best to start by identifying the possible paths each terminal can take based on the grammar. Since the string starts with t75, I should look for a production for some non-terminal that can derive t75 directly. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 -> t3 and NT24 -> t75. So, the start symbol S can produce NT32 and NT14. Wait, let me check the start rule: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, S translates to NT32 followed by NT14.\n\nBut in the string, the first term is t75, which might come from NT24 \u2192 t75. But how does NT24 get to t75? Let me see. Looking at the productions, I see NT24 -> NT27 NT10. So, to get t75, we need NT24 \u2192 t75. Wait, no, NT24 \u2192 t75 isn't a production. I think I'm mixing up; looking back, each production is either a non-terminal split or a terminal. So, in the grammar, are there any productions where NT3 \u2192 t3 or a non-terminal that leads to t3? Wait, I think NT3 \u2192 t3 is provided: yes, in the grammar, NT3 -> t1. Wait no, looking again: the grammar has NT3 -> t1. Wait, no:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't1'\n\nSimilarly, NT15 has several options, including 't15'. Let me check.\n\nWait, I need to see which non-terminals can derive each terminal.\n\nWait, the structure is a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to try to parse the string from the start.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terms, each being a terminal token. In context-free grammars, the derivations lead to the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as we go.\n\nLet me try to structure this.\n\nThe entire string is t75 t53 t3 t26 t1 ... up to t69 multiple times.\n\nI need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar starting from S. So, starting from S, which produces NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the first token must be derived from NT32, and the second from NT14.\n\nSo, looking at the beginning of the string: the first token is t75. So, is t75 derivable from NT32? Let's see NT32 productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a few places where NT32 appears:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t1,\n\nNT0 \u2192 t19, t35, etc., but NT32 \u2192 t75 is the key.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through all the NT32 productions:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n\nBut that's a production for NT30, not NT32.\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75: yes, in the grammar, I see \"NT2 \u2192 NT23 NT17\", etc., but looking specifically, I see \"NT24 \u2192 't75'\", which is a production NT24 \u2192 t75. Wait, no, looking at the end:\n\nLooking for NT32:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\nS -> NT32 NT14\nAlso, looking through all the productions, I can see that NT32 is used in NT7 \u2192 t40, which doesn't make sense because I don't see NT32 \u2192 t75 explicitly. Wait, let me find it.\n\nWait, I see a production for NT31: NT31 -> 't69', and also NT24 -> 't75'. Wait, no, looking through all the lines:\n\nI see that NT15 -> 't15' is one line, which isn't directly helpful. Wait, wait, I see that:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal A \u2192 t75, I see that NT24 \u2192 t75.\n\nSo, in the grammar, there is NT24 \u2192 t75. But in the start rule, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, so the first part is NT32. So, does NT32 produce t75? Or does it produce NT24, from which t75 can be derived.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a production NT24 \u2192 t75? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the grammar, there's a production for NT24 \u2192 t75? Wait, looking through all lines:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT24 -> t72\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see multiple entries, but looking for NT24:\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nThe first few lines are S -> NT32, S->..., NT30 -> ..., NT4 -> ..., etc.\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nWait, maybe that's a typo? Wait no, in the provided lines, it's:\n\nNT15 -> 't71', NT15 -> 't35', NT15 -> 't15', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a line. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the NT24 productions:\n\nYes, there's \"NT24 -> NT4 NT1\". But I don't see an explicit production of NT24 \u2192 t75. Or wait, is there any line where NT24 produces t75? Let me see.\n\nWait, I see NT24 -> 't72' is one of the productions. But in the provided list, let me check:\n\nHere are some lines:\n\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT1\n- NT24 -> NT27 NT21\n- NT24 -> NT24 NT10\n- NT24 -> NT17 NT30\n- ... (other lines)\n\nWait, looking for 't75' in the grammar, I don't see any line where a non-terminal goes directly to t75 except possibly where? Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the first few lines, I don't see NT32 \u2192 t75. Wait, no, the first line is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. But maybe NT32 can be expanded to something else.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT32:\n\nI see this line: NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n\nAnd another line: NT32 \u2192 NT24\n\nWait, yes, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24\n\nWait, looking through the lines:\n\nYes, \"NT32 \u2192 NT24\".\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT32 NT14 can expand to NT24 NT14.\n\nThen, the next token in the string is t53. So, from NT24, can we derive t53? Wait, do any non-terminals produce t53?\n\nLet me check the grammar again for any production where A \u2192 t53.\n\nLooking through, I see NT24 \u2192 NT17 NT30, but no t53 there. Wait, perhaps NT15 \u2192 t53? I don't think so. Wait, in the grammar, NT25 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, let me look:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal goes directly to t53.\n\nI see that NT25 \u2192 t53.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, is there a rule where NT25 \u2192 t53?\n\nLooking through:\n\nI see NT24 \u2192 t72 from a line.\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the first few lines, I see:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n\n- S -> NT18 NT32\n\nThen:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT6\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some lines.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. That should simplify things a bit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and the productions are rules like S -> NT32 NT14, etc. Each production right-hand side has either two non-terminals or, on some cases, a mix until I see the terminal symbols. Wait, no, actually looking closer, some productions have a mix of non-terminals and terminals? Or are all non-terminals? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, some productions have terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal symbol. So that means the grammar includes terminals, which are 't's followed by numbers. Each production's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or includes terminals.\n\nSo when parsing the string, whenever a terminal appears, it should match the corresponding production rule.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t75 t69 t43 t26 t78 t80 t80 t26 t15 t3 t68 t69 t26 t74 t77 t78 t46 t59 t74 t26 t15 t77 t1 t26 t69`.\n\nI think the approach is to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar, trying to derive the given string step by step. If I can successfully derive the string by expanding the non-terminals according to the rules, then the string is in the language.\n\nAlternatively, since this can be complex, I might use the Pratt parsing method or the CYK algorithm, but given that the grammar is in CNF, it's more manageable.\n\nWait, but let me see. Each production is in the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each step in the derivation reduces the string into non-terminals until the terminals match.\n\nSo for the given string, let's break it down:\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t75, t69, t43, t26, t78, t80, t80, t26, t15, t3, t68, t69, t26, t74, t77, t78, t46, t59, t74, t26, t15, t77, t1, t26, t69.\n\nI think the approach is to build the parse tree by recursively breaking down the string into components that match the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nSo the first two symbols should be derived from NT32 and NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t75. So is there a production where NT32 goes to t75?\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT32, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nWait, but looking back, the production for NT32 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22 (this doesn't produce a terminal)\nLooking through all the rules, is there any NT32 -> a terminal? Hmm, looking through, I don't see NT32 -> any terminal. Similarly, NT14 is used in the production. Let me check NT14.\n\nLooking for NT14 rules: I see NT14 -> NT31 NT21, and also NT14 -> 't43' somewhere else? Wait, no, looking through the rules, in the list, I see lines like:\n\nNT14 -> 't71'\nNT14 -> 't35'\n\nWait, yes, in the list, NT14 has multiple productions: one is NT14 -> 't71', another is NT14 -> 't35'. So 't71' and 't35' are terminals derived from NT14.\n\nSo for S -> NT32 NT14, the first symbol (t75) must be generated by NT32, which is a non-terminal, and the second symbol is t69, which would be generated by NT14.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t75, so NT32 must produce a derivation that starts with t75.\n\nLooking for NT32 productions. NT32 is defined as:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\n\nSo NT32 can only produce two non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol t75 must come from NT32, but since NT32 can't produce a terminal, it's impossible. Therefore, the string starts with t75, which can't be derived from NT32, so the string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I missed a production for NT32. Let me scan through all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any direct production for NT32 that ends with a terminal. For example, NT32 -> something that ends with a terminal. Only NT0, NT1, etc., have terminal productions. But I don't see NT32 directly going to a terminal.\n\nSo the production S -> NT32 NT14 implies that both NT32 and NT14 must produce at least two symbols each, which would mean that the string starts with two non-terminals, but the actual string starts with t75, which is a terminal.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the first token to be t75, since NT32 can't produce a terminal. So the string is invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t75 t43 t59 t69 t74 t69 t78 t40 t15 t15 t82 t43 t69 t21 t78 t40 t15 t77 t80 t69 t74 t77 t63 t69 t69`.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and see how the terminals appear. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several production rules that produce terminals like 't75', 't43', etc. Each production that results in a terminal like 'tX' allows us to track how these terminals can appear in the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't75'. Looking at the grammar, 't75' is produced by S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but also by some other rules for NT32 and NT14, but I'll get to that later.\n\nWait, actually, I need to see which non-terminals produce 't75'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT32 can produce 't75' because in the grammar, one of the rules for NT30 is NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, but that's a recursive production. I need to look for any production where 't75' is a result.\n\nLooking through, I see that in NT3 \u2192 't1', but that's part of another context. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking again, I see 't75' appears under NT32's production? Let me check.\n\nYes, there's a rule NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, that means NT32 can directly produce 't75'. So, the first token 't75' must come from NT32.\n\nNow, looking back at the grammar, S is the start symbol. Let's see how S generates NT32 NT14. So, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Since NT32 can produce 't75', and NT14 is another non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is 't75', so that comes from NT32. Then, the next part is 't43', which is 't43' in the string. So, after 't75', the next symbol is 't43'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, where can 't43' come from? Let's see. The productions that produce 't43' are... Wait, the grammar has a rule for NT14: NT14 \u2192 't43'. Also, NT4 can produce 't56', NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. But 't43' is directly produced by NT14.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT32 \u2192 't75' and then NT14 \u2192 't43'. So far, so good. Now, since the grammar is in CNF, each production must have two non-terminals. So, for S \u2192 NT32 NT14, each of these non-terminals must derive into a sequence of non-terminals, and eventually terminals, until the string is formed.\n\nBut in the string, after 't75' and 't43', the next is 't59'. So, after 't43', we have another 't59'. So, let's look at how 't59' can be produced.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that 't59' is not directly produced by any rule as a terminal. Wait, let me check. Hmm, looking through the list, there's a rule NT23 \u2192 't34', but 't59' is elsewhere. Wait, actually, looking again, I see NT0 \u2192 't71', NT23 \u2192 't21', etc. Maybe I'm missing the production for 't59'. Wait, in the grammar, one of the rules is NT23 \u2192 't34', another is NT24 \u2192 't72', but 't59' isn't listed. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT23, I don't see 't59' as a production. That's odd. Alternatively, maybe I missed it. Let me scan again.\n\nLooking through, I see NT23 \u2192 't34' and NT23 \u2192 't21', etc. Hmm, no 't59' production. So, how does 't59' get into the string? Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Maybe 't59' comes from another non-terminal that has a production leading to 't59'.\n\nWait, perhaps I can reconstruct the entire parse tree step by step to see if the string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each application of a production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must be directly produced by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nIn the string, after 't43' (from NT14), the next is 't59'. Since 't59' is not directly a production, perhaps we need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't59' as part of a larger derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar for any 't59' productions.\n\nLooking through the rules again, under the grammar, I don't see 't59' as a terminal production. That's a problem. So, either my initial assumption is wrong, or there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check the entire grammar again to be thorough.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT23 -> 't21'\n\nNo 't59' production. So, 't59' must come from a longer expansion, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production must be two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all terminals in the string must be directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nIf the grammar doesn't have 't59' as a production, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe 't59' can be a result of a longer expansion, but no, in CNF, each production can only have two non-terminals or one terminal.

S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo any derivation starting from S must consist of two non-terminals. But in the string, there are multiple 't' symbols. In CNF, terminal symbols would typically be leaves in the derivation, so each 't' in the string would correspond to a terminal produced by a non-terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, some rules produce terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't71', NT19 -> 't1', etc. But in the given grammar, the structure seems mixed because some non-terminals directly produce terminals, and others produce non-terminals. \n\nLet me think: In Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, we should have rules that produce terminals. But in the provided grammar, I see some rules where the right-hand side is a terminal, like NT15 -> 't71', NT19 -> 't1', etc. That makes sense because CNF allows terminals as the right-hand side. However, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nBut looking at the given string, it's a sequence of 't' symbols, which are likely terminals. So the question is whether the derivation can result in such a sequence. \n\nEach application of a grammar rule replaces a non-terminal with two new symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). So the string length would be 2^n where n is the number of times S has been expanded. Wait, no. The initial string is two symbols from S, then each step could increase the number of symbols. But in the given string, the length is 24 tokens. So the number of steps would determine the length. Hmm, but with multiple terminals, it's possible for the string to have a length that is not a power of two minus one. Maybe that's not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by looking at whether each terminal in the string is produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. For instance, each 't75' must come from a production that allows it, and so on.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of direct terminal productions. I can list them to see which 't's are allowed:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT6 -> 't53'\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT28 -> 't82'\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1' (again)\nNT28 -> 't82'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't80'\nNT12 -> 't78'\nNT20 -> 't26'\nNT9 -> 't49'\nNT17 -> 't68'\nNT13 -> 't28'\nNT2 -> 't49'\nNT30 -> 't26'\nNT21 -> 't69'\nNT17 -> 't82'\nNT10 -> 't42'\nNT18 -> 't74'\nNT23 -> 't19'\nNT22 -> 't3'\nNT14 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't40'\nNT24 -> 't12'\nNT24 -> 't42'\nNT30 -> 't63'\nNT27 -> 't77'\nNT17 -> 't65'\nNT33 -> 't52'\nNT29 -> 't62'\nNT25 -> 't64'\nNT24 -> 't17'\nNT17 -> 't25'\nNT8 -> 't46'\nNT0 -> 't32'\nNT24 -> 't79'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT31 -> 't35'\nNT19 -> 't15'\nNT23 -> 't70'\nNT31 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't53'\nNT1 -> 't6'\nNT0 -> 't84'\nNT13 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't56'\n\nSo each 't' in the string must be one of these specific terminals, right?

{"custom_id":"request-480","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like `t75 t49 t74 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal directly. So, looking at the given grammar, yes, it seems to fit CNF because every rule has two non-terminals on the right, except for cases where a terminal appears. Wait, some rules seem to have a mix, but in CNF, it's allowed to have a single terminal as the right-hand side of a production, but only as the start symbol. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check the grammar rules to ensure they conform strictly. For this example, I'll proceed assuming the grammar is correctly given as CNF for the sake of the problem.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is quite long: 25 tokens. Each token seems to be a terminal symbol starting with 't' followed by a number. I need to check if this string can be derived from the given grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive with multiple rules for each non-terminal. The string starts with `t75`, so I should find which production introduces 't75'. Scanning through the grammar, I notice `NT32 -> t75`. So, the first production must be S -> NT32 NT32 (wait, no, the grammar only gives two options for S: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. Oh, wait, that's two rules for S, so the string must start with either 't75' (from NT32) followed by 't49' (from NT14's production) or 't49' (from NT18) followed by 't75' (from NT32). \n\nWait, looking at the grammar: S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Each of these NTs has their own productions. Let's check:\n\nFor S -> NT32 NT14:\n- NT32 -> t75\n- NT14 can be NT31 NT21, NT31 is t69, 21 is t... Wait, NT21 is another non-terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT21's production is `NT21 -> NT34 NT17`. Hmm, maybe I should track the breakdown.\n\nAlternatively, S -> NT18 NT32:\n- NT18 might produce 't49', and NT32 is 't75'. So string starts with t49 t75, but the given string starts with t75 t49. So if the first production is S -> NT18 NT32, it would generate t49 t75. Since the string starts with t75 t49, that doesn't fit. Unless there's a way for NT32 to produce something else, but in the given grammar, NT32 only goes to t75.\n\nWait, but let me look again: I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, in the grammar, the first two S rules are S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So the two possibilities for S are NS32 followed by NS14 or NS18 followed by NS32.\n\nLooking at NS14: production is NS14 -> NT31 NT21. So if we take S as NS18 NS32, then NS18 -> t49, and NS32 -> t75, so the first two tokens would be t49 t75, but our string starts with t75 t49, which is t75 followed by t49. So that would mean the two tokens would need to be t75 then t49, which would require the first production to be NS32 NS14. So let's check:\n\nS -> NS32 NS14.\n\nNS32 -> t75\n\nNS14 -> NT31 NT21.\n\nNow, NS14's production is NT31 and NT21, both of which are non-terminals. So we need to expand those.\n\nNT31: Looking at the grammar, NT31 has a production to t69 (from NT31 -> t69), another production (NT31 -> NT9 NT11). Similarly, NT21 has production NT10 NT28, among others.\n\nWait, let's see. NT31's first production is to t69, so that might be a way to stop, but the string after t75 would need to be t49 t74 t77 t69 etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S starts with NS32 NS14, which is t75 followed by (NT31 NT21).\n\nSo after t75, the next symbols are t49, which is from NT18 (since NT18 is t49). But if we have NS14 as NT31 NT21, then the first production after t75 would be a non-terminal, not a terminal, which doesn't match t49, which is a terminal. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next symbol after t75 is another non-terminal, which can produce t49. Let me check the productions for NT31 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31:\n\n- NT31 -> t69 (terminal)\n- NT31 -> NT9 NT11\n\nIf NT31 -> t69, then after t75, the next token is t69, but the given string next is t49, which is a terminal. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if NT31 is expanded to NT9 NT11, then NT9's production is NT21 NT7, and NT11's production is NT20 NT19.\n\nWait, this might get too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe S is supposed to produce nt18 nt32, so t49 t75. But the string starts with t75 t49, which is the reverse. So that can't be, unless there's a way to switch the order through some rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after t75, the next non-terminal can produce t49 in another step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe the string starts with t75, which is from NT32. So after S->NS32 NS14, the next non-terminal is NS14, which must expand into a series of non-terminals leading to t49 and others.\n\nBut NS14 -> NT31 NT21. Let's check NT31 and NT21:\n\nNT31 can produce t69 or NT9 NT11. If it goes to NT9 NT11, then NT9 is NT21 NT7, and NT11 is NT20 NT19.\n\nWait, this is getting too deep. Maybe it's better to think about the sequence of tokens and see if they can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with a production from S that goes through NT18 NT32, which is t49 t75. But the string is t75 t49, so that's the opposite. So perhaps that first step isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string doesn't start with S, but that can't be. The string represents a series of terminals generated by the grammar, so it must start with S's expansion.\n\nWait, but maybe I should look at the production tree. Let's try to see the possible sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the entire string and see if each consecutive pair of terminals matches any possible production.\n\nBut that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps some parts of the string don't fit the grammar, which would make the answer 'No'.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t75 t49 t74 t77 t69 t74 t26 t15 t1 t1 t1 t49 t69 t74 t77 t63 t69 t53 t78 t78 t52 t69 t34 t69 t74 t69.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check whether the terminals can be produced by the grammar. For example, t75 is produced by NT32. So after t75, the next symbols must come from the expansion of another non-terminal that starts with t49.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 is t49, so perhaps after NS14, which is NT31 NT21, we need one of these to produce t18, but NT31 and NT21 don't directly produce t18. Instead, NT31 and NT21 are non-terminals that expand further.\n\nWait, perhaps the next symbol after t75 is t49, which is from NT18. So maybe the production sequence is:\n\nS -> NS32 NS14\n\nNS"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So some non-terminals now have productions that result in terminals. For example, NT15 can produce 't71' or 't35'. Similarly, NT23 can produce 't34' or 't59'. But in addition, some non-terminals have productions to other non-terminals, which would mean you have to expand them further until you reach terminals.\n\nBut first, the given grammar is in Chomsky normal form. CNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems that each production is either two non-terminals or two symbols, with the second being a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30 (Wait, that's two non-terminals? NT3 and NT30. So that's fine for CNF because it's two symbols on the RHS.)\n\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT6 (Again, two non-terminals.)\n\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT13 (Two non-terminals.)\n\nContinuing down, some non-terminals have productions that result in a terminal and a non-terminal, such as:\n\n- NT15 -> 't71' (a terminal)\n- NT15 -> 't35' (another terminal)\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT23 -> 't59'\n\nSo, the non-terminals which have a -> t production are the ones that can directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-492","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From looking at the grammar, it seems all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t75 t78 t69 t43 t19 t26 t1 t68 t69 t70 t15 t68 t77 t69 t77 t80 t3 t77 t80 t26 t15 t77 t69 t42 t84 t43 t69`.\n\nHmm, I notice all the elements are 't' followed by numbers, which likely correspond to terminals in the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nMy initial thought is to try to parse the string from the start symbol, S, using the grammar. But with the complexity of the grammar and the length of the string, it's going to be a bit tricky. Maybe I'll try to see if there's a pattern or a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait a minute, I notice that 't75' and 't78' appear in the string. Looking back at the grammar, I see that S can produce NT32 NT14, and NT32 can produce T15. Wait, but in the grammar, NT14 can produce NT31 NT21, which in turn might go to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, S can also produce NT18 NT32. Maybe I should consider the possible ways the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with 't75', so I need to find a production that starts with T75. Looking through the productions for NT14, I see that one of them is NT14 -> 't43' (since NT14's productions include a terminal 't43' directly). So, if the first symbol is 't75', perhaps it's produced by some NT.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT32 can produce 't75' because one of the productions for NT32 is 't65', 't68', etc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the non-terminals and terminals. Let me get this straight.\n\nActually, the grammar's rules (like NT32 -> NT14 NT23) seem to be using 't' followed by numbers as terminals. For example, some productions directly have a terminal like 't75' under NT32. Wait, let's confirm that.\n\nLooking at the productions, some NTs have terminal productions with 't75', 't78', etc. For instance:\n\n- NT32 -> 't65' 't68' (This seems like a two-symbol terminal)\nWait, no, the grammar seems to have some cases where an NT directly produces a terminal like NT31 -> 't35', which would mean 't35' is a terminal directly produced by NT31.\n\nSo, 't75' is a terminal produced by one of the NTs. Let me find which NTs have 't75' as a production. From the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT32 -> 't65' 't68' (Wait, is that a two-terminal production? Or is it one NT producing two terminals? No, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So maybe some of these are multi-symbol terminals, but perhaps the parser treats each 't' as a separate terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So each production can only have two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, looking through the grammar, when an NT has a production that includes a 't' followed by numbers, that can only be if that NT directly produces a terminal of multiple symbols, which is not allowed in CNF. So perhaps I misinterpret the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't' followed by numbers are individual terminals, so each 't' is a terminal, and the number is part of the name, but that can't be since in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. So perhaps the grammar is written with 't' followed by numbers as separate terminals, like 't75', 't78', etc., each being a single terminal symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't' and numbers make up the terminal as a single unit, so 't75' is a two-character terminal symbol, but that complicates matters.\n\nWait, but the string given is a sequence of 't's with numbers, like 't75 t78 t69 t43 ...', which suggests that each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal. So each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, given that, I can consider each 't75', 't78', etc., as individual terminals.\n\nGiven that, the top-level approach is to see if the string can be generated by S through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a recursive approach, trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nBut given the length of the string, that's going to take a while. Maybe I can spot some patterns or see if the string can be broken down into parts that are generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I might look for whether the string follows a sequence that can be generated by the given grammar. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't75'. Let's see which NT can produce 't75'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me look for any NT rule with 't75' as a terminal.\n\nHmm, in the production list, I can search for 't75' as a terminal. Let's see:\n\nSearching, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT24 -> 't72'\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider that 't75' is a terminal. Which NT is responsible for producing 't75'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, the production NT32 has 't75' as a terminal. Wait, no, actually, the production for NT32 is something like NT32 -> NT32 NTsomething, but perhaps directly it produces a terminal.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar, I see that some NTs produce terminals, like NT14 -> 't43' (assuming that is a multi-symbol terminal, but given the way the grammar is written, perhaps each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal, meaning a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, for example, NT14 -> 't43' would mean that NT14 can produce the terminal 't43'.\n\nSo, perhaps 't75' is a terminal produced by one of the NTs, like NT32 -> 't75' (but wait, let's check).\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT32: multiple productions, like NT32 -> 't65' 't68', but perhaps that's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps 't75' is a terminal in another NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the NTs that can produce 't75' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this harder than it needs to be. Maybe I'll approach the problem by trying to parse the string backward, starting from the end, using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t75 t78 t69 t43 t19 t26 t1 t68 t69 t70 t15 t68 t77 t69 t77 t80 t3 t77 t80 t26 t15 t77 t69 t42 t84 t43 t69.\n\nI notice it has 27 symbols. Let's start from the end and see if the last symbol can be produced by any NT.\n\nThe last symbol is 't69'. Looking through the grammar, NT21 produces 't69', and also NT31 produces 't69' and other terminals.\n\nSo the last symbol 't69' can be produced by NT21 or NT31.\n\nAssuming that the last symbol comes from S, let's see. S can produce NT32 NT14, or NT18 NT32. So, perhaps the last part is generated by either NT32 or NT18.\n\nBut wait, let's approach step by step.\n\nLet's try to parse the string from the start, seeing which NT can produce the first symbol, which is '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-516","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is quite complex, with many non-terminals and productions. Each production is either of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a terminal. This structure might make parsing a bit intricate, but since it's in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser that handles CNF should work.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t75 t26 t1 t42 t69 t78 t43 t59 t77 t26 t15 t1 t77 t63 t15 t63 t77 t69 t42 t69 t26 t1 t65 t74 t28 t78 t52 t69`.\n\nI notice that each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My goal is to see if there's a derivation path in the grammar that directly produces this string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step either produces a new terminal or combines two symbols. But wait, the given grammar has all productions as two-terminals or a single terminal. Wait, actually, it's more accurate to say that the grammar is in CNF, where each production is a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string only has terminals, so each step must derive those symbols.\n\nTo tackle this, I can consider building a parse tree from the string upwards. However, given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be generated directly or through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt75, t26, t1, t42, t69, t78, t43, t59, t77, t26, t15, t1, t77, t63, t15, t63, t77, t69, t42, t69, t26, t1, t65, t74, t28, t78, t52, t69.\n\nI see that some terminals (like t75, t59, etc.) are directly produced by some non-terminals. For example, NT1 might produce t1 directly.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that NT3 is 't1'. Also, NT1 -> NT23 NT5. Wait, but looking through terms:\n\nLooking for where t1 appears. Let's see: NT3 -> t1. So if a rule includes NT3, it can produce t1.\n\nSimilarly, NT1 is 't6', which is another terminal.\n\nBut I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived step by step.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long. Maybe I should check if each of the terminals in the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find which non-terminals can directly produce those t's.\n\nLooking through the grammar's productions:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side is just a terminal. These are the rules where X -> a.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> t1\nNT7 -> t40\nNT23 -> t34\nNT23 -> t21\nNT29 -> t28\nNT6 -> t53\nNT1 -> t6\nNT0 -> t71\nNT2 -> t28\nNT25 -> t64\nWait, are there any other directly produced terminals? Let's scan through all the productions.\n\nUpon a quick scan, I notice that several NT non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t40\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT23 -> t21\n- NT29 -> t28\n- NT6 -> t53\n- NT1 -> t6\n- NT0 -> t71\n- NT2 -> t28\n- NT25 -> t64\n- NT30 -> t26 (I think there's a production I might have missed. Let me check: NT23 -> t21. Wait, looking again... Yes, there's NT23 -> t34, but I don't see NT23 -> t26? Wait, maybe I missed that. Let me look again.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I don't see NT23 -> t26 in the provided grammar. Similarly, for other terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, it seems that the produced terminals are mostly specific to certain non-terminals, like NT3, NT7, NT23, NT29, etc.\n\nNow, the string contains 27 terminals. Each of these must be produced by some production rule.\n\nI need to check whether all terminals in the string are present in the grammar as direct productions.\n\nLooking through the string: t75, t26, t1, etc.\n\nCheck t75: Looking through the rules, is there any NT-> t75? Let's scan the grammar:\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing t75. The productions are mostly of other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, t26 appears in NT23 -> t21, but I don't see any NT directly producing t26.\n\nWait, so if the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produce t75 or t26, the string would likely not be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let's confirm that. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> t1\n- NT7 -> t40\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT23 -> t21\n- NT29 -> t28\n- NT6 -> t53\n- NT15 -> 't43', 't35', 't33'. Wait, but in the grammar, NT15 could produce 't43', 't42', etc.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar's rules include strings where NT15 produces 't43', 't35', 't33', etc., but from the initial grammar, I think that part might have been edited.\n\nWait, looking back, for NT15, the productions are:\n\nNT15 -> 't43', 't35', 't33'. So NT15 is a non-terminal that can produce some terminal strings. Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the grammar had several entries where NT15 is followed by a single terminal or via other rules. Wait no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided:\n\nHere are the relevant parts:\n\nNT15 -> 't43'\nNT15 -> 't35'\nNT15 -> 't33'\n\nWait, that can't be right because in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So in the provided grammar, each rule must be two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but for NT15, perhaps the original grammar has rules producing combinations of non-terminals and terminals. So perhaps there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe each of those lines represents a production where the non-terminal produces two terminals, but the way the user wrote it, the line is split.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting, but according to the problem statement, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so all RHS should be two non-terminals. Therefore, the last lines where NT15 -> 't43', etc., can't be correct because they only produce a single terminal, which is against CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to have rules like NT15 -> NTsomething NTanother, but it got misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps NT15 is a non-terminal that can't be split into those, but that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last few entries are incorrect. For example:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, perhaps lines like NT15 -> 't43' etc., are actually meant to be multi-symbol productions. But in that case, the right-hand side is just a single terminal, which is against Chomsky normal form.\n\nThis suggests that the problem's grammar might have an error because NT15 as a non-terminal cannot produce a single terminal according to CNF. Because in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the provided grammar, NT15 has productions ending with 't43', etc., which are single terminals. Since that's against CNF, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar as presented.\n\nBut for the sake of proceeding, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that those lines are meant to represent some two-symbol productions, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps those lines are indicating that NT15 can only produce terminals, which is impossible in a correct CNF grammar.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps it's better to assume that perhaps the provided grammar is correct, and the last few productions where NT15 produces a single terminal are actually meant to be two-symbol productions, maybe like NT15 -> NT43, etc. But that would require knowing the structure.\n\nGiven this ambiguity, maybe I should proceed by trying to derive the entire string step by step, but that would take a very long time"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-518","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a specific kind of CFG where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at it, I see that most of the productions are between non-terminals, with the exception of a few that end with terminals like 't' followed by numbers. So the terminals here are all the 't' followed by numbers, and the non-terminals are all the other capital letters and the 't' with digits that aren't followed by another letter. Wait, actually, the non-terminals are all the uppercase letters except those that end with 't' in the productions. Hmm, I might need to parse this correctly.\n\nI also notice that the given string starts with 't75 t69 t1 ...' and ends when I assume the string is finished. The grammar has several productions that terminate with a 't' followed by a number, which I think are the actual terminal symbols. So the string is composed of these terminals, and the non-terminals can expand into these.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of these 't' terms. I need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string should be related to the number of productions needed. Each step in the derivation in CNF can only increase the number of symbols by one, so the number of non-terminals should be one less than the number of symbols. Let me count the number of symbols in the string:\n\nLooking at the string: t75, t69, t1, t46, t71, t53, t52, t69, t69, t34, t78, t22, t69, t21, t69, t74, t17, t78, t46, t71, t43, t34, t3, t69, t69, t34, t15, t69.\n\nThat's 31 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation length should be (n-1) productions, leading to the string. So 30 steps. But I don't need to find the derivation; I just need to check if the string is possible.\n\nThe grammar has several start symbols for S, which is S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. So the initial derivation starts with either of these two.\n\nNow, I think the best approach is to model this as a parsing problem, trying to see if the string can be generated by the grammar, possibly using a recursive descent or similar method. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can use a top-down approach.\n\nGiven the string length is 31, which is quite long, doing this manually would be tedious. I might instead try to see if the string conforms to the productions, checking each step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each adjacent pair in the string can be derived from each other via a production. But since each production requires two non-terminals, I might need to think in terms of splitting the string into groups that can be derived from each production.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to model this as a tree and see if each step can be matched. Alternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from left to right, ensuring that each production is matched as I go.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I can look for patterns in the string that correspond to the non-terminals being replaced. For example, if the string has a 't75', that might be the result of a production like NT32 -> 't75' (but I need to check the grammar for such a production).\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that 't75' is a terminal. Looking at the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces 't75' from a non-terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see a production NT32 -> 't75' as one of the possible productions (since in the grammar, 't75' is written as 't75' but I need to check the exact line). Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, I don't immediately see any production that directly includes 't75'. Hmm, but maybe 't75' is part of a production like NT2 -> ... etc., but I'm not seeing it right now. Wait, maybe 't75' is a result of NT32 expanding directly. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find a production where NT32 appears on the left. Wait, no, in the initial part of the grammar, the first production is S -> NT32 NT14. Then, later, I see other NT productions, like NT30 -> NT3 NT30, etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to look for 't75' as a result of a production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a production NT32 -> ... Wait, in the lines later on, for example, I see:\n\n- NT31 -> NT9 NT11\n- NT15 -> 't71'\n- NT15 -> 't35'\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- etc.\n\nBut I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't75'. So maybe 't75' is a result of a non-terminal that expands into it. Perhaps through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps 't75' comes from a non-terminal that expands to another non-terminal, which in turn expands to 't75'. So maybe I need to find a chain of productions that lead from some NT to 't75'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if 't75' can be derived from one of the non-terminals that can only produce it. For example, some NT might have a production that ends with 't75', but looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see that.\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple lines like:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n- S -> NT18 NT32\n- Then other NT productions.\n\nI also notice that some lines end with 't' followed by a number, like 't71', 't35', etc. So I think these are terminals, not non-terminals. So these are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nSo, for example, 't71' is a terminal. So the NT0 has a production -> 't71'. Similarly, other NTs have productions ending with 't' numbers.\n\nBut the initial NTs like NT32, NT14, etc., may have productions that expand into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production S -> NT32 NT14 is one, and S -> NT18 NT32 is another. So S is the start symbol, and these two are the initial productions.\n\nNow, looking into NT32's productions: I don't see any in the initial section, but perhaps deeper in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me look again. Scanning through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30\n- NT18 -> 't74'\n- NT23 -> 't69'\n- NT31 -> 't69'\n- etc.\n\nBut I don't see NT32 having any immediate productions. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps NT32 is only present in S productions and not on the left side of any other productions. So once S -> NT32 NT14 is used, then NT32 and NT14 must be expanded into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is 't75', which comes after S. Wait, no, the string is `t75 t69 t1 t46 t71 t53 ...` which starts with 't75', which is the first symbol. That seems odd because the start symbol S would produce two non-terminals, so the first symbol should be a non-terminal. But in the string, it's a 't' symbol, a terminal, which can't be derived directly from S.\n\nHmm, that might be a problem. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Actually, in the grammar, the initial productions are S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. So the first step in the derivation would be to expand S into two non-terminals, each of which can produce a sequence of terminals. But the string starts with 't75', which is a terminal, so it must come from one of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the initial step, the S would produce two non-terminals, so the first two symbols in the string would have to come from the expansions of these two non-terminals. So if the string starts with 't75', that suggests that one of the non-terminals (say NT32) directly expands into 't75' as its production.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules provided. CNF means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the provided grammar, I see that the rules all fit this structure\u2014except for the ones ending with terminals like S -> NT75, etc. Wait, no, wait\u2014actually, upon closer inspection, some rules on the right-hand side have multiple non-terminals. For example, S is defined as S -> NT32 NT32, which is fine. Some rules have two non-terminals, others have a single terminal. Wait, no\u2014looking again, some rules like NT4 -> NT25 NT6 would be in CNF because they produce two non-terminals. However, in the given grammar, some rules seem to produce terminals, like NT15 -> 't71' or NT19 -> 't1'. That's a bit odd because in CNF, each production should either have two non-terminals or a single terminal. So in the case of NT15, it's a rule that produces a terminal, which is allowed in CNF as long as all rules are structured correctly. Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So terminals on the RHS would make the rule a single terminal production, which is allowed. So, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal, others produce two non-terminals. That seems acceptable as long as each rule has exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t75 t35 t46 t71 t62 t78 t40 t69 t74 t69 t74 t77 t46 t43 t68 t74 t69 t52 t78 t40 t78 t74 t68 t74 t77 t74 t78 t69 t69`.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse this string using the grammar. Parsing can be complex, but maybe I can find a way to match the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The initial productions for S are S -> NT32 NT32 or S -> NT18 NT32. So the string starts with NT32 and NT32, each leading to 't75' as per the rules.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me check the rules for NT32. From the grammar, I see NT32 has a production: NT32 -> 't75'. So that's how NT32 produces the terminal t75. So S is split into two parts, both NT32, each of which becomes t75. So the start of the string is 't75 t75', but looking at the actual string, it starts with 't75 t35...'. So that doesn't match. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT32 in the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> 't75'. Yes, so NT32 produces 't75'. So if the first production for S is NT32 NT32, then the string should start with t75 t75. But the actual string starts with t75 t35. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the second production for S is used. The other production for S is S -> NT18 NT32. Let's check what NT18 produces.\n\nLooking through the grammar for NT18: I see NT18 -> 't74' as a production. So NT18 produces 't74', and NT32 produces 't75'. Therefore, the first two symbols should be 't74 t75', but the string starts with 't75 t35', so that also doesn't match.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string isn't starting with any of the initial productions of S. But that can't be right because maybe the grammar allows for more complex derivations beyond just two direct productions. Perhaps I need to find a longer path of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the grammar's productions for NT32. Wait, the grammar provided is extensive, so perhaps I should look for all possible ways the string could be formed.\n\nAnother approach: Let's attempt to parse the string step by step, using an algorithm that tries different non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt75 t35 t46 t71 t62 t78 t40 t69 t74 t69 t74 t77 t46 t43 t68 t74 t69 t52 t78 t40 t78 t74 t68 t74 t77 t74 t78 t69 t69\n\nThe initial symbols: t75, t35. Let's think about how these could be derived.\n\nFrom the grammar, t75 appears in the productions of NT32. Specifically, NT32 has a production to 't75'. So that's one possibility.\n\nNow, the second symbol is t35. Looking through the grammar, t35 appears in NT15: NT15 -> 't35'.\n\nSo we might have S -> NT18 NT32, but wait, no\u2014S has S -> NT32 NT32 and S -> NT18 NT32. So starting with NT32 NT32 would give 't75 t75', which doesn't match the string. Starting with S -> NT18 NT32 would give 't74 t75', which also doesn't match. So neither of the initial S productions matches the first two symbols of the string.\n\nHmm, that seems like a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in checking the productions. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT24 has a production NT24 -> 't72', which might not help here. Wait, but I'm looking for t35 and t75 in the string... Alternatively, perhaps the first production isn't direct but comes from a more complex derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a context-free grammar and try to parse it using a recursive descent parser or some other method. Alternatively, since this is a small test case, maybe I can try to find if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can track the possible non-terminals that can produce each part of the string.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't75', which can only be produced by NT32.\n\nThen the next symbol 't35' is produced by NT15.\n\nSo S must produce something that gives 't75' followed by 't35', but according to the initial production rules, S only directly produces sequences like NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32. Neither of which would produce NT32 followed by NT15.\n\nSo perhaps the only way is that one of the non-terminals in the derivation has a production that leads to 't75 t35'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking too linearly. Let me consider if the grammar has any rules that can be applied in a way that produces multiple symbols in a more complex way.\n\nLooking through the rules, perhaps NT32 can be derived through other non-terminals. Wait, do any non-terminals have rules that produce NT32?\n\nFor example, looking at the rules for NT0: It has various productions, including NT0 -> 't40', but that's a terminal. Wait, but I'm interested in where NT32 appears on the RHS.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 can be derived as NT32 via some chain? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe looking at other non-terminals. Let me see NT32: it's on the RHS of NT24: NT24 -> NT4 NT1, and then check if any of those can lead to 't75' and 't35'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the way to approach this is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match each production rule.\n\nThe string starts with t75. So maybe the first part is a derivation of NT32. Then, looking for the next symbols after that.\n\nWait, perhaps the way is that S can produce a more complex structure that eventually leads to t75 t35... But given the limited information, perhaps the approach is to note that t75 is produced by NT32, and then the next symbol t35 is produced by NT15. But how can S produce a NT32 and NT15 in sequence?

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it simplifies parsing, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, let me recall how CNF works. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and each production has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So, looking at the grammar, it seems to follow CNF because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except maybe some have only one? Wait, no, all look like A \u2192 B C, which is fine. \n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t75 t80 t78 t80 t15 t26 t15 t1 t68 t82 t77 t1 t26 t77 t69 t78 t80 t1 t3 t68 t71 t77 t63 t32 t15 t68 t32 t43 t69.\n\nI notice that there are multiple 't' terms, such as t1, t34, etc. From the rules, some non-terminals are set to specific 't' strings when they appear on the right-hand side. For example, looking at the rules, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, meaning S can produce 't32 t14'. So, if the string can be split into parts that match these rules, it's a match.\n\nBreaking down the string into individual tokens: \n\nt75, t80, t78, t80, t15, t26, t15, t1, t68, t82, t77, t1, t26, t77, t69, t78, t80, t1, t3, t68, t71, t77, t63, t32, t15, t68, t32, t43, t69.\n\nThat's 30 tokens. Hmm, the grammar starts with S which in CNF would generate sequences like S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the entire string would have to be split into a sequence of productions where each step combines non-terminals into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, several non-terminals are directly mapped to 't' followed by a number. For example, NT32 \u2192 t75, NT8 \u2192 t46, NT14 \u2192 t43, etc. So, each 'tX' in the string likely corresponds to a specific non-terminal rule.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step:\n\n1. t75: From the rules, looking for NT -> t75. Scanning the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 t75. So 't75' is from NT32.\n\n2. t80: Look for NT -> t80. Checking the rules, NT18 \u2192 t74, which isn't 80. Maybe looking for other rules... Wait, maybe from NT32 \u2192 NT3 NT30, but I don't think that's directly t80. Alternatively, perhaps NT18 \u2192 t80? But in the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 t46, and NT20 \u2192 t26, but nowhere does NT18 directly go to t80. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t82, NT24 \u2192 t12, etc. Perhaps 't80' comes from NT23 \u2192 t70 or another rule. Alternatively, maybe multiple steps are needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent approach. Starting from S, each production should combine two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps building a parse tree would help. Let's try to break down the string.\n\nThe string is: t75 t80 t78 t80 t15 t26 t15 t1 t68 t82 t77 t1 t26 t77 t69 t78 t80 t1 t3 t68 t71 t77 t63 t32 t15 t68 t32 t43 t69.\n\nLet me see if I can group these into possible non-terminals according to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, t75. From the rules, S starts with NT32 NT14, so perhaps the entire string starts with NT32 and NT14.\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75, so that handles the first token. Now, what about the rest? The rest is t80 t78 t80 t15 t26 t15 t1 t68 t82 t77 t1 t26 t77 t69 t78 t80 t1 t3 t68 t71 t77 t63 t32 t15 t68 t32 t43 t69.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would produce t75 followed by whatever NT14 produces. Looking at NT14's production, in the rules, where does NT14 go? From the rules, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, NT14 would need to generate t43 followed by something.\n\nLooking at the string, after t75, the next token is t80. So, the rest after t75 is t80 t78 t80 t15 t26 t15 t1 t68 t82 t77 t1 t26 t77 t69 t78 t80 t1 t3 t68 t71 t77 t63 t32 t15 t68 t32 t43 t69.\n\nBut S's production would split into NT32 (t75) and NT14 (t43...). So, perhaps S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nThen, the string after t75 is t80, which should be part of NT14's production. So, let's look at how NT14 is expanded. NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, the tokens after t75 would be t80, which is the first part of NT31's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT31 has several production rules. For example, NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11, NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6, etc. Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. Alternatively, let me try to see if the entire string can be broken down into the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with NT32 \u2192 t75, followed by NT14 (which is after t75). So, after t75, the first part of NT14 would need to start, which is NT31 \u2192 ... or NT24 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nLooking at the string after t75, the next tokens are t80, t78, t80, t15, t26, t15, t1, etc. Let's see if these can be generated by some combination.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each production in CNF splits into two parts, maybe the string can be recursively split. Let's try to parse it step by step.\n\n1. The entire string must be generated by S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the first part is t75 (NT32) and the rest after t75 should come from NT14.\n\n2. NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So, after t75, the next part is t80... which would be the expansion of NT31 and NT21.\n\nLet's see: After t75, the next token is t80. So, that would be the first part of NT31.\n\nLooking at NT31's rules, NT31 can be NT9 NT11, NT24 NT6, etc. Let's try to break down.\n\nSuppose NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT6. Then the next token after t75 would be NT24 (which would be t24...). Wait, but t75 is the first token, then the second part starts with t80. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for rules where NT31 produces something that starts with t80. Looking through the rules, I see NT24 \u2192 t12, which isn't helpful. Maybe another rule?\n\nWait, maybe NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11. Let me see what NT9 does. NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7, which could generate tokens. But I don't see a 't80' directly from NT9 or NT11.\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-557","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, we've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and a string we need to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of symbols: t75, t78, t6, t82, and so on. \n\nFirst off, I remember that Chomsky normal form means that every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar, it seems all the productions fit that form. That helps because there are some standard methods to check derivations, like using parsers or checking if the string can be broken down step by step using the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t75, which is a terminal. So, I need to find a production in the grammar that starts with the symbol to derive the string. Looking at the grammar, I see some terminals associated with non-terminals. For example, NT32 \u2192 t75, NT2 \u2192 t28, etc.\n\nSo, let's list the productions that produce terminals because we can match them against the string. \n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT32 \u2192 t75\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT8 \u2192 t46\n- NT0 \u2192 t32\n- NT1 \u2192 t6\n- NT4 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t68\n- NT13 \u2192 t43\n- NT7 \u2192 t40\n- NT30 \u2192 t63... wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see that some NT productions go directly to terminals. For example, NT2 is t28, NT6 is t53, NT1 is t6, etc. So the key is that certain non-terminals produce specific terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a series of these terminals. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a way to derive the entire string from the start symbol S, using the productions.\n\nSo, let's start by looking for how the string can be split. The string is:\n\nt75 t78 t6 t82 t78 t40 t15 t26 t1 t42 t84 t77 t69 t74 t35 t49 t1 t74 t65 t80 t3 t69 t74 t1 t68 t84 t32 t80 t69 t69.\n\nHmm, that's quite long. Let's see if we can break it down. Each symbol corresponds to a terminal produced by a non-terminal.\n\nFirst, t75 comes from NT32 \u2192 t75. So S must derive to something that includes NT32.\n\nLooking at the start production, S can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. So the first part would be NT32 and then NT14, or NT18 and then NT32.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t75 (NT32), the next part is t78, which could come from which production?\n\nLooking at the grammar, t78 is produced by NT20 \u2192 t78. So after t75 (NT32), comes t78 (NT20). So the next symbol is t78, which is from NT20.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t75 t78, which corresponds to NT32 \u2192 t75, then NT20 \u2192 t78. So far, the derivation would be S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and we're looking at NT32 producing t75, and then NT14 producing t78? Wait, actually, the production S can be either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Since the first part starts with NT32, the S must be NT32 NT14, and the next production is NT32, which produces t75. But wait, the string starts with t75, so that would imply that S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and then NT32 is further expanded.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how the string is generated step by step. So each step in the derivation generates two symbols, but wait, in CFG, each production can generate multiple symbols. But since the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must ultimately produce this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see each symbol as part of a production chain. Since the string is a concatenation of terminals, each must be the result of a production from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, let's parse the string step by step.\n\n1. t75: comes from NT32.\n2. t78: comes from NT20.\n\nSo after t75 (NT32), we have to produce t78 as the next symbol, which requires NT20 \u2192 t78.\n\nBut how does the parsing proceed? The string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps the grammar can be applied in a leftmost fashion, each time expanding a non-terminal into two symbols or a terminal.\n\nWait, so the grammar's productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So when expanding a non-terminal, it's replaced by two non-terminals, then each of those can be expanded further until all are terminals.\n\nBut since the given string is a sequence of terminals, it must correspond to the leftmost derivation of a sentence that starts with the initial symbol and leads to this terminal sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be split into parts that match the productions. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider that in a leftmost derivation, each step expands the leftmost non-terminal. So starting from S, we choose between S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nThe string starts with t75, which is from NT32, so S must have first expanded to NT32 NT14. Then, NT32 is expanded into t75, and then we have to derive the rest.\n\nBut wait, no, because after S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then we need to consider the expansion of NT32 and NT14 in some order. Since it's leftmost, we'd first expand NT32.\n\nSo first step: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nThen, expand NT32 \u2192 t75. So now, the current string is 't75' followed by the expanded NT14.\n\nSo now, we have to consider NT14 and the subsequent non-terminals generated from it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what produces t78? It's NT20 \u2192 t78.\n\nSo after t75 comes t78, which is from NT20. So perhaps the NT14 is being expanded into something that leads to NT20.\n\nLooking at NT14 in the grammar: the productions are NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21 and NT14 \u2192 NT23 NT5. So NT14 is followed by either NT31 NT21 or NT23 NT5.\n\nSince after NT14 we have NT20 producing t78, perhaps NT14 is expanded into one of these.\n\nWait, let me check. The current string after 't75' is 't78', so after t75 comes the expansion of NT14, which must lead to something that eventually produces t78 as the next symbol.\n\nLooking at the production NT14 \u2192 NT23 NT5. So if we have NT14 \u2192 NT23 NT5, then the next non-terminals are NT23 and NT5.\n\nLooking up NT23's production: NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20. So NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20.\n\nNT5's production: looking at the grammar, NT5 can produce t68 or t35, or via other paths. Wait, in the grammar, NT5 has several productions, but one is NT5 \u2192 t68 (because in the productions list, there's NT5 \u2192 't68').\n\nBut wait, in the initial string, after t75, the next is t78, which would require that NT14 is expanding into something that eventually generates t78.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions:\n\n1. NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21: then NT31 and NT21 would need to produce 't78' as the next symbol. But NT31 could expand into something.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions: NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11 and NT31 \u2192 NT24 NT21 and NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT33, etc. So NT31 might expand into NT9 NT11, which would produce 't6' and something else. But that doesn't immediately get us to 't78'.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider whether NT14 \u2192 NT23 NT5, as that might lead to a path toward t78.\n\nSo NT14 \u2192 NT23 NT5. Then, NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20, so NT23 becomes NT20 NT20.

{"custom_id":"request-551","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Wait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So in this grammar, every rule either has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, it seems that some non-terminals expand into a terminal and another non-terminal, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the start symbol S needs to be replaced by these, which are themselves either terminals or other non-terminals. The string we're evaluating starts with 't75 t80 ...' which are all terminal symbols, so we have to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding S step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string is quite long and contains many 't' followed by numbers, which are probably the terminals. To parse this, I might need to look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals can generate these terminals.\n\nFirst, let me list out the start symbol and see what it can expand to. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the string must begin with either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. Looking at the string, it starts with 't75', so I need to find which non-terminals can produce 't75' when expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals can generate terminals as seen from rules like NT32 \u2192 't75', NT4 \u2192 't56', etc. So for example, if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then NT32 is 't75', and NT14 might expand to something, but in the string, after t75 comes t80. So I need to check if t80 can be generated by expanding NT14.\n\nWait, let's look at the production rules. NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. So NT14 expands to NT31 and NT21. Both of these are non-terminals, so this might not be the right path because the next token after t75 is t80, so if we can't get a terminal in that spot, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see what NT18 can generate. Looking through the rules, I don't see NT18 being defined. Wait, NT18 appears in the string. Let me check the rules. Yes, NT18 \u2192 't43'. So NT18 can produce 't43'.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then NT32 could be 't75', as we saw earlier. So S \u2192 t43 t75. But in the string, the first two tokens are t75 t80, which doesn't match t43 t75. So maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The string starts with t75, so it's possible that S expands to NT32 NT14, where NT32 is 't75'. So S \u2192 't75' NT14. Then NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Both are non-terminals, so that doesn't help because we need t80 after t75. Hmm, but then perhaps NT14 expands further.\n\nLooking at the production for NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Let me check what NT31 and NT21 can produce. NT31 \u2192 't35' and NT6, among others, I think. Wait, looking at the rules: NT31 has multiple expansions, like NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11, and sometimes it produces 't's, like NT31 \u2192 't69' or 't35'.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to parse the string backward. The last token is 't43'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals generate 't43'? Scanning through, I see NT14 \u2192 't43', NT24 \u2192 't56', some others, but let's check if any produce 't43'. Yes, NT14 \u2192 't43'.\n\nSo the last part must be NT14 \u2192 't43'. So the string ends with t43. So the last non-terminal expansion must produce t43, which is only possible if the last non-terminal is NT14.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, which are both non-terminals. So we need to generate 't43' from NT14, which only happens if both NT31 and NT21 expand to something that, when combined, produce t43. But NT31 and NT21 each expand to multiple things, so this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last non-terminal is a two-step expansion. Wait, no, the last token must be a terminal, so the last non-terminal is a production that ends in a terminal. Let's see which non-terminals have a single terminal production. Looking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT32 \u2192 't75' (so S \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 t75 followed by something, which would be NT14. But in the string, after t75 is t80, not the next terminal).\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the string is a concatenation of multiple non-terminal expansions. It's getting a bit tangled, so perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me start building the parse tree from the start symbol S.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' (terminal), so that's the left side done, giving t75.\n- Now, we need to expand NT14 to get the next tokens, which should start with t80.\n\nLooking at NT14's expansions: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Both are non-terminals. So we need to expand NT31 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31, it has multiple productions. Let's see if any can produce 't's. For example, NT31 \u2192 't69', 't35', 't22', etc., but I think the relevant ones for this step would be those leading to t80 and t78.\n\nWait, looking at NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21. Let's see what these can expand to.\n\nNT31:\n- NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n- NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20\n- NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT78 NT27\n- NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT1 OT23\n- etc.\n\nThis is getting too deep, maybe it's better to look at the other option.\n\nOption 2: S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't43' (terminal), so left side is done, giving t43.\n- Now we need to expand NT32 to get 't75' followed by t80, etc.\n\nBut then NT32 is either 't75' or other expansions. So in this case, NT32 \u2192 't75', giving us t43 t75, which doesn't match the string starting with t75 t80. So Option 2 doesn't seem to work because the first part would be t43 t75, which doesn't match the string's t75 t80.\n\nSo Option 1 must be correct, where S \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 t75 (from NT32) followed by NT14's expansion.\n\nSo we have:\n\nt75 [from NT32] followed by [NT14 expansion].\n\nNow, the string's next token is t80. So NT14 must expand to a sequence that starts with t80. Looking at NT14's productions: NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, both of which are non-terminals. So we need to see how these can produce t80.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions: some may lead to t80. Let's see:\n\nNT31's rules:\n- NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n- NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21\n- Maybe others that can produce 't's.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's check the productions of NT14's children, NT31 and NT21.\n\nHow can NT31 and NT21 produce 't's?\n\nLooking at NT31, it has:\n\n- NT31 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-579","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t75 t74 t77 t3 t80 t69 t74 t42 t40 t1 t40 t46 t69 t26 t42 t32 t78 t12 t69 t53 t69 t69 t59 t69 t69 t78 t1 t26 t69 t74 t69`. \n\nFirst, I recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S. The start symbol here is presumably S, but looking at the productions, I see that S can produce NT expressions like NT30 NT32 or NT18 NT32. Then, the non-terminals NT... have their own productions. \n\nThe string starts with t75, and looking at the productions, I see that NT32 can produce 't75'. So, the first part, t75, must come from NT32. So, we can think that the first rule used was S \u2192 NT30 NT32. Then, we have to parse the rest of the string.\n\nAfter t75, the next token is t74. Looking at NT30's productions, I see NT30 -> NT2 NT22. Wait, no, NT30 actually has two productions: NT30 -> NT3 NT30 and NT30 -> NT26 (but looking back, I might have misread). Wait, the grammar provided is quite extensive. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT30, the productions are: NT30 -> NT3 NT30 and NT30 -> NT2 NT22. So, when we see t74, that comes from NT30, which is part of NT30's first production (but wait, NT30 can also produce NT2 NT22, which I might need to check if that leads to t74).\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, NT30 has two productions: \n1. NT30 -> NT3 NT30\n2. NT30 -> NT2 NT22\n\nSo, when we derive, the first step is S \u2192 NT30 NT32, which gives us t75 (from NT32) and then NT30 and NT32. So, the second token is t74, which comes from NT30. So, looking at NT30's productions, which of them can produce t74.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions for NT30 are:\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT30 -> NT2 NT22\n\nWait, so these are both non-terminals. So, how do we get 't74'? Let me check the terminal symbols in the grammar to see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some of the terminal symbols are 't' followed by a number, like t75, t74, etc. For example, NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', and 't34'. NT23 can produce 't34'. NT0 can produce 't40', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, NT5 has two rules: NT5 -> 't68', so when NT5 is derived, it produces 't68'. Similarly, looking for 't74', perhaps it comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the productions again, I see NT18 -> 't74', so 't74' is produced by NT18. So, in our string, the second token is t74, which would have to come from NT18.\n\nSo, going back, after t75 (from NT32), the next is t74 (from NT18). So, perhaps the derivation is S \u2192 NT30 NT32, producing t75 and then NT30 and NT32. But after that, how does NT30 produce t74? Wait, since NT30's productions are non-terminals, t74 must come from NT30's derivation through more steps. But wait, that doesn't make sense because NT30 can only produce other non-terminals, not terminals. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is built.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of t's, so maybe each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the non-terminals are expanded into sequences of t's. So, in that case, each non-terminal in the derivation tree must expand into a string of terminals. So, let's think step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT30 NT32. So, the string starts as [NS NT30] [t75] [NS NT32]. Wait, no, let's think that S \u2192 NT30 NT32, so the first step is to produce NT30 and NT32. Then, NT30 is expanded into a sequence of terminals, and NT32 into another sequence. So, the first token is from NT32.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT32 has two productions: NT32 -> 't75' (from earlier) or, wait, looking back: under NT32 I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT32, it has NT32 -> 't75', because looking at the production NT32 -> 't75' is present. So, the first token is t75, so that comes from NT32.\n\nSo, now we have NT30 and NT32. So, the string starts as [NS NT30] t75 [NS NT32]. So, then, after t75, we have the expansion of NT30 and then NT32.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. When you derive the string, each non-terminal is replaced by its right-hand side (RHS). Since S \u2192 NT30 NT32, the first step is to write NT30 followed by NT32. Then, each of these non-terminals is expanded recursively.\n\nWait, so the initial step is to replace S with NT30 NT32, resulting in [NT30] [t75] [NT32]. Then, each of these non-terminals is expanded into their respective RHS. So, the parsing process would involve expanding NT30 and NT32 into their RHS until only terminals remain.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think in terms of the parse tree. Starting from S, it branches into NT30 and NT32. So, S: NT30 NT32.\n\nNow, the string starts with t75, which must come from NT32. Looking at NT32's productions, the first is 't75', so yes. So, NT32 is 't75'. That would mean the first token is 't75'.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is: t74 t77 t3 t80 t69 t74 t74 t69 t42 t40 t1 t40 t46 t69 t26 t42 t32 t78 t12 t69 t53 t69 t69 t59 t69 t69 t78 t1 t26 t69 t74 t69.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me clarify. When you expand NT30, it produces NT3 and NT30. So, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. So, the first expansion is NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30.\n\nThen, the string starts as t75 (from NT32), followed by NT3 and NT30.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the string is a flat list of terms, and the non-terminals are being expanded into sequences of t's.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's try to parse the string step by step, trying to match the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is: t75 t74 t77 t3 t80 t69 t74 t42 t40 t1 t40 t46 t69 t26 t42 t32 t78 t12 t69 t53 t69 t69 t59 t69 t69 t78 t1 t26 t69 t74 t69.\n\nFirst token is t75. Looking at the grammar, t75 is produced by NT32. So, in the derivation, the NT32 must expand into t75. So, the first part is handled.\n\nNow, after t75, the next tokens are t74, t77, etc. This suggests that after NT32 (which is t75), the NT30 (from S \u2192 NT30 NT32) is expanded next.\n\nSo, now we look at NT30's expansion.

{"custom_id":"request-571","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite complex with a bunch of non-terminals, including NT1 to NT35 and some terminals like 't1', 't75', etc. The string I'm given to evaluate is a series of these terminal symbols: `t75 t40 t69 t74 t69 t80 t26 t1 t1 t77 t69 t15 t46 t43 t42 t77 t69 t82 t77 t69 t77 t69 t77 t1 t63 t68 t69 t74 t77 t69 t69`.\n\nUnderstanding the task, I need to parse this string using the provided grammar and check if it can be derived through the production rules of the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The input string's production will be a series of these steps.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the string step by step. Let's break the string into tokens for clarity:\n\nt75, t40, t69, t74, t69, t80, t26, t1, t1, t77, t69, t15, t46, t43, t42, t77, t69, t82, t77, t69, t77, t69, t77, t1, t63, t68, t69, t74, t77, t69, t69.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the starting symbol is S, and S has two production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nI need to see if the string can be generated by starting from S and applying these rules and others step by step.\n\nLet's see. The first step might involve choosing one of the two productions for S. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: S becomes NT32 NT14.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I need to find what the rules for NT32 and NT14 are. Hmm, looking back, I see NT32 -> NT2 NT22. So NT32 expands into NT2 and NT22. Similarly, NT14's rule is NT31 NT21. \n\nSo NT32 NT14 becomes (NT2 NT22)(NT31 NT21). So the string starts with t75. Let's see where t75 comes from. Looking through the grammar, I notice NT25 -> t64. But wait, looking for more, I see NT33 -> t52. However, t75 is a terminal. Checking the rules, the only place I see t75 is in NT34 -> t12, but not t75. Wait, actually, in the grammar, there's a rule NT34 -> t75. Yes, that's the rule NT34 -> 't75'. So t75 comes from NT34.\n\nBut the first step is S -> NT32 NT14. So I'm trying to figure out how t75 is generated. Let me see the dependencies.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps the string starts with t75, which comes from NT34. So, let's see if t75 can be a terminal in the expansion.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the production for NT34 is NT34 -> t75. So that's straightforward. Now, to get t75, the NT34 must be part of the derivation.\n\nBut in our first step, S expands into NT32 and NT14. So, perhaps the string starts with NT32. Let's see the structure. It's possible that NT32 itself expands into t75 through a chain of productions.\n\nLet me try to break down NT32:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nNow, looking at NT2, its production rules are:\n\nNT2 -> NT22 NT15\nNT22 -> NT8 NT0\nNT15 -> NT28 NT17\nNT28 -> NT21 NT25\nNT17 -> NT22 NT10\nNT21 -> NT69 t46  (Wait, no, looking back: NT21-> t69, because the rule is NT21-> t69. So NT21 is a terminal when expanded.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's look again:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT21 is defined with a production that ends in 't69'?\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see NT15 -> t46, NT21-> t69, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, for NT21: Do I see a rule where NT21 is a terminal?\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT15 -> t46\nWait, no, the actual rules:\n\nLooking again, for example, NT23 -> t99, but more importantly, some non-terminals expand into terminals. For example:\n\nNT7 -> t1\nNT24 -> t12\nNT9 -> t49\nNT17 -> t68\nNT13 -> t28\nNT28 -> t82\nNT2 -> t28\nNT0 -> t71\nNT24 -> t12\nNT5 -> t68\nND19 -> t1\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, for example, NT7 is expanded into 't1', NT24 into 't12', etc.\n\nSo, the terminal symbols in the string are the t's, and others are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model the string as a series of terminal and non-terminal symbols, trying to apply the grammar rules step by step.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the given string can be broken down into the sequences provided by the grammar.\n\nLet's consider the first token: t75. We need to find a non-terminal that expands into t75. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT34 -> t75. So, to get t75, we need NT34. So, somewhere in the derivation, we need to have a NT34 that expands into t75.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the production for NT34 is NT34 -> t75. So NT34 must be in the right place.\n\nBut where is NT34 appearing in the string? Hmm, perhaps it's derived from NT32 or something else.\n\nWait, NT32's production is NT2 and NT22. So, to get t75, maybe NT32 should eventually lead to NT34 which leads to t75.\n\nLooking at NT32's rules, NT32-> NT2 NT22, and NT2 has rules NT22 NT15.\n\nSo, NT32 becomes NT2 NT22, which leads to (NT22 NT15) (NT22 NT15?) Wait, no, each NT is expanded separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion would go like this:\n\nNT32 : NT2 NT22\nNT2 : NT22 NT15\nNT22 : NT8 NT0\nNT22 : NT8 NT0 (another rule)\nNT15: NT28 NT17\nNT28: NT21 NT25\nNT21: t69\nNT25: NT27 NT10. But NT10 has its own rules.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the breakdown step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string starts with 't75 t40 t69...' and see if the grammar can produce such a sequence.\n\nStarting with t75:\n\nt75 comes from NT34 -> t75. So the first part is NT34.\n\nBut in the S productions, S can lead to NT32 and NT14. Not directly to NT34. So, unless the derivation reaches NT34, it can't produce 't75' as the first symbol.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t75, so the derivation must start with S, leading to some process that eventually produces NT34.\n\nAlternatively, if the first part is S -> NT18 NT32, then let's see what that leads to.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbols are t75, which suggest that perhaps the initial non-terminal must derive t75.\n\nBut looking at S, it's possible that S can lead to NT34 at some point, but how?\n\nLooking at S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nThen NT32 -> NT2 NT22, as per the rule. Then NT22 -> NT8 NT0. NT0 can be 't71' or other terminals.\n\nWait, in the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-592","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complicated with a lot of production rules. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at this grammar, I see some rules that might not fit that exactly. Wait, no, actually, it's still in CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or terminals. So that's acceptable.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t75 t52 t26 t69 t72 t78 t3 t43 t59 t78 t1 t1 t68 t3 t68 t71 t77 t42 t53 t19 t77 t69 t78 t78 t78 t46 t40 t26 t15 t77 t69 t69`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens. I suppose each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal. Let's see which ones look like terminals. It seems like most of them start with 't', which might be terminals, or maybe some are non-terminals if they have non-terminal symbols.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, some of the right-hand sides have non-terminals that end with uppercase letters, like S, NT30, NT4, etc. So the terminals are those that don't appear as non-terminals. Looking at the string, I see 't75', 't52', etc. Are these terminals or other structures?\n\nWait, I should check the grammar. Let me scan through some production rules. I see, for example, NT30 -> NT3 NT30. Oh, so NT30 is a non-terminal that expands into itself. Similarly, NT3 is a non-terminal with its own production. But in the string, the first token is 't75'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see 't75' as a right-hand side of any production. Therefore, 't75' must be a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, 't52' isn't on the right-hand side of any production, so it's a terminal. So the entire string seems to be a sequence of terminals. I need to check if there's a derivation that produces this sequence.\n\nBut with a grammar that has a lot of non-terminals, maybe there's a systematic way to approach this. Perhaps I can try to parse the string from the end, using a method like the CYK algorithm, but that might be too time-consuming for such a long string.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I can look for the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be built step by step. But given how many non-terminals there are, that's going to be tricky.\n\nAnother approach: since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parser to see if the string can be fully parsed. However, writing a parser for this would be quite involved, especially with all these non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can identify patterns or the structure of the grammar. For example, looking at some of the production rules:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32 | NT18 NT32\nWait, looking more carefully, S seems to be split into two parts. Hmm, perhaps the string starts with 't75', which might come from NT32. Or not? Wait, in the grammar, NT32 has a production rule NT32 -> NT2 NT22. But I don't see 't75' in any NT rule, so maybe 't75' is a terminal from NT32.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reconsider. The string is a list of terminals, each of which must be the result of a production. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should have a binary structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map the string's tokens to the grammar. But without knowing which tokens correspond to which non-terminals, it's challenging. But perhaps each non-terminal's production can generate a sequence of terminals.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the grammar rules, the most straightforward production is S -> NT32 NT32 or S -> NT18 NT32. So each S starts with either NT32 or NT18. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT32's production: NT32 -> NT2 NT22. But wait, in the string, the first token is 't75', which isn't a production from NT32. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how to map the string tokens to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a terminal in some rule. For example, 't75' is a terminal, so it must be generated by a production where the right-hand side is just 't75'. But looking through the grammar, none of the right-hand sides are single terminals except for the 't's listed at the end. Wait, at the end of the grammar, I see some 't' sequences:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT23 -> 't34'\n...\nNT31 -> 't69'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals directly produce a single 't' token. For example, S seems to produce other non-terminals, but perhaps some non-terminals produce 't's at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for the string tokens in the grammar's right-hand sides. If a token is a production in the grammar, then I can trace back.\n\nWait, the grammar has several rules that directly produce a single 't':\n- NT23 -> 't34' (But in the given grammar, I see NT23 has multiple productions. Wait, looking more carefully, I see that some non-terminals have productions that output terminals. For example, looking through the grammar:\n\nI see that some non-terminals directly produce 't's:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34' (Wait, actually, in the given grammar lines, there's a rule like NT23 -> 't34'? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> 't34'\n\nYes, this means NT23 can produce 't34'. Similarly:\n\n- NT23 -> 't21' (In the later lines)\n- NT29 -> 't71' etc.\n- So each of these is a production of a non-terminal into a terminal 't' with a specific index, like 't34', 't21', 't71', etc.\n\nSo every 't' in the string must be generated by such a production. Let's now see if every token in the given string appears in any (non-terminal) rule as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t75, t52, t26, t69, t72, t78, t3, t43, t59, t78, t1, t1, t68, t3, t68, t71, t77, t42, t53, t19, t77, t69, t78, t78, t78, t46, t40, t26, t15, t77, t69, t69.\n\nEach token is a 't' followed by numbers. Now, I'll check if each of these corresponds to a terminal in any production.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't75' is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, in the production rules, I don't see any rule where the right-hand side is just 't75'. So unless 't75' is a production of some non-terminal, it can't be part of the string.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that some non-terminals produce 't's, like NT23->t34. So each 't' must be a result of a specific non-terminal's rule.\n\nBut the string has 't75' which might not correspond to any non-terminal's rule. Similarly, 't52' also might not be present.\n\nWait, let me look through the grammar for each 't' token. For instance:\n\nLooking for 't75': I see in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule that ends with 't75'. Similarly, 't52' isn't present. 't26' might be from NT7 or other non-terminals, but I don't see a production that gives 't26'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each 't' is a terminal, meaning that for it to appear in the string, it must be directly produced by some rule. So if the grammar doesn't have any rule that generates 't75', then 't75' can't appear in any string derived from this grammar.\n\nBut let me look through the grammar's right-hand sides.

{"custom_id":"request-599","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite large, with over 100 production rules, and the string provided is a sequence of symbols ending with 't69 t69 t69'. \n\nFirst, I should recap what the grammar looks like. It's in CNF, which means each production is either a terminal symbol or two non-terminal symbols. The starting symbol is 'S', and from there, all the productions build up the string. The given string starts with 't75 t49' and ends with several 't69's. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, every non-terminal in the productions directly expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT32 NT32. So, to generate the string, each symbol must come from expanding each non-terminal step by step until we hit terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it starts with 't75'. From the grammar, I remember that S is defined as NT32 to NT32. Checking the production rules, NT32 can expand to either NT3 and NT30, or NT2 and NT1. Each of those NTs would then further expand according to their own rules.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by working backwards from the string. Let me see which non-terminals lead to terminals like 't75'. Looking at the grammar, I see that 't75' is a terminal and it's derived from NT2. Checking the productions, NT2 can expand into NT22 and NT15. Let me check where 't75' comes from.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT32 -> T72 is generated via NT4. Wait, maybe I should list all the production rules that generate 't75'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT2 NT17, and that NT2 could later produce terminal 't75'? Or wait, is there a rule that directly leads to 't75'? \n\nWait, looking again: The rule NT32 -> NT2 NT17, and then what's NT2? NT2 can be NT22 NT15. But according to the grammar, 't75' is under NT24 ->NT12 NT1, but not sure. Alternatively, 't75' is in the production of NT2 via NT24: NT24 -> NT24 NT20, etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't75' is the result of a specific NT. Looking through the rules, for example, NT32 can produce 't75', but looking back, I don't see that. Let me check the given rules again. Oh, in the rules, for example, NT24 can expand to t75? Or maybe looking at the production rules where 't75' is present. \n\nWait, in the provided grammar, there's a rule NT24 -> NT24 NT18 or something, but 't75' appears in the production NT32 -> NT32, but more importantly, I see NT32's production includes 't75' in the rules under NT32's expansion.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the rules, I see that the last line in the grammar is NT34 -> NT12 NT1, but I need to check each NT rule to see if any production leads to 't75'. \n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT24 -> NT23 NT30 or something. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the direct rule where 't75' is produced. Alternatively, perhaps 't75' is a terminal derived from NT32. Let me look for when NT32 directly produces 't75'. \n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see an explicit production rule where NT32 goes directly to 't75'. So maybe my initial thought was incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps 't75' is produced by a different NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at each production and backtrack. Starting from the end, since the string is a sequence of terminals, we can try to see if each terminal can be derived from the grammar step by step.\n\nSo, the last part of the string is ... t69 t69 t69. Let me check where 't69' is derived from. 't69' is a terminal; looking at the grammar, where is it produced? Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see \"NT23 -> 't34'\" but that's not helpful. Wait, perhaps looking for a production that yields 't69'. Alternatively, 't69' might be in the rules of some NT.\n\nWait, looking through the rules more carefully: I see \"NT17 -> 't68'\", \"NT14 -> 't43'\", etc. Alternatively, 't69' might be from NT21's production: NT21 -> 't69'. So, NT21 can produce t69. So, in the string, the last three symbols are t69 t69 t69, which would imply that somewhere we have NT21 expanding into t69, and perhaps that non-terminal further breaks down into more t69's.\n\nWait, let me think about that.\n\nLet me take the entire string and try to parse it. The string is:\n\nt75 t49 t1 t69 t74 t69 t19 t46 t69 t26 t26 t15 t49 t1 t78 t43 t78 t22 t69 t26 t26 t78 t1 t15 t69 t74 t77 t69 t32 t69 t69 t69\n\nSo, the last three are t69 t69 t69. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nAssuming each symbol is a terminal, in a leftmost derivation. So, for the last t69, it must come from NT21, as per the grammar. Let me check: NT21 is produced in several rules, such as:\n\nNT21 -> 't34' (Wait, did I see that earlier? No, looking through the rules, somewhere like NT21 is used.)\n\nWait, no. Looking again, for instance, \"NT30 -> NT2 NT22\" but 't34' is another terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break down each part of the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t75.\n\nLooking that up, how do we get t75?\n\nIn the grammar, 't75' is the terminal for which production rules define NT32 -> ... ?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT32's production as follows:\n\nLooking at the rules, it's possible that 't75' is directly from NT2, but no. Alternatively, maybe NT32 doesn't directly produce 't75'. Wait, perhaps it's better to check each rule that leads to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n- NT19 -> 't1' or 't15' or 't33'\n- NT23 -> 't34' or 't21' or 't70' or 't59'\n- NT0 -> 't32', etc.\n\nHmm, maybe 't75' is in the NT24's production? Wait, 't75' appears in the rule for NT34: NT34 -> 't12' NT1. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe 't75' is from NT24 via some path. Alternatively, perhaps 't75' is the result of NT2->... leading to NT22 and NT15. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at each NT rule and see where 't75' comes from.\n\nLooking for a rule where NT... becomes 't75'. For instance:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT24 -> NT27 NT10\n- NT27 -> NT24 NT1\n- NT25 -> NT31 NT18\n- NT15 -> NT27 NT21 or NT19 NT17, etc.\n- Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nMaybe I should list all the possible NTs that can produce 't75'. Alternatively, perhaps focusing on the fact that the string starts with t75, and the grammar's rules for the start symbol might include t75's productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which branches into NT32 twice. So S -> NT32 NT32.\n\nSo each NT32 would expand into two NTs, which would then each expand further, until they all resolve into terminals.\n\nIf the first symbol is t75, perhaps one of the paths in NT32 expansion starts with that.\n\nLooking through NT32's productions:\n\n- NT32 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-614","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has a specific structure where each production rule has two non-terminals or terminals on the right side. CNF is useful for parsing, but my task here isn't about parsing; it's about generating.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The problem is to check if the string can be derived using these production rules.\n\nThe provided string is: t75 t49 t78 t53 t26 t1 t35 t69 t21 t78 t40 t15 t42 t69 t78 t80 t42 t71 t77 t46 t43 t69 t17 t74 t3 t43 t78 t40 t1 t69 t21 t15 t69.\n\nHmm, that's a lot of terminals. I need to see if this string can be generated by starting from the start symbol S and applying the production rules until I get the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first thing is to see the production rules for S. Scanning through the grammar, I see:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S can produce a sequence of two non-terminals, either NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32. Therefore, the string starts with either NT32 or NT18 followed by NT14 or NT32 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t75 and t49. I need to see if any of these production rules for S can lead to these tokens.\n\nWait a minute. The output of the S rule is non-terminals, which eventually produce terminals. Each non-terminal must be expanded into terminals via the productions.\n\nI need to trace the string back to the grammar. Maybe it's a good idea to build the parse tree in reverse, checking if each terminal can be generated by a non-terminal as per the rules.\n\nLet's start with the entire string. It's a sequence of 31 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the length by 1. Starting from one non-terminal (S), applying each production two at a time (as in CNF), the number of symbols should double each time. Wait, no, in CNF, each production expands one non-terminal into two, which could mean the length increases by one each time. So, for example, a string of length n can be generated by a grammar where the start symbol is expanded to two symbols, each of those can be expanded, etc., ultimately leading to all terminals.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that the number of steps required to derive the string is equal to (length of string - 1). But given the string's length is 31, that would require 30 steps. That's complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into the two parts produced by S. But looking at the string, it starts with t75, which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So maybe the string is built from the two non-terminals in S's first production.\n\nWait, S produces two non-terminals, so the entire string must be a concatenation of the expansions of those two non-terminals.\n\nBut how do I represent this? Let's consider that each production step leads to non-terminals that eventually expand into sequences of terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with t75, which must come from the expansion of the first non-terminal in the S's production.\n\nBut t75 is a terminal. So let's check which non-terminal can produce t75. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT30 -> NT3 NT30; that seems recursive. Other rules: NT0 is a non-terminal leading to t40. Wait, looking through the list, I notice some rules like NT0 -> 't40', NT23 -> 't34', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo let's look for which non-terminals produce t75. Let me scan through the rules:\n\n- Looking through NT0, NT1, NT2, etc., I see that NT7 -> 't1' is a production. But that's not t75.\n\nWait, further down, I see NT31->... and NT33->... NT35->... Let me check:\n\nLooking for 't75'. Checking rules:\n\nLooking through the provided rules:\n\nI notice NT32 has a rule NT23 -> 't34', but 't75' isn't present there. Wait, perhaps I need to check the full list:\n\nLooking for 't75' in the production rules. Scanning through the rules, I find:\n\nNT33 -> 't22' NT22 -> 't3' NT14 -> 't43', but not t75.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each rule to see if any non-terminals produce t75.\n\nLooking through, I see NT18 -> 't74', NT14->'t43', NT23->'t34', NT27->'t77', NT30->'t63', etc. I don't see t75 being a direct production. Wait, but NT31 is set to 't69', 't33', etc. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the t75 comes from the NT32 production.\n\nWait, in the S grammar, the first production is NT32 NT14. So if NT32 expands to something that includes t75.\n\nLooking at NT32's rules: Do any of its productions directly or indirectly lead to t75? Wait, the provided rules for NT32 are: Looking through the provided rules, I don't see a direct production for NT32 except as a target in some productions. Maybe I need to check if NT32 can produce t75.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT32: I don't see a direct production like NT32->t75. Instead, the rules seem to involve recursive expansions. For example, NT30 -> NT3 NT30. So NT32 might expand into a chain that eventually includes NT0 or another terminal production.\n\nWait, let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nLet me try to find which non-terminal can generate t75.\n\nLooking through the terminals in the string: first is t75.\n\nLooking for which non-terminal (let's say X) eventually produces t75. So X would be a non-terminal that expands into a sequence of terminals, ending with t75.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1', which is a terminal, but t75 is different.\n\n- NT0 -> 't40', but that's not helpful.\n\n- NT23 -> 't34', again not t75.\n\n- Let me check NT26: NT26->... Looking through, I don't see it unless it's a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any non-terminal directly produces t75. From the rules provided, I don't see any production rule that directly produces t75. So t75 must come from a longer expansion via non-terminals.\n\nSo, t75 must come from a non-terminal, say X, which is part of a production chain that eventually produces t75.\n\nLooking for X such that X can generate t75.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 -> NT23 NT5. Neither of these directly produce t75.\n\nNT5 -> NT27 NT21. Neither produce t75.\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27-> 't77' and NT5-> 't68'. Not helpful.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for any non-terminal that can produce t75 by expanding. Alternatively, perhaps t75 is from a production of NT31 or another.\n\nWait, in the string, after t75, the next token is t49. So the first token is t75, the next is t49. So perhaps the expansion starts with the first production of S, which is NT32 NT14, and the first part (NT32) produces t75, and the second part (NT14) produces something else.\n\nWait, looking at the start production S -> NT32 NT14. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT32 and the expansion of NT14.\n\nSo, the string is t75 t49 ... and so on. So the first part is t75, which comes from NT32, and the second part is t49, which comes from NT14.\n\nWait, no. Because NT14 is a non-terminal, so it would expand into a string as well.

{"custom_id":"request-616","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a series of tokens, some of which look like numbers and others like 't' followed by letters or numbers, e.g., 't75', 't69', etc.\n\nFirst, I recall that a Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammar has all production rules in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, all the rules do seem to fit this pattern, so I can proceed.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these tokens. My goal is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. It might be tricky because the number of possible derivations could be huge, so a direct approach might not be feasible.\n\nI think about how the parsing process works. In a CNF grammar, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the string derived from S using these productions should generate the target string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't75'. I need to see which part of the grammar produces 't75'. Looking at the rules, under NT34, there's a production: NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1, and another: NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1, etc. Wait, I see a rule NT34\u2192NT12 NT1? Or maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, under NT34:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT24 NT18\n\nBut also, I see a production for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nSo the start symbol S can produce sequences of non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can further produce other symbols, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nThe string begins with 't75', which is a terminal. So there must be a production that directly produces 't75'. Looking through the rules, under NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32, and another rule NT34 \u2192 NT12 NT1. Hmm, not directly seeing 't75' yet.\n\nWait, let me look again. There's a rule NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21, NT5 \u2192 NT19 NT17, and also under NT0: NT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18, etc. But I see a specific production for NT6 under NT24: NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1. Hmm, no, NT24 has multiple rules like NT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2, but also NT24 is involved in many productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for direct terminals. Let me scan the rules for any terminal on the right-hand side. Looking through the grammar, I see that there are several places where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal. For example:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\nNT24 \u2192 't72'\nNT5 \u2192 't68'\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\nNT28 \u2192 't82'\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nand a few others.\n\nWait, 't34', 't72', etc. So the terminal symbols are these t followed by certain numbers. The string has 't75', 't64', 't53', etc.\n\nNow, is there a rule that directly produces 't75'? Let me go through the rules. Wait, I see 't75' appearing in the production for S? Or perhaps through a non-terminal.\n\nLooking back, under S: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. But those non-terminals (NT32 and NT14) probably produce more non-terminals which can then lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if each token in the string can be derived. Starting from S, the string should be a sequence of terminals, so S must derive the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree step by step would help, but the string is quite long, so that might not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help syntax analysis, but setting up CYK manually for 20 symbols seems tedious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string corresponds to a leftmost derivation. So starting from S, I can see what the leftmost symbols could be.\n\nLet me try to see the structure of the string. The string is 28 tokens long. Each token is either a 't' followed by numbers or just those numbers. So each is a terminal symbol.\n\nI can note that the string starts with 't75', which I'm not sure how to derive yet. Maybe it's generated by some NT.\n\nLooking again, under S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So S starts with NT32 followed by NT14. So the leftmost symbol is NT32.\n\nNow, NT32 is a non-terminal that can be expanded. Let me check the production rules for NT32. Looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT4 NT25\n\nWait, so under NT32, the production is NT32 \u2192 NT4 NT25. Each of those can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThen NT4 can produce, for example, under NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't56' Oh wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT20\n\nNT4 \u2192 't68'\n\nWait, no, actually, under NT4: The rules are\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1? Or maybe I need to check again. Wait, actually, under NT4:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't56' nowhere. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing. Let me find all NT4 rules.\n\nLooking through, under NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't56'? Wait, I don't see that. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan all the NT4 rules:\n\nLooking for NT4 \u2192 something:\n\nHmm, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT20\n\nNT4 \u2192 't56'? Or is that another rule? Wait, perhaps I see:\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. Looking at the rules, yes, under NT4, there's a production: NT4 \u2192 NT24 NT1.\n\nWait, but in that case, each step could lead further. Alternatively, perhaps I need to see which non-terminal expands to a terminal 't75'.\n\nWait, maybe 't75' is in fact a non-terminal because I don't see a rule that directly produces '75'. Because in the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't75'.\n\nWait, the only terminals are those with 't' prefixes, like 't75', 't64', etc. So each terminal in the string starts with 't' followed by some number. So the string includes 't75', 't64', etc.\n\nSo, to generate the string, each of these terminals must come from some production rule where a non-terminal expands directly into that terminal.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the direct productions for terminals are things like NT23 \u2192 't34', NT24 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't68', NT19 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nSo, for the string to be generated, each 't' sequence in the string must be a terminal symbol generated by a non-terminal that has a production rule directly to it.\n\nNow, let's check if each 't' in the string is covered by such a production.\n\nFor example, the first token is 't75'. Is there a production that directly produces 't75' from some non-terminal? Looking through the rules, in the production for NT24, there are several options. Wait, NT24 \u2192 't72' is one option, but 't75' is given as a terminal token in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check where 't75' appears as a production. Looking through the given rules, does any production directly yield 't75'? Looking through the list:\n\nLooking for any production right-hand side that is 't75' or starts with 't75'.\n\nWait, looking at where 't75' appears in the rules:\n\nUnder NT24: NT24 \u2192 't72', which is different.\n\nUnder NT25: NT25 \u2192 't64'. So 't64' is derived from NT25. That's probably okay, as one of the tokens in the string is 't64'.\n\nSimilarly, under NT24 again: Look up all NT24 rules. Looking through, under NT24:\n\nWait, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT24 NT24\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT2 NT22\n\nWait, none of these seem to generate a terminal like 't75' directly"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-640","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to evaluate. I need to determine if the string is generated by this grammar. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, a quick recap on CNF. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing easier, but for this task, it's about deriving the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions look a bit complex, but I can see some patterns. Each non-terminal on the left is producing two non-terminals on the right, except for the few that produce terminals directly. So, for example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which are both non-terminals. Similarly, NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30, which seems to be a recursive production. \n\nNow, the given string is: t75 t1 t40 t69 t74 t69 t74 t68 t71 t69 t1 t26 t15 t77 t46 t40 t77 t46 t69 t78 t80 t68 t74 t40 t3 t69 t74 t77 t1 t63 t32 t68 t69 t69.\n\nI notice that the string consists of a series of tokens, each seems to correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will be a binary tree, and each step the non-terminals expand into two non-terminals until terminals are reached. The string must match exactly the leftmost derivation path, I think.\n\nBut parsing such a long string might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or the presence of certain sequences that might indicate whether it's possible or not.\n\nWait, looking more closely at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce a terminal and a non-terminal, like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but are those terminals? Let me check the production rules:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, all the rules are left-hand sides with non-terminals, and each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. For instance, NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT32, where NT32 \u2192 't75'. Wait, actually, in the list, some non-terminals have rules that include a terminal like 't75', which suggests that NT32 \u2192 't75' as a terminal. Similarly, NT28 can expand into 't82', etc.\n\nSo, some non-terminals produce terminals, making them terminal symbols. So the grammar seems to mix non-terminals and terminals. That complicates things because a string with only terminals is a derivation of the grammar.\n\nBut how can I approach this? Maybe I can construct a bottom-up parser or use the fact that all productions are in CNF to simulate the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if all the given tokens can be derived by looking for a possible derivation path.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, 36 tokens, I need to think if there's a systematic way.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in CNF, each production on the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and each expansion of that non-terminal leads to two tokens. So the entire string must consist of the leftmost derivation starting from S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I'd have to see if it can be split step by step by matching the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals, and see if each terminal in the string is allowed by the grammar.\n\nBut that might not be straightforward, as non-terminals can expand into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can build the parse tree from the string upwards, trying to find if it's possible to reach the start symbol S.\n\nBut that's going to be time-consuming. Maybe I can try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar by breaking it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the number of tokens in the string must correspond to the number of productions that are expanded. Let me see: For a derivation starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the number of symbols in the string must be a power of 2 minus 1? Wait, no. More precisely, the length of the string after n steps would be 2^n.\n\nWait, the initial S is one symbol, then each production replaces one symbol with two, so the number of symbols doubles each time. So the total number of symbols in the string must be 2^k for some k.\n\nLooking at the given string, the length is 36. Let's see: 36 is 2^5 + 4, but that's not a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 36 is not a power of two, which suggests an error, because in a derivation using CNF, each step doubles the number of symbols. So after k steps, you have 2^k symbols. Thus, the total number of symbols should be a power of two. Since 36 isn't, this suggests that the string cannot be derived from the given grammar, which is in CNF.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm that. Let me think again. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a.\n\nSo starting with S, first step: S is replaced by two non-terminals, say X and Y. So now two symbols. Each subsequent step replaces each non-terminal with two symbols, but in parallel for each unit. So, for each application, the number of symbols doubles. So if you start with one, after 1 step you have 2, after 2 steps 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.\n\nSo 36 symbols would require 2^(k) = 36, but 36 isn't a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 36 isn't possible. Therefore, any string that isn't a power of two in length can't be derived from a CNF grammar. This suggests that the given string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, does this apply even when some non-terminals produce terminals? For example, some non-terminals might produce a terminal, so when they expand, you get one terminal and one non-terminal, or two terminals. So perhaps in that case, the number of symbols doesn't have to be a power of two.\n\nWait, yes, that's correct. Because in the example, a non-terminal might produce a terminal and a non-terminal. So if you have a production like A \u2192 a B, then expanding A gives a and B. Then when you expand B, if it's non-terminal, you can get more symbols.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning all productions are either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So each non-terminal can be expanded into two symbols, either both non-terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the productions are:\n\n1. A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal symbol.\n\n2. A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nSo in this case, when you expand a non-terminal, you can get either a single terminal (if it's a single terminal production) or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, no: no, a production like A \u2192 a is allowed, but if a is a single terminal. If a is a string of terminals, that would make it not CNF.\n\nSo in this grammar, each production on the left is a single non-terminal; on the right, if terminal, it's a single terminal, but if it's two non-terminals or a combination?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right if it's not a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-638","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by this context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string is a sequence of tokens that might correspond to the left-derivations of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal as the right-hand side (RHS). Looking at the given grammar, I don't see any production with three non-terminals or a mix of terminals and non-terminals. All seem to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So that checks out.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t75 t69 t40 t1 t26 t15 t68 t68 t1 t22 t69 t78 t43 t19 t26 t69 t74 t69 t74 t77 t80 t40 t46 t19 t42 t59 t74 t71 t42 t32 t77 t26 t43 t69`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will have a tree structure where each step splits a non-terminal into two others until all are terminals. The length of the string can give me some information. In CNF, the maximum number of symbols in a derived string from a non-terminal S is 2^n, where n is the number of productions. But here, the string's length is 35 symbols. I need to see if it's possible.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the initial step from S would involve splitting into two non-terminals. Then each of those can potentially split again, leading to more non-terminals until they're replaced by terminals.\n\nI should try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar's productions, to see if it can be derived.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers. It might be helpful to think of each 't' as a terminal, and the numbers as non-terminals. So the string can be thought of as a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, all RHS of productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, meaning S can be replaced by NT32 and NT14. Each of these can then be replaced further.\n\nLet me try to break down the string. Each token in the string is either a 't' followed by a number, like 't75', which I'll consider as a terminal symbol T with the name 't75'. The goal is to see if there's a series of productions in the CFG that can derive this sequence.\n\nI notice that the first part of the string is `t75 t69 t40 t1 t26 t15 t68 t68 t1...`. So perhaps we should see if 't75' can come from a non-terminal that can be replaced by 't75'. Looking at the grammar, I see a production where NT32 \u2192 't75', which is directly a terminal. So maybe NT32 is the starting non-terminal for that part.\n\nWait, S can derive into NT32 and NT14. NT32 can produce 't75' directly. So if the first part of the string is t75, that would require that the NT32 is expanded into 't75', and then maybe other parts are derived from NT14.\n\nBut looking at the string, after t75, we have t69, t40, t1, etc. So perhaps the next non-terminal after NT32 is NT14, which then needs to derive the rest of the string.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So after expanding S, we have NT32 and NT14. Each of these can be expanded into other symbols.\n\nSo, NT32 is replaced by 't75', and NT14 is replaced by something else. But the next token after t75 is t69. So maybe NT14 is replaced by something that can derive t69 after t75.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built from a longer chain. Wait, perhaps I should model this as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check for each 't' in the string if it's possible given the grammar. For example, is there a production that directly gives a 't'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT32 \u2192 't75', NT2 \u2192 't28', NT0 \u2192 't40', etc. So any 't' in the string must come from one of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see:\n\nt75 \u2192 possible from NT32.\n\nt69: Looking through the productions, do any non-terminals produce t69? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT6 NT18\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28 \u2192 t28 is a production.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find if there's a production that directly produces 't69'. Looking at the given grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is replaced directly by 't69'. Hmm, that's a problem. Because every production either produces another non-terminal or a terminal, but if a terminal is part of the RHS, it must be a single terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar more carefully, for example, NT28 can produce t82. Similarly, NT14 can produce t43. But NT28 itself has a production NT28 \u2192 t28, but that's under another transformation.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for NT28, the productions are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28, which produces two non-terminals, or a terminal in another branch. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this case, I'm looking for any production that directly replaces a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the productions, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t1\n\nNT23 \u2192 t34\n\nNT24 \u2192 t72\n\nNT5 \u2192 t68\n\nNT19 \u2192 t1\n\nWait, so some non-terminals can directly produce single terminals like t1, t34, etc. So t69 would need to come from a production where a certain non-terminal is replaced by 't69'.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't69' directly. So if there's a 't69' in the string, it must come from a derivation where a non-terminal expands into a terminal as part of a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find a path where from some non-terminal, after several expansions, a terminal 't69' is produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't69' is a result of merging non-terminals that eventually result in that terminal.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's list out all the terminals in the string:\n\nt75, t69, t40, t1, t26, t15, t68, t68, t1, t22, t69, t78, t43, t19, t26, t69, t74, t69, t74, t77, t80, t40, t46, t19, t42, t59, t74, t71, t42, t32, t77, t26, t43, t69.\n\nSo each of these is a terminal. To generate this string, the grammar must have a way for each of these terminals to appear in order through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces exactly one non-terminal with two symbols (which could be terminals or non-terminals). The process continues until all symbols are terminals.\n\nGiven that, let's try to model the derivation. The initial symbol is S, which can expand into NT32 and NT14.\n\nOption 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nThen, NT32 \u2192 t75. So the string starts with t75. Next, NT14 can expand. Looking at NT14's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t75 NT14 \u2192 t75 NT31 NT21.\n\nThen, we need to expand NT31 and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions, I see NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT33, and also NT31 \u2192 NT9 NT17, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to answer 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. But in the given grammar, I see some productions like S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which are two non-terminals, which is fine. Other productions have two non-terminals as well, like NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30. Wait, that's two non-terminals, so that's still CNF.\n\nNow, looking at the string to evaluate: `t75 t69 t1 t40 t78 t80 t69 t74 t49 t40 t69 t74 t69 t69 t21 t15 t1 t1 t69 t74 t69 t74 t15 t1 t65 t68 t82 t65 t1 t65 t3 t77 t69 t40 t69`.\n\nEach token in the string seems to be a terminal symbol, presumably representing a terminal in the grammar. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string using the grammar, starting with the start symbol S and attempting to derive the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production will generate two symbols at each step. So, the string should have a length that's a power of two, or something that can be broken down recursively.\n\nBut before diving into parsing, maybe I can look for patterns in the grammar. The start symbol S has two productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the string must start with either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Checking the string, the first token is 't75'. Now, I need to see which non-terminals correspond to 't75'.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I notice that several are mapped to 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT32 \u2192 't75', NT30 \u2192 't63', and so on. So, each non-terminal corresponds to a specific 't' string.\n\nWait, let me make a list of which non-terminals produce which 't's. From the grammar:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56'\n- NT3 \u2192 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT24 \u2192 't12', 't17', 't24', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't40', 't71', 't80', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals have multiple productions that produce the same 't's. For example, NT15 has three productions that all result in 't15' being mapped to specific strings. Similarly, NT31 has multiple 't's.\n\nGiven this, maybe it's easier to map each non-terminal to a specific 't' token. Let me try to see which NT corresponds to each 't' sequence in the string.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\n1. t75\n2. t69\n3. t1\n4. t40\n5. t78\n6. t80\n7. t69\n8. t74\n9. t49\n10. t40\n11. t69\n12. t74\n13. t69\n14. t69\n15. t21\n16. t15\n17. t1\n18. t1\n19. t69\n20. t74\n21. t69\n22. t74\n23. t15\n24. t1\n25. t65\n26. t68\n27. t82\n28. t65\n29. t1\n30. t65\n31. t3\n32. t77\n33. t69\n34. t40\n35. t69\n\nWait, some tokens are longer than others. Some are single 't' letters, while others are multiple. For example, 't75', 't69', etc., are single tokens, but 't78', 't80' are also single tokens, but others like 't69' are single. Now, looking at the grammar productions, some non-terminals correspond to specific strings:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' (one token)\n- NT4 \u2192 't56' (one token)\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' (one token)\n- NT7 \u2192 't40' (one token)\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' (one token)\n- NT27 \u2192 't77' (one token)\n- NT5 \u2192 't68' (one token)\n- NT8 \u2192 't46' (one token)\n- NT17 \u2192 't68' (but earlier I saw NT24 \u2192 't56' as well, maybe conflicting)\n  \nWait, maybe I should make a mapping of each NT to its corresponding 't' string.\n\nLet me try to do that step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' \u2192 token 't75'\n- NT4 \u2192 't56' \u2192 token 't56'\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' \u2192 token 't1'\n- NT7 \u2192 't40' \u2192 token 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34' \u2192 token 't34'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77' \u2192 token 't77'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68' \u2192 token 't68'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46' \u2192 token 't46'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68' \u2192 token 't68'\n  \nWait, so both NT5 and NT17 produce 't68', but different NTs. Similarly, NT4 and NT24 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, so when a non-terminal can produce the same 't' string as another, that might complicate things.\n\nLooking back, I think perhaps I should try to map each 't' token in the string to a possible NT. If each token corresponds to exactly one NT, then the parsing would be straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me look at the string tokens again. The string is: t75, t69, t1, t40, t78, t80, t69, t74, t49, t40, t69, t74, t69, t69, t21, t15, t1, t1, t69, t74, t69, t74, t15, t1, t65, t68, t82, t65, t1, t65, t3, t77, t69, t40, t69.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar again, let me see for each non-terminal, what is the corresponding string:\n\n- NT32: 't75'\n- NT4: 't56', 't74', 't56' (for example), but in the string, 't74' comes up multiple times. Wait, no, some non-terminals produce 't74' as well. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT27: 't77' (no)\n- NT24 has multiple productions:\n  - NT24 \u2192 NT27 NT10 \u2192 't77' 't40' \u2192 't77t40'\n  - NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 \u2192 't56' 't1' \u2192 't56t1'\n  - NT24 \u2192 NT20 NT20 \u2192 't53' 't53' \u2192 't53t53'\n  - NT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6 \u2192 't22' 't18' \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-660","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is \"t75 t78 t43 t34 t15 t77 t80 t3 t15 t68 t65 t78 t59 t77 t1 t63 t25 t69 t43 t21 t1 t78 t46 t69 t78 t80 t43 t34 t3 t69 t59 t3 t43 t69 t69\", which seems pretty long. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, all in the form of A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I should recall the basics of Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars such that each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. This makes parsing easier, especially with algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But for this problem, I might not need to use an algorithm because the string is already provided, and I need to check if it's in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT32 \u2192 t75, NT7 \u2192 t1, etc. So the strategy here is probably to see if the given string can be derived by following the production rules step by step.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into tokens: [\"t75\", \"t78\", \"t43\", \"t34\", \"t15\", \"t77\", \"t80\", \"t3\", \"t15\", \"t68\", \"t65\", \"t78\", \"t59\", \"t77\", \"t1\", \"t63\", \"t25\", \"t69\", \"t43\", \"t21\", \"t1\", \"t78\", \"t46\", \"t69\", \"t78\", \"t80\", \"t43\", \"t34\", \"t3\", \"t69\", \"t59\", \"t3\", \"t43\", \"t69\", \"t69\"]. That's 40 tokens. \n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step in the derivation will replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. The leftmost derivation corresponds to the parse tree.\n\nTo see if the string can be generated, I can try to parse it from left to right, ensuring that at each step, a non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut parsing manually for a string of 40 tokens without knowing the starting symbol might be tedious. Wait, the starting symbol in the grammar is S. So the entire string must eventually be derived from S.\n\nBut looking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Hmm, so S can produce two non-terminals in each case. I'll need to see how the string can fit either of these.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first token, which is \"t75\". According to the grammar, NT32 \u2192 t75. So to produce \"t75\", S must first produce NT32 and NT14, or NT18 and NT32.\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the first non-terminal is NT32. The first token is t75, which is NT32's production. So we can proceed.\n\nCase 2: S \u2192 NT18 NT32. The first non-terminal is NT18, but t75 is NT32. So Case 2 doesn't apply here; it would require the first token to come from NT18, which doesn't produce t75.\n\nTherefore, we can discard Case 2 and go with Case 1: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. The first token is t75 (NT32 \u2192 t75). Now the next step is to expand NT14 and the rest.\n\nBut I think I might be getting ahead of myself. Since the string is long, perhaps there's a pattern or recurring non-terminals that are used in the productions. Let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT32 \u2192 t75\nNT7 \u2192 t1\nNT3 \u2192 t1\nNT17 \u2192 t68\nNT13 \u2192 t43\nNT31 \u2192 various terminals\nNT24 appears in several productions, some of which produce terminals like t42, t53, t79, etc.\nNT5 \u2192 t68, t59\nNT19 \u2192 t1\nNT23 \u2192 various terminals like t34, t40, t70, etc.\n\nSo many of the non-terminals directly produce terminals. The recursive productions are mostly between non-terminals.\n\nLet me note that each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Therefore, each step in the derivation either combines two non-terminals into another or replaces a non-terminal with two others.\n\nGiven that, to parse the string, each terminal must correspond to a production from a non-terminal, and the structure must follow the grammar.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to try to see if the string adheres to the grammar's structure, maybe by grouping the tokens into pairs, since each non-terminal production (except for those that produce a terminal) introduces two non-terminals. But wait, in this case, we have both types of productions: some non-terminals produce a single terminal, and others produce two non-terminals. So the derivation tree can have both leaves (terminals) and internal nodes (non-terminals).\n\nThis makes the string a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but since the entire string must be a terminal string, the root S must expand into a string of terminals.\n\nLet me try to see the possible expansion. Starting with S, which can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nGiven the first token is t75, which is NT32 \u2192 t75. So in this scenario, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the expansion starts with NT32 and NT14.\n\nSo the string must start with t75 (from NT32), followed by whatever comes from NT14 and the rest.\n\nLooking at NT14's productions:\nLooking through the grammar, NT14 \u2192 t43, which is one of the productions. So NT14 can be replaced by t43.\n\nSo the first part would be t75 followed by t43.\n\nNow, let's look at the string again: the second token is t78. But in this case, the second token should come from NT14, which produces t43. However, the given string's second token is t78, not t43. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption about the first expansion (S \u2192 NT32 NT14) might not be correct, or perhaps the parsing requires multiple steps of expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT14 is part of a longer chain of productions that leads to more non-terminals. Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that NT14's productions are:\n\nNT14 -> NT5 NT32\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\n\nLooking at these, NT14 can expand into two non-terminals. So in the string, after t75 (from NT32), the next tokens could be from NT5 and NT32, or NT31 and NT21.\n\nSo perhaps the second token t78 is from NT5 or NT31.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT5's productions are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t68\nNT5 \u2192 t59\nNT5 \u2192 t69\nWait, I see a mistake here. In the grammar provided, for NT5, let's recheck:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t68\nNT5 \u2192 t59\nAnd more:\nLooking further:\n\nLooking again, the rules for NT5:\n\nIn the original grammar, for NT5: NT5->t68, NT5->t59, and other rules like NT5\u2192t69, etc. Wait no, actually:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, actually, no, let me check line by line:\n\nThe grammar list includes:\n\n...\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT28 -> 't82'\n...\nSo, NT5 can produce t68, t59, t69, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule either produces two terminal symbols or a non-terminal symbol, which makes parsing easier.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t75 t35 t1 t69 t74 t3 t77 t3 t71 t3 t40 t69 t3 t78 t40 t1 t1 t82 t77 t63 t78 t69 t69 t21 t74 t3 t69 t74 t68 t33 t26 t49 t1 t78 t69 t69`.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. Since it's in CNF, every non-terminal eventually expands into a sequence of terminals, and each production is a binary tree structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals lead directly to terminals:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT14\n- nt32: production seems to lead to t75 or NT24\n- NT24 can produce NT4 (NT5) or NT2\n- NT17 can produce t82 or NT13, which can lead to t40 or NT13 again\n- And so on.\n\nWait, but some of these terminals are repeated. The string has a lot of 't's, so I need to track how each 't' is derived.\n\nLet me see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions.\n\nThe first token is t75. Looking at the grammar, t75 is produced by NT2. Since S is the starting symbol, perhaps the first step is to have S -> NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, S expands into NT32 and NT14. Let's check NT32: according to the grammar, NT32 could produce NT24 NT18 or be a different option? Looking back, the grammar has S -> NT32 NT14, and NT32 -> NT24 NT18. So, yes, NT32 can produce NT24 and NT18, and NT18 can produce t74 or NT6.\n\nWait, t74 is a terminal in the string, so let's see:\n\nt74 is from NT18 -> t74. So in the string, after 't75', we have 't35', which is NT31 producing t35. Wait, but we have S expanding into NT32 and NT14. So, the first two tokens should be from NT32 and NT14. Let me see:\n\nt75 is from NT2, but in the grammar, S -> NT32 NT14 starts the expansion. So the initial production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would mean the first tokens should come from NT32 and NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t75 t35. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT32 options: NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT18 or is there another production? From the given grammar, looking through, I only see S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and that's it. Wait, the initial S has two rules, but within the NT rules, is there a production for NT32?\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT32: I see that NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20 is one production, etc., but does any NT32 have a production? Wait, in the provided grammar, after NT32, I don't see any direct production except possibly in the later rules, but looking for NT32... Hmm, I don't see any NT32 \u2192 ... statement. So perhaps NT32 is a terminal. But that can't be, because the S production uses NT32, so it needs to expand.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nThe grammar has S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nOther non-terminals have their productions. So, for NT32, perhaps it's a terminal? But the string has 't75 t35...', meaning that after S, which is the start symbol, it expands into NT32 and NT14.\n\nSo, NT32 must generate a 't' or a non-terminal. But if NT32 is a non-terminal, then according to the grammar rules, how does it expand? Because in the provided grammar, there's no production for NT32 except as part of the S's production.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through all the NT definitions. I don't see any production for NT32 beyond the initial S's. Maybe NT32 is a terminal. But if that's the case, then the expansion would produce 't75 t35' as per the first two symbols, but perhaps I should check.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT0 -> 't40' or similar, but for NT32, perhaps it's a terminal. Let's see: in the list, I see NT2 -> 't28', NT3 -> 't1', etc., but I don't see NT32 being a terminal. So it must be a non-terminal that has to expand.\n\nBut in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT32 except perhaps in the initial S rule. So maybe NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT18, as per another rule.\n\nYes, looking at the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 NT6 NT27 or NT18 \u2192 NT18 NT18? Wait, no, wait: Wait, the grammar has several entries. Let me list all the productions again to clarify.\n\nWait, I think I might have copied some incorrectly earlier. Let me go through the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the first lines are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, S can produce NT32 followed by NT14, or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nEach non-terminal can also produce various combinations of other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, but none of the non-terminals have a production where NT32 is on the left, except as part of S.\n\nSo, looking deeper, do any non-terminals have NT32 as their left?\n\nLooking for NT32: do I see any rule where NT32 produces something?\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT30 -> NT3 NT30\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT6\n- NT24 -> NT2 NT13\n- NT2 -> NT22 NT15\n- NT13 -> NT19 NT17\n- NT24 -> NT30 NT2 (if any)\nWait, maybe I missed. Let me look thorough.\n\nWait, no, I don't recall any production for NT32 except in S's rule. So perhaps NT32 is a terminal.\n\nBut that's not indicated in the grammar. So that's a problem. Because if NT32 is a terminal, then S \u2192 t32 t14, but in the string, the first tokens are t75 and t35. So that can't match.

So NT15 can produce these terminals.\n\nBut NT15 can also generate other non-terminals, perhaps leading to more productions.\n\nBut how does that help with t75?\n\nWait, perhaps the first t75 is from NT32. But I don't see a production for NT32 beyond being part of S.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I need to clarify what NT32 produces.

{"custom_id":"request-680","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string in question is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar has a lot of production rules. My task is to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF has two main requirements: every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing algorithms because it simplifies the grammar structure, making it easier to apply certain parsing techniques like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to use a specific algorithm here since the problem is more about manually checking the derivation.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice that every production is indeed in CNF, as each rule has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, or a single terminal. This confirms it's a CNF grammar, so that's good.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the provided string: \"t75 t79 t78 t40 t3 t46 t26 t78 t40 t74 t77 t79 t69 t53 t74 t1 t63 t69 t80 t1 t69 t74 t74 t77 t78 t74 t74 t1 t63 t69 t74 t40 t26 t1 t68 t69\".\n\nI should note that the grammar includes a lot of non-terminals and terminals, some of which are mapped to specific tokens in the string. For example, I see that NT15 can produce 't35' and 't40', as well as other terminals. Similarly, NT5 can produce 't68' or other tokens. There are a lot of non-terminals that correspond to specific strings of terminals, which will be useful in mapping parts of the string back to the grammar.\n\nMy approach will be to try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into parts that match the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation can only produce a sequence of two non-terminals or a single terminal. This suggests that the string should be decomposable into a series of non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals as per the rules.\n\nHowever, manually parsing this string is quite tedious and error-prone, so I might look for patterns or possible expansions in the string. I can start by identifying the tokens in the string and see if they can be traced back to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first token: 't75'. I check the grammar rules and find that NT2's production includes 't75' (NT2 \u2192 t75), so that could be where 't75' comes from. So, 't75' corresponds to NT2.\n\nNext, the string is 't75 t79...'. Since NT2 is a non-terminal, the next token should be derived from the productions of NT2. Looking at NT2's productions:\n\nNT2 -> NT1 \u2192 t6, NT22 \u2192 t1, NT22 \u2192 t40, etc.\n\nWait, I think I need to see the actual production rules for NT2. From the given grammar, I see that NT2 has several rules, including NT2 \u2192 NT24 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 NT23 \u2192 etc., but let me check if I have accurate memory of the rules.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's grammar has a lot of rules. Let me list some that involve NT2.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n- NT1 \u2192 NT23 NT5\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT20\n- NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT27 NT21\n- NT27 \u2192 NT24 NT10\n- NT21 \u2192 NT8 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT23 NT18\n- NT8 \u2192 NT11 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 NT22 NT5\n- NT22 \u2192 NT8 NT0\n- NT13 \u2192 NT10 NT28\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n- NT7 \u2192 NT40\n- NT23 \u2192 NT20 NT18\n- NT20 \u2192 NT12 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT24 NT17\n- NT17 \u2192 NT22 NT10\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT32\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. The string starts with 't75 t79...'.\n\nThe first token is 't75', which comes from NT2. So, S initially must expand to NT32 NT32 (from the first production: S \u2192 NT32 NT32 NT32? Wait no, the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT32, and the second is S \u2192 NT14 NT32. Wait, actually, I think I misread the initial grammar. Let me check.\n\nThe first line says S -> NT32 NT32, so that's one production, then S-> NT14 NT32. So, there are two possible starting points for S. So the string must start with one of the two possible options.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are 't75 t79'. So 't75' is from NT2, and the next is 't79', which is from NT79. But looking at the grammar, where does 't79' come from? From the given rules, I don't see NT79 producing anything. Wait, that's a problem. Let me check all the rules to see if any non-terminals result in 't79'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only token that directly is 't79' is in NT24 \u2192 t79, but I don't see any NT rule that expands to 't79' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see:\n\n- NT79 is present in the grammar on line NT24: NT24 \u2192 t79...? Wait, no, line 121 (if counting carefully):\n\nLine 120: NT24 \u2192 t79 t79\n\nWait, no. Wait, the user provided all the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT24 has a rule producing 't79 t79', but that's for NT28. Let me check each line carefully.\n\nWait, the user provided the following rules (truncated for brevity):\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT17\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n\n...\n\nFurther down, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t79 t79 (line 71)\n\nWait, here's the relevant part:\n\nLooking at the given rules, I can see several NT24 rules:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 (line 116)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT17 (line 116; perhaps a typo)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT28 NT2 (line 117)\nWait, but in the more detailed rules:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 NT32 (line 42)\nNo, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, to clarify, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, each line being a production. So let's go through the lines:\n\n1. S->NT32 NT32\n2. S->NT4 NT32\n   So S can expand to either NT32 NT32 or NT4 NT32.\n\nNow, the first token is 't75', which comes from NT2 \u2192 t75 (I think). So in the string, the first symbol is 't75', which must have come from NT2 expanding to t75.\n\nBut since S can expand into NT32 or NT4, perhaps the string starts with 't75 t79...' which may not fit if S \u2192 NT32 NT32 or S \u2192 NT4 NT32.\n\nLet me see: S expands to either NT32 NT32 or NT4 NT32. So the structure is S \u2192 NT32 NT32 or S\u2192 NT4 NT32.\n\nSo the first two symbols in the string are 't75 t79'. So the first non-terminal must expand to 't75', which requires that the first NT32 or NT4 is NT2, but wait: the first production of S is NT32 NT32, so S \u2192 NT32 NT32. So the first expansion is NT32 leading to 't75', then the second NT32 expanding to something, which must be 't79'.\n\nBut looking more carefully, perhaps I should try to break it down.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t75 t79, which would imply that the first NT32 expands to 't75"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-698","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar does seem to follow CNF because all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t75 t28 t26 t1 t68 t1 t1 t80 t69 t74 t80 t33 t74 t82 t69 t69 t21 t26 t1 t15 t77 t69 t82 t42 t69 t26 t42 t19 t77 t1 t26 t19 t3 t35 t69 t69`.\n\nWow, that's a long string with 38 symbols. My goal is to see if this string can be derived by the given grammar. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I know that parsing can be done using a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, manually checking each step might not be feasible. Instead, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar and see if the string can logically follow from it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the start symbol S always expands into either NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Each of these are non-terminals, meaning they themselves can produce other strings until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t75 t28 t26 t1 t68...` I notice that `t75` is a terminal symbol, so I need to see where `t75` appears in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see that NT32 has a production to `t75`. Specifically, in the rules earlier: \n\nNT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22\n...\nNT32 \u2192 t75 (I think, let me check) Wait, in the given productions, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT32 -> t75. So, `t75` is the terminal symbol resulting from NT32. So the first part of the string starts with NT32 \u2192 t75.\n\nNext, after t75, the string is t28. Let's see where t28 comes from. In the productions, I see:\n\nLooking through, I find NT28 \u2192 t28 (from NT17, NT28, etc., but the key is that there's a rule NT28 \u2192 t28 as a terminal. Wait, looking back:\n\nLet me scan the rules for NT28 \u2192 t28. Oh, I see:\n\nNT28 -> t82 (multiple times), but also NT28 -> t28 is not explicitly present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, I don't see an explicit rule where NT28 \u2192 t28. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing it. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT28 \u2192 t28. So perhaps the string is wrong? Or maybe I missed it. Wait, perhaps it's generated via a longer production. Alternatively, perhaps the string isn't valid because of this.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The given string is:\n\nt75 t28 t26 t1 t68 t1 t1 t1 t80 t69 t74 t80 t33 t74 t82 t69 t69 t21 t26 t1 t15 t77 t69 t82 t42 t69 t26 t42 t19 t77 t1 t26 t19 t3 t35 t69 t69.\n\nWait, let's check if t28 is a terminal. From the productions, I see that several NTs produce t28 as a terminal. For example, NT17 \u2192 t28 is present in the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t68, but also NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28, but no, wait: Wait the rules say:\n\nLooking back: Oh, no, looking through the rules:\n\nI see NT28 -> NT28 NT28 (as a production rule). But that's a way to expand, not a terminal. Then, do any rule for NT28 directly produce t28?\n\nWait, yes, I think I found it:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t82 (multiple times), but I don't see a production where NT28 \u2192 t28. Hmm. So maybe the string can't be derived because t28 isn't a terminal that any NT directly produces. Or perhaps it is produced through another route.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a production where NT28 can produce t28. Wait, let me scan the rules again more carefully.\n\nI see this line: NT28 -> t28, but no, looking through, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, here's the list of rules for NT28:\n\nNT28 -> NT28 NT28 (producing another NT28)\nNT28 -> NT28 NT25 (another production)\nNT28 -> NT28 NT15\nNT28 -> NT25 NT15\nWait, that doesn't include a terminal. So, perhaps t28 is not a terminal at all. Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I saw something else. Maybe I'm looking at the rules and not paying attention. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t82 is present multiple times, but no rule for NT28 \u2192 t28. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the string, after t75 comes t28, so if NT32 \u2192 t75, then NT32 would need to produce t75, but the next symbol is t28, which would have to be produced by something else downstream.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the start symbol S branches into NT32 and NT14. Let's explore that.\n\nThe string starts with NT32 \u2192 t75, which matches the first token. Then, after t75, comes t28. So, perhaps the next step is that the NTS downstream from NT32 split into something that leads to t28.\n\nBut without a direct production for NT28 \u2192 t28, it's unclear how t28 can come from NT28. Maybe it's an internal node that leads to a terminal through expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed in such a way that t28 comes from a deeper expansion. For example, if NT28 can expand into other non-terminals that eventually produce t28.\n\nBut without an explicit production for NT28 \u2192 t28, I'm unsure. Let me search for any production where NT28 \u2192 t28. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nLooking through the rules again, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each rule one by one.\n\nNT28's rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT28\n- NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT25\n- NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT15\n- NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT15\n- NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT15\n- NT24 NT25 (No, that's NT28 \u2192 NT24 NT25)\n- Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the rules. Let me make a list.\n\nWait, perhaps I see this:\n\nNT28: \n- NT28 -> NT28 NT28\n- NT28 -> NT28 NT25\n- NT28 -> NT28 NT15\n- NT28 -> NT25 NT15\n\nNo, there's also:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT24 NT1 (among others), but NT28's rules don't include any terminals.\n\nSo, if the grammar doesn't have a rule where NT28 directly produces t28, then the symbol t28 in the string can't be generated unless it's produced through some other path.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t75 (from NT32), then t28. So, there must be a way for the first NT32 to eventually produce t75 and the next part to produce t28. But since NT32's productions are to other NTs, not terminals, perhaps the next symbol after NT32 is part of the expansion.\n\nWait, no, the NT32 would produce t75 directly if there's a rule, but I don't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-692","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of symbols ending with 't' followed by numbers and sometimes 't'. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has a non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The grammar provided uses non-terminals like S, NT1, NT2, etc., and terminals marked with 't' like t75, t49, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice most of the elements are of the form t followed by a number, except for some entries like 't32' and others. The grammar's structure suggests that non-terminals can be expanded into other symbols, which can eventually lead to terminals. \n\nI start analyzing the grammar's structure. The starting symbol is S, which can split into S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Each of these NT symbols can have their own productions, sometimes leading to more NT symbols or terminals. My task is to see if, through a series of these productions, the given string can be derived.\n\nThe string starts with t75, t49, t78, etc. I need to determine if each of these can be connected through the grammar's productions. For example, t75 is produced by NT32, which has a production like NT32 \u2192 NT7 NT32. NT7 can be 't1', so t75 would be 't1t75' if it's derived from NT7 directly.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should approach this by seeing how the grammar can derive strings starting with these t symbols. Since the grammar has a lot of non-terminals that eventually produce terminals, I think the string is a concatenation of such productions.\n\nI also notice some non-terminals that directly produce 't', like 't49', 't75', 't26', etc. So each t in the string could be the result of a production where the non-terminal is expanded into a 't' followed by a number.\n\nAnother important point is that the grammar contains several non-terminals that generate other non-terminals, like S\u2192NT32 NT14, which could themselves lead to more non-terminals until they terminate with a 't', potentially forming the string elements.\n\nHowever, the presence of certain non-terminals that have cycles, like NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1 and NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT20, could lead to infinite loops if not careful. But since each production eventually can reach a terminal or a non-terminal that doesn't cycle again, it's manageable.\n\nLooking at the string, it has a long sequence. Maybe I can find if this string is formed by breaking down the grammar's rules step by step. Each 't' seems to come from a terminal production, so each 't' must be the result of a non-terminal that directly matches the corresponding 't' in the string.\n\nI think I should check each part of the string to see if it can be matched through the grammar. For example, the first element t75 is produced by NT32. From the grammar, NT32 can split into NT7 and NT32, and NT7 is 't1', so t75 would be 't1t75', which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe another production for NT32. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production for NT32 beyond the initial ones. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the first rule is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and another is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Then, NT32 can split into NT7 and NT32. But looking further, there's another production for NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22, so perhaps NT32 could go elsewhere, but I might be missing some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t in the string is produced by a separate non-terminal chain. For example, t75 could be produced by NT32, which further splits into NT7 and NT32. NT7 is 't1', so t75 would end up as t1t75. But the string starts with t75, so that might not match. Alternatively, maybe the grammar can produce 't75' directly if there's a production for NT75, but I don't see any such rule. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that each 't' in the string is a terminal symbol, and each is produced by a specific non-terminal. So each 't75' must come from a production where the non-terminal resolves to that 't75'. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT symbol that directly produces, say, 't75'. The productions start with NT32, etc., but none seem to directly produce a single 't'.\n\nWait, looking closer, I see that NT2\u2192t28, NT23\u2192t34, etc. It seems that some non-terminals can produce a single terminal, like NT31\u2192t35 or NT4\u2192t56. But to get t75, there must be a non-terminal that directly can produce t75, or more likely, that through a series of productions, it can reduce to t75.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of several terminal sequences, each derived from different parts of the grammar. For example, maybe the first part of the string comes from expanding S into NT32 NT14, which then each expand into more NT symbols until they produce terminals, which eventually match the string.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think about each t as a single terminal, so the grammar must have production rules for each of these. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT symbols that directly produce any of the t's in the string, like t75, t49, etc. So if none of the NT symbols directly produce these, perhaps it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string containing these t's as single terminals.\n\nWait, but I'm probably missing something. Let's think: in the grammar, NT32 can produce NT7 NT32, and NT7 can produce 't1'. So how can you get 't75' then? Let's say S \u2192 NT32 NT14 \u2192 (NT7 NT32) (something else). Then NT7 would be 't1', and then NT32 would split again. It might not lead to t75 unless there's a chain that eventually leads to that t.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string cannot be derived because each t is an individual terminal, but the grammar doesn't have any non-terminals that directly produce them. So if your string contains any terminal symbol that isn't produced by any NT symbol, it can't be derived.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where an NT symbol directly becomes a t. So t75, t49, etc., are not produced by any NT symbol. They must be 'reachable' through a series of productions, but in the given grammar, it's unclear if any NT can produce them. So perhaps it's impossible for this string to be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo I think the string isn't generated by this grammar because the grammar doesn't have any NT symbols that directly produce the 't' followed by numbers in the string, hence making it impossible to derive those terms.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which makes things a bit easier because all the productions are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n`t75 t49 t78 t1 t1 t1 t1 t3 t26 t15 t77 t69 t15 t15 t26 t77 t3 t64 t74 t1 t3 t42 t43 t46 t84 t68 t40 t77 t78 t78 t40 t26 t68 t65 t69 t74 t65 t69`\n\nFirst, I should note that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals and productions that produce terminal symbols. The string is composed of these terminals, so the parser will need to follow the derivation steps to see if it can match the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals immediately produce a terminal. For example, `S \u2192 NT32 NT14` and each of `NT1`, `NT2`, etc., have productions that result directly in terminals. So, starting with S, which is the start symbol, it must produce either `NT32 NT14` or `NT18 NT32`.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is `t75`, which suggests we need to trace back which production leads to `t75`. From the grammar, looking for `t75`, I see that `NT24 \u2192 t75` is a production. But `NT24` can be derived from other non-terminals, such as `NT13 \u2192 NT9 NT28`, which then can derive into terms. However, since `t75` is a direct production from `NT24`, that's a leaf node.\n\nSo, starting from the beginning of the string, we need to see if `t75` can be the first output. But looking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces either `NT32 NT14` or `NT18 NT32`. The first symbol is `t75`, which is a terminal, so we must figure out which non-terminal it comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that `t75` is the production of `NT24`. So, for the first token to be `t75`, one of the non-terminals in the left-hand side of the grammar must directly produce `t75`. Checking the grammar, indeed, `NT24 \u2192 t75` is a production.\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the structure? Since S starts with either `NT32 NT14` or `NT18 NT32`, and non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals, we might need to see if `t75` is the result of expanding `NT32`, `NT14`, or so.\n\nBut perhaps the approach is to parse the string step by step, using the grammar. Starting with S, which can go to either `NT32 NT14` or `NT18 NT32`. Let's see which one could generate the string.\n\nThe string starts with `t75`. Let's see which non-terminals have `t75` as a production. Only `NT24 \u2192 t75`. So, for the first step, `S` must produce something that includes `NT24` as one of the non-terminals. But looking at the productions from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, from S, each component is a non-terminal. If the first symbol is `t75`, which comes from `NT24`, then perhaps the first part of the S production must derive to `t75`.\n\nLooking at the first production of S: `NT32 NT14`. So, if `NT32` can produce `t75`, but checking the grammar, I don't see `NT32` directly producing `t75`. From the grammar, `NT24 \u2192 t75`, but `NT32` doesn't have a production that directly leads to `t75`.\n\nWait, no. Let's look. The productions for NT32 are:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT32 is present, but none of the NT32 productions directly produce terminals except for the ones that end with t75, like NT24 \u2192 t75. But NT32 itself doesn't directly produce a terminal. It only produces combinations like NT2 NT22, etc. So, `NT32` cannot produce `t75` directly. It must come from some other non-terminal that eventually leads to `t75`.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the grammar. The production `NT24 \u2192 t75` is present, but `NT32` doesn't have a production for `t75`. So, the initial S production is `NT32 NT14`. For `t75` to be the first symbol, `NT32` must derive into `t75`. But since `NT32` doesn't have a direct production for `t75`, this suggests that the initial production from S must go to `NT18 NT32` instead of `NT32 NT14` because `NT18` might have a path to produce `t75`.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that: The initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. The first token is `t75`, which comes from `NT24`. So, perhaps, looking deeper, `NT24` is derived from either NT30 or NT24 itself.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach this by parsing the entire string step by step, using the grammar.\n\nGiven that the string starts with `t75`, and `t75` is produced directly by `NT24`, let's see if `t75` can be the first symbol from S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the first component is NT32. NT32 can produce NT24 NT17 (from `NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17`), and NT24 \u2192 t75. So, let's see if that can happen.\n\nSo, S can derive into NT32 producing NT24 \u2192 t75, and then NT14 producing something.\n\nWait, but NT14 can produce `t43` or other things. Looking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21 or NT14 \u2192 NT6 NT27 or others. Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21 | NT14 \u2192 NT6 NT27 | NT10 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nWait, actually, under the grammar, NT14 has:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21 | NT14 \u2192 NT6 NT27.\n\nBut also, other productions under NT14: \n\nLooking back at the grammar, it's a bit tangled because it's long. Let's see if there's a direct path from NT14 to a terminal.\n\nFrom the given grammar, NT14 can produce `t43` if there's a production like NT14 \u2192 t43. Looking through the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t56, but that's other NT4 productions.\n\nWait, let me check again. In the grammar, is there any production of NT14 that directly results in a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production where NT14 directly goes to a terminal. Hmm, that's a problem. So, if NT14 cannot directly produce `t75` since `t75` is NT24's production, and NT14 can't produce `t75` directly, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I've misassigned the first token. Perhaps the first `t75` comes from NT24, but looking at the S production, if S is NT32 NT14, then the first component must be NT32, which must produce something leading to `t75`. But in the grammar, `NT32` can't directly produce `t75`. It can only produce the combinations listed, so perhaps this approach isn't working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see if `t75` can be produced by another non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-717","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. This feels a bit daunting because CNGrammars can be tricky, especially with many productions and terminals scattered throughout. Let me start breaking it down.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. This grammar seems to follow CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string given is: `t75 t26 t1 t28 t1 t46 t78 t43 t70 t78 t43 t21 t74 t69 t74 t77 t1 t1 t1 t63 t21 t74 t80 t78 t78 t80 t1 t68 t69 t74 t1 t68 t71 t1 t69 t74 t69`. It's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which are likely the terminals in the grammar.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Given that the grammar uses only S and various non-terminals, I'll have to see how the string can be broken down into productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two main productions:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, after S, it's split into S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. But looking closer, the NT symbols seem to be another layer of non-terminals. For example, NT32 and NT14 might be terminals, but let me check the productions for NT32.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT32 \u2192 NT14 NT23. Hmm, no, more accurately, looking at all the productions, I see that many are of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyy NTzz. So, this is a recursive structure where each NT symbol branches into two other NT symbols, except for the terminal symbols, which point directly to a 't' followed by a number.\n\nMy first step is to identify which NT symbols are terminals. Each terminal is a production that directly results in a 't' followed by a number (e.g., t7, t32, etc.). From the grammar, any NT symbol with a production that goes to a single terminal (like NT15 \u2192 't71') is a terminal. Similarly, any NT symbol that splits into other NT symbols is a non-terminal in the intermediate steps.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals. The task is to see if this sequence can be generated by combining the productions.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start production. The start symbol is S. Looking at the two options for S, it branches into two NT symbols. So, S must be the first production, leading to two branches. Each branch then has to derive a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with t75. Looking into the grammar, which NTs produce t75? Checking all the productions, I see NT2 \u2192 't78', NT1 \u2192 't6', etc. Wait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't78' (Wait, actually, in the productions given, I don't see NT2 directly producing t75. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT31 \u2192 't69', NT24 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, but none jumps out as directly producing t75. Wait, no\u2014a closer look: looking at the bottom of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT23 \u2192 't59'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't21'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't56'\n\nSo, looking at NT32: Is there any NT32 in the productions? Yes, in the initial S production: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's list all the terminal symbols in the string. They are:\n\nt75, t26, t1, t28, t1, t46, t78, t43, t70, t78, t43, t21, t74, t69, t74, t77, t1, t1, t1, t63, t21, t74, t80, t78, t78, t80, t1, t68, t69, t74, t1, t68, t71, t1, t69, t74, t69.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so each must come from a production that ends in a single terminal symbol.\n\nConsidering that, each terminal in the string must be generated by a production of NTxxx \u2192 't' followed by a number. So, to map each 'tX' to an NTxxx production.\n\nHowever, perhaps a better approach is to see if the entire string can be represented by a series of non-terminals that expand into these terminals. For example, starting from S and expanding step by step.\n\nBut let's see: the first symbol is t75. Looking for an NT75, but in the grammar, I don't see any NT75 production. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each NT:\n\nFrom the grammar, the NT symbols are defined like this. For example, NT24 has multiple productions, but no NT75. So perhaps t75 is not directly produced by any NT. That could mean the string can't be generated because there's no NT that produces t75. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I have to make sure. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, for each NT:\n\n- NT32: Does NT32 produce any terminal? Let me check. NT32 appears in productions as NT24 \u2192 NT32 NT14 (No, that's a production where NT24 is split into NT32 and NT14. So, looking through all the NT symbols in the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't75' as a terminal. Therefore, the first symbol t75 can't be generated by any production, which means the string isn't part of the language.\n\nThus, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies certain aspects of parsing. The string given is a sequence of symbols starting with 't75' and ending with 't68', and in between, a lot of other 't's followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like every symbol on the left side of the production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right, except for those that produce terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Wait, no, some of the rules like S -> NT32 NT32 have two non-terminals. But some other rules like S -> NT32 NT14 seem to produce non-terminals as well. So the start symbol S can produce non-terminals until it reaches a terminal symbol.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't75', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I need to find which production rule leads to 't75'. Scanning through, I see that NT32 -> 't75' is a production. So if NT32 can derive 't75', that's a good start.\n\nBreaking down the string, the first symbol is 't75', so I look for where 't75' is produced. From the grammar, NT32 can produce 't75'. So after 't75', we expect another symbol. The next part is 't1'. Looking at the grammar, NT1 is known to produce 't6'. So perhaps NT23 and NT14 are involved?\n\nWait, the string begins with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So the initial production is S splitting into two parts: NT32 and NT14. NT32 gives 't75', so that's good, and NT14 should produce the rest of the string after 't75'.\n\nLooking at NT14, in the grammar, NT14 can produce 't43' or other non-terminals. From the string, after 't75' comes 't1', which is 't1'. Wait, 't1' is produced by NT7. But in the production rules, NT14 produces 't43' or maybe other non-terminals? Alternatively, perhaps I need to backtrack.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to figure out how each part of the string is derived. Let's take the first few tokens: 't75', 't1', 't28', 't69', 't74', 't43', etc.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. NT32 \u2192 't75'. Now, what does NT14 produce? In the grammar, NT14 can produce 't43' directly or via another production. Let's see, looking at the rules, NT14 has S -> NT32 NT14, which is a left recursion. But in this context, since we have S producing NT14, and NT14 may have other productions, perhaps we can find a way to match.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT14 is present in some production rules, but looking for NT14 in the left-hand side of the productions, I see something like NT2 -> NT22 NT15, but not NT14. Let me check again. Oh, there's a production NT14 -> NT31 NT21. So NT14 can generate non-terminals, which would produce more symbols. This might mean that NT14 is part of a recursive structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT14 can directly produce 't43' because in the grammar, there is a production NT14 -> 't43'. Let me check that rule. Yes, in the grammar, NT14 can be 't43' directly. So after 't75' (from NT32), the next symbol should come from NT14. The next token is 't1'. Wait, that's 't1', but NT14's productions don't include 't1'. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. S starts with NT32 NT14. NT32 gives 't75'. NT14 needs to produce the rest of the string starting from the second token. But the second token is 't1', which is 't1'. So I need to see where 't1' comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT7 -> 't1'. So perhaps NT14 must produce 't1' and more. But in the grammar, NT14 can produce 't43' directly or through NT31 NT21.\n\nWait, perhaps S produces NT32 NT14, which gives 't75' followed by NT14. NT14 can produce 't43', but in the string, after 't75' comes 't1', so maybe that's not the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which then leads to 't75' and another part. Maybe the NT14 is part of a larger structure. Let me see if there's any NT7 in the production that leads to 't1'.\n\nLooking again, NT7 appears in several production rules, such as NT7 -> NT23 NT5, and NT23 -> 't34', etc. Hmm, so perhaps the derivation is more complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try building the parse tree step by step. Start with the entire string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar, ending up at S.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or use the pumping lemma, but since it's a context-free grammar, maybe the string is too long to be in the language, especially considering the number of terminals, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look at the initial part and see where it might go. The string starts with 't75 t1 t28 t69 ...'. We know that 't75' comes from NT32 \u2192 't75'. So after 't75', the next symbol should come from NT14.\n\nLooking at NT14, possible productions: NT14 -> NT31 NT21 or NT14 -> 't43'. So the second symbol is 't1', which is 't1' from NT7 \u2192 't1'. But NT14 can't directly produce 't1'. Alternatively, perhaps after NT14, it goes into some other production.\n\nWait, maybe NT14 can't directly produce 't1'; perhaps the initial assumption about the production S \u2192 NT32 NT14 is correct, but the rest of NT14's production leads to a different path. Let me try to find a way NT14 can derive a string starting with 't1'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT14 is present in several rule right-hand sides, like S -> NT32 NT14 and NT24 -> NT4 NT1. Not directly leading to 't1'. Alternatively, perhaps looking for 't1' in the non-terminals, but I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't1' besides NT7.\n\nWait, maybe I need to backtrack. Let's see: the string starts with 't75', which is correct from NT32. The next symbol is 't1', which must come from NT14. But since NT14 doesn't directly produce 't1', perhaps I'm missing a production. Looking again, I don't see any production for NT14 that starts with 't1' except for perhaps through a series of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe the initial production isn't S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but something else. Wait, in the grammar, the first production starts with S -> NT32 NT14, and the second is S -> NT18 NT32. So maybe the entire string isn't being derived from just S's first production.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't75', which would have to come from NT32. So maybe the initial split is correct, and the rest comes from NT14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the string isn't compatible because 't1' comes too early. Let me consider the steps again:\n\n1. Start with S, which splits into NT32 and NT14.\n2. NT32 produces 't75'.\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-733","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t75 t69 t1 t78 t35 t69 t21 t1 t1 t15 t68 t15 t68 t1 t65 t63 t77 t69 t1 t15 t1 t80 t69 t74 t74 t77 t78 t69 t74 t78 t40 t15 t77 t69 t15 t46 t19 t42 t69`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should simplify things a bit because each production rule either produces a terminal or splits the string into two parts.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only starting symbol is S. Let's see the productions for S: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So, the start symbol S eventually produces these two parts, each of which will be non-terminals that will expand into more parts.\n\nNow, the string starts with `t75`, which I assume is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see several production rules that end with 't', like NT3 -> 't1', NT4 -> 't56', and others. So, the string is composed of terminals which are generated by the non-terminals.\n\nI'll need to see if the string can be broken down into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions. Let's start by breaking the string into components separated by spaces. There are 40 symbols in the string, which is a lot, but let's see if we can work through it.\n\nFirst, looking at the string: the first token is t75. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT32 -> 't75'. So, t75 is produced by NT32. That means one of the parts after expanding S will have to include NT32 as a production. \n\nLet me consider the two options for S: S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. So, if the string starts with t75, which is from NT32, then the first part after S would be NT32, and the second part would be NT14. But looking at the string, the second token is t69. So, we'd need to check if the expansion of NT32 (which leads to t75) followed by NT14 leads to t69. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step. Let's consider each part of the string as a result of expanding non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t75. Since t75 is a terminal, it must come from a production rule that directly outputs t75. Looking at the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't75', and NT32 -> 't75'. So either NT32 or NT0 can produce t75. But since NT0 is a non-terminal, and we have to expand it, perhaps t75 is from NT32.\n\nLet me suppose that the first part is NT32 which gives t75. Then the next part would be NT14. So, we need NT14 to produce the next part of the string, which is t69.\n\nLooking up NT14 in the grammar, the productions are NT14 -> NT31 NT21 and another NT14 -> 't43'. Wait, does NT14 have a production that includes t69? Let me check the grammar again. No, NT21 is mentioned, and it has a production that can lead to t69.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's map the string into parts. After t75, the next is t69, which suggests the next production is NT32 -> t75, and then NT14 -> ... which must produce t69. Let's see: NT14 can produce t43 directly, but t43 isn't in the string. Alternatively, NT14 can be split into NT31 NT21. So, maybe NT14 splits into NT31 (which can produce more terminals) and NT21.\n\nLooking at NT31's productions, I see NT31 -> 't69', 't35', etc. So if NT31 can produce t69, then that fits the next token as t69. Alternatively, NT31 could produce a split. Let's think: maybe NT14 is split into NT31 (to produce t69) and NT21 (which might produce something else, but in this case, it's the end of the first part after t75 t69, so maybe NT21 isn't needed here. Or perhaps it's a terminal). \n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with t75: that must come from either NT32 or NT0. Let's assume it's from NT32, which is the first option S -> NT32 NT14. Now, the next part is t69, which would come from NT14. Do we have any production that directly gives t69? Looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for a single terminal t69. Instead, NT31 produces t69, and NT30 can go to t63, etc. So perhaps t69 comes from NT31.\n\nSo, let's see: NT14 -> NT31 NT21. So, NT31 can produce t69. So that works. Now, the next part after t75 t69 is t1. So, after producing t75 (from NT32) and t69 (from NT31), what's next?\n\nWait, the string is t75 t69 t1... So, after NT14 (which is S's second part in this case) has expanded into NT31 NT21 (which is t69 and then ...), what comes next in the string is t1, which is from NT3 or something. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a production NT3 -> 't1', so t1 comes from NT3.\n\nSo, after the initial S splits into NT32 and NT14, which splits into t75 and NT14, which splits into NT31 (t69) and NT21. Now, the next token is t1, which would need to come from NT21 splitting or NT3. But NT21's productions are not direct terminals. Let me check: NT21 appears in NT24 -> NT24 NT21, and in other places. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after NT31, the next part is NT21, which might expand further.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to try to walk through the string and see if each step corresponds to a production rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down parsing approach would help. Starting with S, which can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's pick the first option: NT32 and NT14.\n\nNT32 can be t75, so the string starts with t75. Then, NT14 can be either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since t69 is next, and NT14 splits into NT31 and NT21, NT31 can be t69, so that fits.\n\nNow, after t75 t69, the next token is t1. So, the next expansion would come from NT31 which is t69, and then the next part is what comes from NT21, which is the next element.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's try another approach. Maybe write down the entire string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt75 t69 t1 t78 t35 t69 t21 t1 t1 t15 t68 t15 t68 t1 t65 t63 t77 t69 t1 t15 t1 t80 t69 t74 t74 t77 t78 t69 t74 t78 t40 t15 t77 t69 t15 t46 t19 t42 t69.\n\nThat's quite a long list. Let's break it into smaller parts. Each production in the grammar either introduces a terminal or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S, which may be NT32 NT14. Let's see if the string can be generated by this.\n\nFirst, NT32 can be t75. So the string starts with t75.\n\nNext, NT14 can be split into NT31 NT21. NT31 can be t69, so that's t69 next.\n\nNow, the string is t75 t69. The next token is t1.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what can produce t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, any string derived from S must be structured according to these rules.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't75 t74 ...'. These seem to be terminal symbols. My first thought is to break down the string into chunks that might correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions are combinations of non-terminals like NT32, NT14, etc., and some are terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, which would translate to a string starting with 't75' 't74' if I'm reading correctly, but I need to verify which non-terminals correspond to which terminals.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have production rules where most right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals except for a few, like some rules produce a single terminal symbol (e.g., NT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', etc.).

I'll try to break it down into possible sequences that could come from the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which can produce two different sequences. The first option is NT32 followed by NT14, and the second is NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are 't75 t74'. Let's see what NT32 and NT14 might correspond to. From the grammar, NT32 is present in several productions, but looking specifically, it's part of S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So perhaps the first part of the string is derived from S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nNT32 could be 't75'. Let me check the rules for NT32. Looking through the rules, NT32 isn't directly a terminal, but it's part of other productions. Wait, but some productions have NT32 on the right-hand side. For example, NT7 \u2192 't1' and other rules. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For example, NT15 can produce 't71', 't35', etc. Similarly, NT32 might produce a terminal. Looking back, in the grammar, I see NT32 \u2192 't75' (looking at the lines: NT15 \u2192 't71', but the other NT32 is in NT15 \u2192 't71', so maybe I need to look for where NT32 itself is a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT32 directly as a terminal. Instead, NT32 appears in the productions for other non-terminals, but I need to check if any non-terminals produce 't75'.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm getting the non-terminals mixed up with the terminals. Let's re-examine the given grammar:\n\nI see NT15 \u2192 't71' and NT15 \u2192 't35', so 't71' and 't35' are directly produced by NT15. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't1', etc. But in the string, I have 't75', 't74', etc. Do these correspond to any non-terminals? \n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT32 is in NT15 \u2192 't71' and others, but does any non-terminal produce 't75'? Hmm. Looking at the production rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't1', NT9 \u2192 't49', NT17 \u2192 't68', and so on. 't75' is produced by NT32 in this case because in the productions, NT32 is in NT15\u2019s productions, but maybe I'm not seeing it correctly.\n\nWait, let me list out all the terminals in the grammar. The grammar has several NT rules that eventually lead to 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't1'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77'\n- NT8 \u2192 't46'\n- NT24 \u2192 't79', etc.\n\nSo, each of these non-terminals eventually resolve to some 'tX' symbol, where X is a number. Our task is to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't75 t74 t77 t78 t69 t69 t78 t80 t26 t1 t78 t80 t1 t68 t46 t78 t43 t21 t26 t74 t68 t84 t15 t68 t71 t78 t78 t1 t1 t15 t1 t26 t43 t69 t78 t43 t21 t26 t15 t69'\n\nI think I should start by trying to parse this string according to the grammar. Let's try to find the start symbol S, which is made up of either S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nIf I consider the first option, S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then the production should be a string starting with NT32 followed by NT14. So, we can try to match the beginning of the string to NT32 and NT14.\n\nBut I need to know what NT32 and NT14 produce. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT14 as a terminal. Instead, NT14 appears in S's productions, so it's a non-terminal. So, NT14 must produce some terminals. Let's see, perhaps NT14 can be further split into other non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's approach this step by step. Perhaps using a parsing strategy like recursive descent or memoization, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can try to write out the entire string as a sequence of non-terminals, each eventually resolving to the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the entire string for consistency with any possible derivation starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to just look for the structure of the string and see if it can be broken down into the left-hand sides of the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt75 t74 t77 t78 t69 t69 t78 t80 t26 t1 t78 t80 t1 t68 t46 t78 t43 t21 t26 t74 t68 t84 t15 t68 t71 t78 t78 t1 t1 t15 t1 t26 t43 t69 t78 t43 t21 t26 t15 t69.\n\nLet me count the number of 't's: the string is quite long, but I'll assume it's correctly split into individual 't' followed by a number symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I can break the string into possible chunks corresponding to the non-terminals, starting from the start.\n\nLet me attempt to write down possible derivations. Starting from S, we can generate two options: path 1 is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and path 2 is S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nThe first option (path 1) would mean the string starts with NT32 followed by NT14. Let's see if the first part of the string can be derived from NT32 NT14.\n\nBut to do that, I need to check what NT32 and NT14 produce. However, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT32 being a terminal; instead, it's part of other productions. So perhaps NT32 is a non-terminal that can produce other non-terminals, which eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing using the CYK algorithm. The string to evaluate is: \n\n`t75 t53 t26 t15 t46 t19 t15 t65 t69 t26 t40 t35 t69 t78 t40 t78 t43 t78 t80 t78 t35 t69 t21 t3 t1 t1 t3 t69 t74 t77 t26 t69 t26 t42 t70 t74 t77 t69 t32 t69`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what the Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, or a single terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit CNF because all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string provided has all terminals, so the grammar is generating a sequence of terminals. I think the approach here is to derive the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and expanding the non-terminals to terminals until I get the string.\n\nThe grammar is quite large, so I'll need to find a systematic way to approach this. Maybe I can work backwards by trying to match the string from the end, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I could try to find the production rules that lead to the terminals in the string, seeing if each part of the string can be matched by such expansions.\n\nLet me first list out the possible non-terminals and their production rules to see if I can spot any patterns or connections.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string: `t75 t53 t26 t15...`. I notice that the grammar has specific rules where some non-terminals resolve directly to a terminal. For example, NT32 \u2192 t75. So, part of the string starts with `t75`, which must come from NT32.\n\nLooking further, NT32 has one production rule: S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Wait, actually, the grammar is presented with multiple production rules. Let me check: S can produce NT32 NT32 (from the first rule?), no, in the input, the grammar is S -> NT32 NT32? Wait, no, looking back, the first grammar rule is S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then S \u2192 NT18 NT32. That's it for S.\n\nWait, no. Looking again, the grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT32? Or is it S \u2192 NT32 NT14 as the first rule, then S \u2192 NT18 NT32 as the second rule. Let me count the number of entries under S:\n\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\nWait, no, that's only two lines. So, S can produce either NT32 NS14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, the start symbol S has two options. Let's consider the first option: S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t75, which must come from NT32 because one of the production rules for NT32 is NT32 \u2192 t75. So NT32 can derive t75. Then, the next part is NT14. Let's see what NT14 can derive.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT14 has two production rules: NT14 can be \u2192 t43 or NT31 NT7. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\nNT14 -> t43\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\nNT14 -> t43\n\nSo, NT14 has two options: produce t43 directly or produce the combination of NT31 and NT21. Since the next term after t75 is t53, let's see.\n\nWait, the string is: t75, t53, t26, etc. So after t75, we need to get t53. So, the NT14 must produce t43, which is 't43', but that doesn't match t53. Alternatively, perhaps it's NT14 \u2192 t53? Let me check. In the grammar, I don't see a rule NT14 \u2192 t53. Only t43.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let's think differently: perhaps the first production for S is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's try that.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then the first part is NT18 and the second is NT32. Let's see what NT18 can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT18 has the production rule NT18 \u2192 t80. So, NT18 can produce t80. The string starts with t75, so that's a problem. Maybe the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, NT32 produces t75, and then NT14 must produce t53.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar for NT14: NT14's rules are\u2192 t43 or NT31 NT7. So, unless NT31 or NT7 can produce t53, this doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about how the string is being generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT14 is more complex. Let me check all the rules for NT14 again:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\nNT14 -> t43\n\nSo, NT14 can only produce t43 or the combination of NT31 and NT21. There's no direct route to produce 't53' from NT14. So perhaps the initial part of the string may not be starting with t75. Maybe I need to see if another production of S can lead to the string.\n\nLet me check the other production of S: S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, if the first part is NT18, it produces t80, and then NT32 can produce t75. Then the string starts with t80 t75..., which doesn't match because the string starts with t75 t53. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, this suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, or maybe I'm missing something. Another approach is to try to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals into terminals and see if it all matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol is 't75', so let's see if 't75' can be produced directly. Yes, NT32 can produce t75.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, the first part is NT32, which is t75, and the next is NT14.\n\nSo, after t75, the next part of the string is t53, t26, etc. So, NT14 must produce t53 as the next symbol. But according to the grammar, NT14 can only produce t43 or NT31 NT21. There is no production for NT14 directly producing t53. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because t53 cannot be derived from any rule of NT14.\n\nWait, but that's a big jump. Let me double-check the grammar. Looking again, in the grammar:\n\nNT14 is defined as:\nNT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21\nNT14 \u2192 t43\n\nSo, there is no production that produces 't53' directly or indirectly. So, the string starts with t75, then t53, which cannot be obtained from NT14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking up NT14's productions. Let me recount the grammar:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the lines under NT14 are:\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT7\nNT14 -> NT21 NT28\nWait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, let me go through each line in the grammar as provided.\n\nThe grammar has:\n\n...\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT23 -> 't59'\nNT31 -> 't69'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT23 -> 't21'\nNT29 -> 't28'\nNT24 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't68'\nNT19 -> 't1'\nNT28 -> 't82'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75'\nNT2 -> 't80'\n...\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production for NT14 is:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I think I might have made a mistake in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-775","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way a context-free grammar is structured, which makes it easier to perform certain analyses, like using the CYK algorithm for parsing. \n\nThe grammar provided is a bit complex, so I should probably look for patterns or rules that can help simplify my approach. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar. \n\nCNF grammars have the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. The given grammar seems to follow CNF since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides have two parts\u2014either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t75 t26 t15 t1 t25 t49 t80 t43 t59 t43 t34 t46 t84 t46 t32 t74 t43 t22 t69 t69 t34 t69 t74 t80 t69 t74 t42 t78 t80 t26 t74 t1 t69 t74 t69 t74 t77 t69 t71 t69 t69`. \n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string consists entirely of terminal symbols (all the 't' followed by numbers). The grammar allows for some non-terminals, like S, NT30, NT4, etc., but the terminal symbols in the string are 't' followed by various numbers. I need to figure out if this string can be derived by the grammar starting from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at how the grammar is structured, it's clear that the start symbol is S, which has two productions: S \u2192 NT32 NT14 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So the initial string from S would be two non-terminals, which would then expand into more non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nBut looking at the string given, it's a series of 't's and numbers, so the first step is to see if it starts with either NT32 or NT18 NT32. Wait, no, the first rule of S is to produce NT32 NT14. So the first part of the string should start with NT32 and NT14.\n\nWait, the string starts with t75, which looks like a terminal. Then t26, t15, etc. I'm not sure what 't75' corresponds to in the grammar. I think the terminals in the grammar are the 't's with numbers, which are defined by the rules. So each 't' corresponds to a terminal production.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by breaking down the string into its components and see how they could be generated from the start symbol.\n\nFirst, let me list the components of the string in order:\n\nt75, t26, t15, t1, t25, t49, t80, t43, t59, t43, t34, t46, t84, t46, t32, t74, t43, t22, t69, t69, t34, t69, t74, t80, t69, t74, t42, t78, t80, t26, t74, t1, t69, t74, t69, t74, t77, t69, t71, t69, t69.\n\nThat's a lot of 't's. Each of these must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar, so each must be derived directly from the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have production rules that include terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 't71' and 't35', NT23 \u2192 't34', etc. So each of these non-terminals can produce a single terminal.\n\nSo, to generate the string, we'd start with S, which splits into two non-terminals. Let's say we take the production S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Then, both NT32 and NT14 need to be expanded until they reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT32, I see that it can be NT3 NT30, or maybe it has other productions, but the first option seems more likely. Wait, let me check:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17 (from the grammar). Hmm, wait, looking back, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT32 has two productions:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17\nNT32 \u2192 NT4 NT32\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. No, that's probably incorrect. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT32 -> NT24 NT17\n\nWait, that's one production. The list continues, for example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT31 NT6 (and other rules for NT24). Hmm, but NT32 only appears in some rules. Wait, looking more carefully, it seems that NT32 might have multiple rules, but I'm not seeing it. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nSo, first, S can produce NT32 and NT14. NT32 has multiple productions, but let's check.\n\nLooking at NT32, the productions are:\n\nNT32 -> NT24 NT17\nNT32 -> NT4 NT32\n\nWait, that can't be right. No, because when I look at the grammar, under NT32, there's:\n\nNT32 -> NT24 NT17\nNT32 -> NT4 NT32\n\nWait, that's incorrect because NT32 can't have two productions; each line is an alternative. So, the first line for NT32 is:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17\n\nThe next line is for another non-terminal, perhaps. Let me make sure. Looking at the grammar, after NT32, the next line is:\n\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo NT32's productions are:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT24 NT17\nNT32 \u2192 NT3 NT32\n\nWait, no, that's not possible. Wait, looking at the complete grammar, the lines go in order, each starting with a capital letter.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is pretty long, so I'll need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides consist of two non-terminals or a mix of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like `t75 t1 t3 ... t25 ...`. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production can only generate exactly two symbols at each step. So, the entire string must be a derivation where each step appends two symbols, with non-terminals expanding into terminals and possibly other non-terminals, each step doubling the length.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a leftmost derivation of CNF, each production replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, so starting from the start symbol S, each application of a production would increase the string length by one (since S -> NT1 NT2 replaces S with two symbols, so the length goes from 1 to 2). But here, the grammar has only two productions starting with S: S \u2192 NT30 NT32 and S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Both replace S with two non-terminals.\n\nBut the given string has a lot of terminals, so I'll need to see if each part of the string can be broken down into factors that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, another approach is to parse the string top-down using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm, but given the string's length, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can spot-check certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the entire string can be generated by following the productions step by step, ensuring that every step only uses two symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which can produce NT30 NT32 or NT18 NT32. So the first part of the string should start with either NT30 NT32 or NT18 NT32.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt75 t1 t3 t78 t80 t1 t15 t3 t78 t6 t65 t74 t77 t74 t69 t53 t69 t69 t26 t78 t35 t69 t19 t78 t22 t69 t34 t1 t69 t74 t68 t32 t42 t43 t68 t1 t68 t25 t43 t69 t69.\n\nLet's parse this into chunks of two, but wait, in a CFG in CNF, each production is a non-terminal expanding into two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. So the entire string must be generated by expanding non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut since the given string is all terminals, we need to see if it can be decomposed into the grammar's productions.\n\nBut the string starts with t75, which must come from a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, let's see which non-terminals expand into t75.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT33 \u2192 t52, but that's not helpful. Wait, no, looking for terminals in the right-hand sides. Wait, actually, in the grammar, many rules end with a single terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT15 \u2192 't35'\nNT15 \u2192 't33'\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, each rule ends with a single terminal. Therefore, in the string, each terminal corresponds to a leaf in the parse tree.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, the string must be a full leftmost derivation, which would result in a string where each non-terminal expansion adds two symbols. So, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, and each step replacing a single non-terminal with two symbols.\n\nWait, but the initial S is replaced by two non-terminals (either NT30 NT32 or NT18 NT32). So the string after the first step would have two symbols, which must match the first two symbols of the string. But in the given string, the first part is t75, which isn't a terminal we see in any production. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, 't75' only appears in NT25 \u2192 't77' and other places. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules, 't75' appears only once in NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, the only way to get 't75' is from NT32.\n\nSo the first symbol in the string is 't75', which can only be generated by NT32 expanding to 't75' alone? Wait, no, because in CNF, each production for a non-terminal is exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So if NT32 has a production that ends with 't75', perhaps 't75' is the result of NT32 being replaced in a production where it expands to 't75' as one symbol, which is not possible because in CNF, each production must expand into exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. If NT32 has a production rule that directly produces 't75', then that's possible because it could be a rule like NT32 \u2192 't75', which is a single terminal symbol? But actually, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC. So the only way a non-terminal can produce a single terminal is if it has a production like A \u2192 a, but the given grammar seems to have all productions as A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for one production where NT32 \u2192 't75'. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\nNT15 \u2192 't71'\nNT15 \u2192 't35'\nNT15 \u2192 't33'\nNT19 \u2192 't1'\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\nNT0 \u2192 't40'\nNT24 \u2192 't42'\nBT2 \u2192 't49' and so on.\n\nWait, looking for terminals in the grammar, I see that some rules end with single terminals, like 't75' for NT25 \u2192 't77'? No, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, in the list of rules, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't12'?\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the rules methodically.\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't52'\n- NT31 \u2192 't52' (Wait, no, 't52' is from NT33 and others. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any production where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't71'\n- NT15 \u2192 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't33'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT0 \u2192 't40'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT9 \u2192 't49'\n- NT17 \u2192 't68'\n- NT13 \u2192 't28'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- NT23 \u2192 't70'\n- NT29 \u2192 't28'\n- NT24 \u2192 't42'\n- NT5 \u2192 't68'\n- NT19 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71'\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n\nWait, yes: NT32 \u2192 't75'. So this is a production where a non-terminal expands into a single terminal.\n\nBut in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So, is this allowed? Because in CNF, you can have A \u2192 a, but only if the grammar is written with epsilon productions as well. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have a mix of productions with non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. If the grammar is in CNF, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC. So having a production like NT32 \u2192 't75' would mean it's a single terminal, which would not fit CNF. So maybe the initial assumption that the grammar is in CNF is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the provided grammar has both types"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to analyzing context-free grammars, but I'll do my best to figure this out. \n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form. CNF means every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all rules seem to fit this form, so that's good. The string we're checking is a series of 't's followed by numbers, like 't75 t35...' so I'm thinking the terminals here are these 't' followed by numbers. \n\nThe question is whether this string can be generated by the given grammar. To determine this, I'll need to check if the string can be broken down into the productions of the grammar. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to look for the start symbol S and see how it can generate the string. The start symbol is S, so the string must be a derivation starting from S. \n\nLooking at the initial productions of S, there are two options:\n1. S \u2192 NT32 NT14\n2. S \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSince the string starts with 't75', I need to see if any of these can produce a 't' followed by a number. However, NT32 and NT14 are both non-terminals, so they need to be expanded further. \n\nLet me check the rules for NT32 and NT18. \n\nNT32 has the following productions:\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT2\n- NT32 \u2192 't75' \u2192 Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT32's productions. Actually, let me scan through all NT rules to find where 't's appear as terminals. \n\nWait, I notice that some non-terminals have terminals in their productions. For example, NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21, but also NT31 \u2192 't69' etc. Hmm, I realize I missed the terminals in the earlier glance. \n\nSo, looking back, the string starts with 't75'. I should check if any NT's rule ends with 't75'. Let's go through the non-terminals:\n\n- NT32: I see NT32 \u2192 't75'\u2014yes, there's a rule where NT32 directly produces 't75'.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't40', and other NT's have terminals as well. So, if I can trace the string through the grammar, using these rules that produce the 't's, that would help.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT32 NT14. Now, NT32 can produce 't75', so that's the first 't75'. Now, after that, we have NT14. What about NT14? Looking at the rules, NT14 \u2192 't43'\u2014so another terminal. So if I take that, the next part would be 't43' as the second element. But in the string, after 't75' comes 't35', so this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So S \u2192 NT32 NT14 would give me 't75' followed by 't43', but the string starts with 't75 t35', which doesn't match. So maybe S \u2192 NT32 NT14 isn't the right path.\n\nBut wait, maybe after NT32, which produces 't75', there's another possibility. Let me see if NT14 can produce something else. In the rules, NT14 \u2192 't43' and also other productions that are non-terminals. So, if I choose NT14 \u2192 't43', then the string after the first 't75' would be 't43', which doesn't fit the actual string's second element 't35'. So that path doesn't seem to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct initial rule is S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Let's see what NT18 does.\n\nLooking at NT18's rules: I don't see any direct terminal productions, only non-terminals. So if NT18 can't produce a terminal, then this path might not work unless there's an indirect way. Wait, let me recheck: Is there any rule where NT18 directly produces a terminal?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see NT18 \u2192 anything except other non-terminals. So perhaps S \u2192 NT18 NT32 wouldn't help because NT18 can't generate a terminal. Therefore, maybe the initial assumption that the string starts with 't75' can only come from S \u2192 NT32 NT14, but that leads to 't75' followed by 't43', which doesn't match the string.\n\nWait, but let's make sure I didn't miss any terminal productions for NT14 or others. Looking through all the rules again:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT27 NT21, NT19 NT17, NT27 NT30, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT23\n- NT15 \u2192 NT21 NT34, etc. And some have 't's.\n- NT31 has several 't's like 't69', 't28', etc.\n- NT0 has 't40', 't71', etc.\n- NT23 has 't34', etc.\n- NT29 has 't28'\n- NT34 has 't17', etc.\n- NT24 has several 't's like 't75', 't72', etc.\n- NT25 has 't64', etc.\n- NT6 has 't53'\n- NT1 has 't6'\n- NT3 has 't1'\n- Others: NT32 has 't75'; NT30 has 't26'; NT28\u2192 't82', etc.\n\nSo, yes, several NT's can produce terminals. But in the first step, when choosing S\u2192 NT32 NT14, since NT32 can produce 't75', the next part would require NT14 to produce something. However, looking at NT14's rules, the only terminals are 't43' when it produces directly. So the second element would be 't43' instead of 't35', which is present in the string.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the initial assumption about the path S\u2192 NT32 NT14 might not be correct because it leads to 't43', but the string has 't35'. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a way for NT14 to produce 't35' somewhere down the line through multiple expansions.\n\nWait, maybe NT14 can produce a string that includes 't35' as part of its expansion. Let's look at NT14's productions. Looking through all the rules, NT14 is involved in several rules, but none directly produce a terminal apart from 't43'. So perhaps there's no way for NT14 to ultimately generate a 't35' directly or indirectly. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the other initial rule S\u2192 NT18 NT32, then let's see. If S \u2192 NT18 NT32, then NT18 can produce... well, I can't see any terminal for NT18, so it must expand into non-terminals. Let's see what NT18 can do.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT18's productions are all non-terminals except for NT18 \u2192 NT5 \u2192 ??? Wait, looking for NT18's rules. Let me scan the entire list again for NT18:\n\nAh, under the list, I see that NT18 has no direct production to another terminal. The rules are all non-terminals. So S\u2192 NT18 NT32 would require that both NT18 and NT32 produce non-terminals, which would mean that the initial steps wouldn't produce any 't's. But the string starts with 't75', so this path doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for NT's that directly produce a terminal. From the rules, I can list all NT's that have 't' as a terminal:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't75'\n- NT30 \u2192 't26'\n- NT28 \u2192 't82', 't69', 't25'\n- NT24 \u2192 't75', 't72', 't42', 't12', 't53', 't64', 't79', 't69', 't69', 't35', 't56', etc.\n- NT31 \u2192 't69', 't28', 't70', 't22', 't34', 't33', 't13', etc.\n- NT19 \u2192 't1' and 't35'\n- NT15 \u2192 't71', 't68', 't35', 't28', etc.\n- NT23 \u2192 't34', 't30', etc.\n- NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the given grammar, it seems to have all productions in CNF except a few that might produce terminals directly. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions should have two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. But here, some rules are like NTi -> 'tj', which means a terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nNext, to test if the string is in the language, I should parse the string using the given grammar. Parsing can be done via either top-down (using something like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent) or bottom-up (using theleshmite's algorithm). Since I'm not very familiar with the exact steps, I'll try a top-down approach, maybe using recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut recursively parsing this would be time-consuming, and the string is quite long. So maybe I can look for patterns or rules that can help me see if all the symbols in the string can be derived down to the start symbol S.\n\nWait, the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, which looks like the terminals. Each terminal must be matched by a production in the grammar. I need to see if each part of the string can be generated step by step from S.\n\nLet me think about the grammar structure. The grammar has S starting as S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. Each of these NT productions branches out. For example, NT32 can go to NT2 NT22, which might further break down.\n\nBut manually parsing this without a specific algorithm would be challenging. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the productions that lead to terminals and see if the string can be constructed from them.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last part is `t70 t26 t1 t46 t19 t74 t1 t3 t3 t15 t15 t68 t1 t80 t3 t19 t69`. That's a lot of t symbols. Let me pick a part of the string, say a middle segment, to test.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Earley parser approach could help. Earley's algorithm parses context-free grammars by building a predictive parser that tracks possible states. It can handle left and right recursion, but that might complicate things here.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is made up of many t's, maybe it's built from rules that expand into sequences of terminals. For example, some NT productions might directly produce terminals like NT5 \u2192 t68 or NT7 \u2192 t1, so the string's parts like t68 or t1 could come from these.\n\nI think a better approach is to see if the string can be generated by traversing the grammar tree step by step, ensuring that each terminal in the string matches some production's right-hand side.\n\nLet's try to analyze the structure. The string starts with t75, which according to the grammar rules, appears in NT2 \u2192 t53 t3 t69 t70, but looking at the given grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 t49, I think. Wait, let me check the given grammar rules again.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't71'\n\nNT23 \u2192 't21'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, but the terminals in the grammar are:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see lines like NT15 \u2192 't71', NT15 \u2192 't35', NT15 \u2192 't28', etc. So for example, when NT15 expands, it can produce terminals 't71', 't35', or 't28'. So the string part like t71, t35, etc., must come from these productions.\n\nBack to the first part of the string: t75 t74 t77 t40 t1 t46 t40 t42 t71 t26...\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT2 NT22 or NT4 \u2192 NT25 NT6.\n\nWait, let me see if t75 is a terminal. Looking through the given rules, I don't see any NT production that ends with t75. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT32 appears in the production S \u2192 NT32 NT14, and then NT32 has:\n\nLooking back, NT32 is in the original grammar? Wait, the given rules are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\n\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22\n\nNT24 -> NT2 NT13\n\nWait, the user provided a lot more rules, and some of them produce terminals.

Looking for NT rule where the right-hand side ends with t75.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI find NT23 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 't34' (twice?)\n\nBut I don't see any production that ends with t75. Hmm, unless I missed it. Let me go back.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules provided: \n\nHmm, only a few have terminal outputs. For example, NT15 \u2192 't28', 't35', 't71', etc.\n\nIf there's no production that results in 't75', then the string must start with t75, which can't be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, if t75 is generated by some NT production, but in this case, looking at the given rules, I don't see any NT producing t75. Did I miss one?\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't28'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't53'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't40'\n\nWait, no, I don't see any NT rule that ends with t75. So if the first symbol is 't75', then the grammar can't generate it. Thus, the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, I might have made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the list of grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't71', 't35', 't28'\n\nBut where is 't75'? I thought the first symbol is 't75', and if none of the NT rules produce 't75', then the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, if that's the case, the string can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is pretty long, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall how context-free grammars work. Each non-terminal symbol (like S, NT30, NT4, etc.) can be rewritten using the production rules until we reach terminal symbols (like t followed by numbers). The goal is to derive the string using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal symbol and a non-terminal. That should make parsing easier.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals: t75, t74, t77, t40, t69, t74, t42, t19, t78, t1, t1, t15, t1, t1, t77, t69, t1, t63, t1, t1, t26, t77, t26, t80, t74, t78, t1, t1, t42, t19, t69, t74, t77, t69, t69, t74, t1, t63, t68, t1, t82, t69.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a terminal. The initial symbol is S, which has two productions: NT32 NT32 and NT30 NT14. But looking closer, the initial S can produce either NT32 NT32 or NT30 NT14. However, looking at the terminal symbols, the string starts with t75. Let me check which non-terminals can produce t75.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT32 has a production leading to t75: NT32 -> t75. So one of the NT32s must produce this. That suggests that the first part of the string is t75, which comes from NT32.\n\nLet me see the other productions for NT32. Wait, the production is NT32 -> t75, so it only has one possible terminal. So to get t75, we must have a NT32 on the left. So the first symbol t75 must come from the NT32 production.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it's t75 followed by t74, which is a terminal. So let's look at the grammar for t74. Checking the productions, I see NT18 -> t74. So that's another terminal we can get from NT18.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t74, which comes from NT18. But in CNF, to produce t74, we need to have a production of NT18 that leads to t74. Looking at the grammar, there's a production for NT18: NT18 -> NT25 NT14? Wait no, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> NT25 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT24 NT12\n- NT24 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT12 -> NT78\n- And other production rules for NT12, etc. Also, looking for whether ND18 can produce t74.\n\nWait, let me list the terminal productions to see what they go to:\n\n- NT32 -> t75\n- NT18 -> t74\n- NT23 -> t34\n- NT0 -> t71 (twice)\n- NT2 -> t80\n- NT4 -> t56\n- Also, some NTs produce other NTs with two symbols.\n\nWait, so NT18 can produce t74 via the production NT18 -> t74. So that's how we get t74 in the string.\n\nSo the first step is S -> NT32 NT32. Because the string starts with t75, which is from NT32. So the first production is NT32 -> t75. Then the next is the same: but wait, the string is t75 followed by t74. Let me think.\n\nWait, the initial S can produce two possible NT32 or NT30 and NT14. Hmm, no, the initial S's productions are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT30 NT14\n\nSo depending on which one is chosen, we get different starting points.\n\nBut since the string starts with t75, which is from NT32, we must take the first production S -> NT32 NT32.\n\nSo the first symbol comes from NT32, which is t75. Then, what comes next is t74, which would be from the next NT32 or from another NT in the string.\n\nWait, the string is t75 t74 t77 t40 t69... etc. So after t75 comes t74.\n\nSo perhaps the structure is S -> NT32 NT32. The first NT32 produces t75, and the second NT32 must produce something that starts with t74. But NT32's only production is t75, so that doesn't go. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nUnless maybe I'm miscounting, perhaps the S produces two NT32s, each of which could produce t75. But that would give us t75 t75, but the string has t75 t74, so that can't be.\n\nWait, that suggests that maybe the initial S isn't producing the first NT32. Maybe it's producing NT30 NT14. Let me see if that makes more sense.\n\nBut NT30's productions are:\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT30 can also produce something else? Looking through, I don't see another production for NT30 except NT3. Wait, let me check the productions.\n\nYes, NT30: NT30 -> NT3 NT30. So it's recursive. So NT30 can produce a string of multiple NT3s. But in the grammar, NT3's production is NT3 -> NT23 NT5. So NT23's production is t34, and NT5's production?\n\nLooking for NT5: I see multiple productions, including NT5->t56.\n\nWait, that suggests that NT5 can also produce t56. So if we have NT30 -> NT3 NT30, which would lead to sequences like NT3 NT3 NT3... until it reaches a terminal. But without another production from NT3 or NT5, except the recursive ones, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT30's other productions aren't in the initial list, but I don't see other options.\n\nWait, looking at the production rules again, I don't see any other immediate productions for NT30 except the recursive one. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial symbols aren't the start. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, maybe the string doesn't start with S. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake because NT30 can only produce a string of NT3s which then produce t34, but that can't get us to t74.\n\nWait, but perhaps NT14 can produce t43, as per some of the rules.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, I don't see NT14 having a terminal production except in S's case.\n\nWait, if S can produce NT30 NT14, then maybe the second part is NT14, which could produce t14 or another NT.\n\nBut looking through the NT14 productions, the only one is NT14 -> t43.\n\nSo if S produces NT30 NT14, then NT14 could produce t43, but in the string, after t75 comes t74, which isn't t43, so that doesn't align.\n\nHmm. That's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe I need to see which production rules can generate those specific terminals step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string must correspond to the parse tree depth. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So for a string of length n, the parse tree must have depth log2(n), but given that the string has 49 symbols, the parse tree would need to be at least 6 levels deep. But perhaps that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work my way backward from each terminal in the string to check if they can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nStarting with the first symbol: t75. As noted, that's from NT32 -> t75. So the first NT32 is handled.\n\nThe second symbol is t74, which comes from NT18 -> t74.\n\nSo in the string, after t75 and t74, we have t77, which comes from NT32 -> t75? Wait no, t77 comes from NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-816","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is always triples of non-terminals. The string is a sequence of symbols, mostly letters like 't' followed by numbers, and some spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar. It's a bit complex, with many non-terminals and production rules. Each line is a production rule, like S -> NT32 NT14. So the start symbol is S, and it produces two non-terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: t75 t78 t43 t34 t78 t40 t21 t15 t68 t15 t65 t77 t1 t46 t84 t69 t1 t26 t28 t78 t69 t43 t26 t78 t1 t43 t70 t26 t1 t68 t69 t74 t68 t32 t69 t26 t26 t69 t74 t65 t78 t52 t69.\n\nI think the first step is to see if there are any non-terminals in the string that don't correspond to terminal symbols. In the grammar, most lines end with a lowercase 't' followed by a number, except some produce symbols like 't71', 't84', etc. So the string seems to consist of terminals, which is good because the grammar only has terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, the productions sometimes produce other non-terminals or sometimes into terminals like 't71', 't35', etc. So perhaps some of the non-terminals produce terminals, while others produce non-terminals.\n\nI need to check the string to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar. Let me list out the tokens in the string to see their order.\n\nLet me note down the string as a list of tokens:\n\nt75, t78, t43, t34, t78, t40, t21, t15, t68, t15, t65, t77, t1, t46, t84, t69, t1, t26, t28, t78, t69, t43, t26, t78, t1, t43, t70, t26, t1, t68, t69, t74, t68, t32, t69, t26, t26, t69, t74, t65, t78, t52, t69.\n\nNow, the grammar starts with S. So the first step is to see what S expands to.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S has two production rules:\n\n1. S -> NT32 NT14\n2. S -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S produces either two non-terminals: NT32 and NT14 or NT18 and NT32.\n\nNow, checking the string, the first token is t75. I'll have to see which production rule could produce t75.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some non-terminals that produce terminals with 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT1 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't75'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n- and others like 't35', 't21', 't43', etc.\n\nSo t75 is produced by NT32 as in the rule NT32 -> 't75' in the list provided. Wait, looking down the list, under NT32's productions, I see:\n\nNT32 -> 't75' as one of the rules. Wait, no, actually, I don't see NT32 being a non-terminal that directly produces 't75' in the provided grammar. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\n...\nNT32 is present as a target in the rules, but do any lines have NT32 -> 't75'? Looking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nYes, here's a line: NT32 -> 't75' (line near the end: NT32 -> 't75'). So NT32 can produce the terminal 't75'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals produce other terminals like 't78', 't43', etc.\n\nSo the first symbol is t75. That matches the production NT32 -> 't75'.\n\nSo the first non-terminal in the string is NT32. Now, the next step is to see what NT32 produces. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT32 is a non-terminal that can produce two non-terminals or maybe a terminal. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT32 has a production rule: NT32 -> 't75', that's a terminal. So S can produce NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. But then, the string starts with t75, which is produced by NT32, so after that, NT14 is the next non-terminal in S's production.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The string starts with t75, which is produced by NT32 (as per NT32 -> 't75'). So S could produce NT32 followed by NT14. So the string after the first t75 would be produced by NT14.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of symbols, but it's in order. So after t75 (which is the first symbol), the next symbol is t78. So, if S produces NT32 NT14, then the next symbol (t78) should be the expansion of NT14. Or if S produces NT18 NT32, then after the first t75 (from NT32), the next symbol should be the expansion of NT18.\n\nBut let's be precise. Let's take each symbol and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to parse the string as if it's the output of the grammar. So, we need to check if the string can be generated step by step, replacing non-terminals with their terminals or other non-terminals as per the rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each step of the grammar replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut given that the string contains 54 symbols, it's too long to parse step by step. Maybe we can look for any rules that produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string and see if they match any productions.\n\nFirst, t75 is produced by NT32. So the first two symbols must correspond to a production that starts with NT32.\n\nLooking at S's production rules:\n\n- S -> NT32 NT14: So the first part would be NT32 (which produces t75) and then NT14. So after t75, the next part should be the expansion of NT14.\n\nWhat can NT14 produce? Looking through the grammar, NT14's production rules include:\n\nNT14 -> NT31 NT21\nNT14 -> 't43'\nND14 -> 't34'\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT14 has the production NT14 -> 't43' and perhaps others, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, looking for NT14's rules:\n\nLine: NT14 -> 't43'\n\nYes, so NT14 can produce 't43' as a terminal. So in the string, after t75, the next symbol is t78, which doesn't match 't43', so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, if S produces S -> NT18 NT32. So t75 would have to come from NT18's production. Wait, does NT18 produce 't75'? Let me check: In the grammar, looking for NT18's production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT18 has a rule NT18 -> 't18', which is different. So if S's production is NT18 NT32, then the first symbols would be the expansion of NT18.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't75', which is produced by NT32. Therefore, S must have produced the production NT32 NT14.\n\nSo, the first symbol is correct as t75 from NT32.\n\nNow, after that, the next part is to see what NT14 produces. Since in the string, the next symbol after t75 is t78, but according to S's first production (NT32 NT14), the next step would be NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, and all productions are either two terminals or two non-terminals. The string provided is a sequence of tokens like 't75', 't69', etc.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string into a sequence of symbols. Each symbol is a 't' followed by a number, like t75, t69, etc. The grammar has a mix of terminals and non-terminals, with some replacements where a non-terminal expands into two terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which expands into NT32 NT14. Then, each NT can expand further, sometimes into other NTs and occasionally directly into a terminal (e.g., NT3 \u2192 't1'). The string starts with 't75', which I notice is a terminal. Let me see which non-terminal expands into 't75'. Looking through the rules, I find NT7 \u2192 't1' and NT3 \u2192 't1'. Also, NT24 \u2192 't72', and NT24 also has a rule NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1. But I'm looking for 't75', which doesn't appear directly; perhaps I missed it. Wait, in the grammar, I see that NT24-> 't72' and NT31-> 't35', etc. Hmm, maybe the token 't75' comes from an NT that I haven't directly defined. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar's production rules, I only see 't75' and others.

Maybe it's from another NT. Looking through the rules again, I don't see any NT that directly becomes 't75'. Did I miss one? Let me scan the production rules again.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT that directly expands into 't75' except perhaps NT1 which becomes 't6', but 't75' isn't an option there. Maybe I was incorrect before; perhaps 't75' comes from an NT. Let me check all the production rules again for NTs and their terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, I notice that NT24\u2192 't72' and there's NT24-> 't17' as well. Also, NT9 \u2192 't49', and NT30\u2192 't26', etc. But I still can't find where 't75' comes from. Maybe I didn't copy the rules correctly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT15, there are two rules: NT15 -> 't35', 't40', etc. Also, NT24-> 't17'. But no, 't75' isn't present anywhere. Hmm, then perhaps the string is invalid because 't75' isn't part of any NT's expansion. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't75' is generated by another NT. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't35' and 't40' (multiple options)\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT0 \u2192 't71', etc.\n- NT24 -> 't72' and other rules\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT35 \u2192 't14'?\nWait, no, NT33\u2192 't35' again. Hmm, I don't see any NT that leads to 't75'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the production rules again. Under the NTs, I don't see any NT that expands into 't75'. Therefore, 't75' isn't part of any NT's expansion rules. It must either be a terminal, but since the grammar might not have a rule that produces 't75', the string is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a production. Let me go through the NTs again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT producing 't75'. The only NT that leads to 't77' is multiple rules: NT11\u2192 't33', etc. But again, 't75' isn't present.\n\nSo, perhaps the string contains a symbol that isn't generated by any production rule in the grammar, making the string unaccepted.\n\nWait, let me think again. The string starts with 't75', but according to the grammar, there's no non-terminal that can generate 't75'.

{"custom_id":"request-835","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with a lot of productions, and the string to check is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like 't75 t40 t69 ...' and so on.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, most productions seem to be in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which fits the B\u2192BC pattern. However, I notice some productions, like 'NT15 -> 't71', which are terminals without non-terminals on the right. That's okay because in CNF, the productions can have terminals on the right as well; it's just that all non-terminals must derive strings of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nMy task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step. The string provided is quite long, so doing this manually would be time-consuming and error-prone. I need a systematic way to approach this.\n\nI remember that for CNF grammars, the parsing can be done using a method called CYK algorithm, but I'm not familiar with how to apply that here. Alternatively, I might try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into smaller parts, using the productions.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of tokens (like 't75', 't40', etc.), I can think of each token as a terminal symbol. The string is a concatenation of these terminals, so each step in the derivation should produce a sequence of terminals that matches parts of this string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol in the string: 't75'. So, in the grammar, which production generates 't75'? Looking through the productions:\n\nI notice that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT15 -> 't71', NT7 -> 't40', etc. Wait, does any non-terminal produce 't75'? Let me scan the productions again.\n\nYes, looking at the last part: 'NT24 -> 't75''. So, NT24 can produce 't75'. That could be our first step. So, the first symbol 't75' must come from NT24.\n\nNow, the initial grammar's start symbol is S. So, S must derive a string that starts with 't75 t40 t69 ...'. Let's see what S can produce. The productions for S are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT14 NT32\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe initial productions:\nS \u2192 NT32 NT32\nS \u2192 NT14 NT32\n\nSo, S is the start symbol, and it can branch into two paths: NT32 NT32 or NT14 NT32.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol in the string is 't75'. How do we get 't75' from S? Because looking at the productions, NT32 can produce certain things. Let's see, in the grammar, NT32 has the following productions:\n\nWait, looking into the provided grammar, I realize that the list is extensive. Let me check NT32's productions.\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\nNT32 -> 't75', yes. So, NT32 can produce 't75'. But wait, S is the start symbol, so how can S produce a terminal directly? Because S's productions are to non-terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT32. So, S is a non-terminal, and to derive a terminal, both NT32 must be able to derive 't75', but let's look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the productions. Let me check NT32's productions carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT4 -> NT25 NT6\n...\nLooking further, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT31 NT2\nNT4 -> NT7 NT32\nNT30 -> NT2 NT22\nNT21 -> NT69 NT26\n...\nWait, perhaps I need to go deeper. Let's think about the structure. Since S is S \u2192 NT32 NT32, S must derive a string that starts with NT32's production and ends with NT32's production.\n\nBut for the first step, S \u2192 NT32 NT32, so the first symbol comes from NT32. If NT32 can produce 't75', then the first part is 't75', but that would require NT32 to be a terminal, which it's not because NT32 is a non-terminal. Hmm, that's conflicting because according to the grammar, NT32 can produce some terminals. For example, wait, in the grammar, I see NT24 \u2192 't75', but I need to check if NT32 can produce 't75'.\n\nWait, looking through the provided productions again, I see that NT23 \u2192 't34' and NT24 \u2192 't75', but not NT32. Let me check if NT32 has any production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nDoes NT32 have any production that results in a terminal? I don't see NT32 -> 't75' in the list. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me re-examine the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for 't75' in NT32's productions: I see NT24 -> 't75', but nothing else.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Since NT32 is a non-terminal, it can only produce sequences of non-terminals, not terminals. Because all productions in CNF (except perhaps the start symbol) don't produce terminals. Or wait, in the given grammar, there are productions that do produce terminals, like NT24 -> 't75', so non-terminals can indeed produce terminals. So, in S's case, S can derive into non-terminals, and those non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't75', so that must come from one of the non-terminals in the derivation chain. Let's think.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT32 NT32, the first symbol must come from the first NT32. If NT32 can produce 't75', then that's a possibility. But wait, looking at NT32's productions, I don't see NT32 \u2192 't75' in the provided list. The only 't75' is produced by NT24 -> 't75'. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing. Let me see: the first symbol is 't75', so 't75' must come from some NT that can produce it. Looking through the list, NT24 is the one that produces 't75'. So perhaps in the derivation, we have to see how S can lead to a string where one of the NTs leads to 't75'.\n\nBut S can only produce to NT32 NT32 or NT14 NT32. Let me check NT14 and NT32.\n\nLooking at NT32, what can it produce? I think I might have missed NT32's production. Let me check again: I see NT4 -> NT7 NT32, NT30 -> NT2 NT22, etc. Wait, perhaps I should create a dependency chart.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can produce a terminal 't75' via some intermediate steps. But given that S is a non-terminal, it must split into two non-terminals, each of which must produce a part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by thinking about the derivation process. Since the string starts with 't75', I need to find a path where the first part is 't75'. Since NT24 is the only NT that produces 't75', perhaps we can think of a way that S can lead to NT24 somewhere in the parse.\n\nBut S's initial productions are to NT32 NT32 or NT14 NT32. So let's check NT32's possible productions. Maybe NT32 can produce a string that includes NT24. Let me look at NT32's productions:\n\nFrom the list, I see NT15 \u2192 't71', NT7 \u2192 't40', etc. Wait, I don't see NT32's production. Perhaps I missed it. Let me scan through each line:\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT32 NT32 and S \u2192 NT14 NT32, the rest are all other NT productions. Let me see:\n\nFor example, NT30 produces NT3 NT30, so it can expand to longer strings. Similarly, NT32's production is not present, so maybe I'm missing something. Or perhaps NT32's production is in another part.\n\nWait, perhaps in the list, NT24 -> 't75"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-851","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a task here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I recall means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side, except for the start symbol. But some of the rules here have empty strings as their right-hand side, which is okay because that just adds epsilon productions.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like `t75 t53 t69 ...` and so on. First off, it looks like each token is a terminal symbol represented by 't' followed by a number. So, each of these is a terminal.\n\nNow, in a context-free grammar, to generate a string, each production must derive a terminal symbol, except at the last step where you might have to deal with epsilon. Since all the tokens here are terminals, the derivation should eventually replace non-terminals with these 'tX' symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit extensive with a lot of NT rules. Each NT rule has two non-terminals on the right side, except some that replace with terminals or maybe even two terminals. Wait, for example, looking at S -> NT32 NT14, which is a start. But the string starts with 't75', which is a terminal. So how can the initial S expansion produce a terminal? Because S is a non-terminal, it must derive into a sequence of terminals. But each S production goes into two non-terminals. So, the entire string should be generated by a series of derivations that eventually produce terminals.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar seems to have productions that produce either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal. For example, NT30 -> NT3 NT30. So, NT30 can produce NT3 followed by itself, which suggests recursion. However, other rules have a terminal. Wait, no, in the production rules, I see some have 't' followed by a number. For example, NT15 -> 't71', which would be a terminal symbol, meaning it's a leaf node in the parse tree, so that's good.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to see if the string can be produced by the grammar. One approach is to model the parse as building a tree where each step replaces non-terminals with their productions, ensuring that all non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals in the string.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, with over 30 non-terminals and many productions, it might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to parse the string.\n\nWait, let's see. The string is a series of 't's with numbers, each being a token separated by spaces. So, the first step is to count the number of tokens. Each 'NT' production in the grammar produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, when we start with S, it becomes two non-terminals, and each of those can produce more non-terminals, leading to a binary tree of productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSince each step in the grammar splits into two, the total length of the string must be a power of two. But looking at the string, let me count the number of tokens. The string is: t75 t53 t69 t74 t78 t80 t15 t77 t26 t68 t68 t15 t77 t26 t15 t1 t69 t74 t69 t74 t77 t63 t77 t69 t46 t71 t69 t74 t77 t69 t77 t3 t71 t3 t1 t77 t63 t65 t1 t25 t77 t1 t26 t25 t69. Let me count each token:\n\n1. t75\n2. t53\n3. t69\n4. t74\n5. t78\n6. t80\n7. t15\n8. t77\n9. t26\n10. t68\n11. t68\n12. t15\n13. t77\n14. t26\n15. t15\n16. t1\n17. t69\n18. t74\n19. t69\n20. t74\n21. t77\n22. t63\n23. t77\n24. t69\n25. t46\n26. t71\n27. t69\n28. t74\n29. t77\n30. t69\n31. t77\n32. t3\n33. t71\n34. t3\n35. t1\n36. t77\n37. t63\n38. t65\n39. t1\n40. t25\n41. t77\n42. t1\n43. t26\n44. t25\n45. t69.\n\nWait, that counts 45 tokens. But each S production leads to an even number of symbols. The initial S is two symbols; each of those can split further. So the total number of symbols must be a power of 2 times something? Wait, Chomsky normal form means each step is two symbols, so the length is a power of two. For example, S (length 1 if it's a terminal, but S is a non-terminal, so each S becomes two symbols in the next step, making length 2. Each of those can become two, making 4, and so on, so the string length must be 2^n.\n\nBut 45 is not a power of two. The closest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So that suggests that it's impossible for this string to be generated by such a grammar. Because the number of symbols must be a power of two, but here we have 45 symbols, which is not a power of two.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily be the case because each production could produce a terminal in one step, allowing for an odd number of non-terminals. For example, in the S -> NT34 NT17 production, which is in the grammar. NT34 -> NT24 NT17, but then if one of them produces a terminal, maybe that could contribute to an odd count. But wait, no, in the production rules, every rule is either two non-terminals or, for some cases, a terminal followed by something else. Wait in the grammar, I see that some rules produce a terminal? Or is the 't' part of another symbol?\n\nLooking closer, in the grammar, some NTs have rules that are 't' followed by a number, but looking at the code, I think the NTs are defined, and some have productions where the right-hand side includes 'tX' as a terminal. For example, NT15 -> 't71'. So, for example, when you have a production like NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal, so that's a way to replace a non-terminal with a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is a non-terminal, and from S, you have S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32. Each of those are two non-terminals. So, any string generated by this grammar must have an even number of symbols because each step only produces an even number of symbols from a non-terminal. Except when a non-terminal produces a terminal, which would add a single symbol. Wait, but no, because every production is either two non-terminals or, for NT15, for example, when it's terminal, how does it work?\n\nWait, no. Wait, in context-free grammars, each production replaces a non-terminal with a sequence of symbols (terminals and non-terminals). So each production is something like A -> \u03b1, where \u03b1 is a sequence of symbols. In the Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol might have epsilon. But in this case, some rules do have terminals, like NT15 -> 't71', which is a terminal production.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user provided some rules where non-terminals produce a terminal. For example, looking at the grammar, some rules like 'NT15 -> t68' etc. But actually, looking back, I think the way the user presented the grammar is mixed, some lines are like S -> ..., others are like NT15 -> 't71'. So, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-852","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check against it. The goal is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. For example, the string starts with `t75 t26 t1 ...` and has 48 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has only two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the terminals, which are single symbols.\n\nTo verify if the string is generated by the grammar, I can reconstruct the parse tree by working from the right side of the string upwards. This is similar to reversing the process of generating the string.\n\nLet's denote the string as S\u2081, S\u2082, ..., S\u2099. Each step involves combining two substrings into a larger substring using a production rule. At each step, we look for a production that matches the current substring and combine the two parts accordingly.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I need to find a production that matches the entire string. Since the grammar's start symbol is S, the entire string should match a production from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial productions from S are:\nS \u2192 NT32 NT14\nS \u2192 NT18 NT32\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string must either be NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. The given string starts with `t75 t26`, which are the terminals derived from NT32 (since NT32 \u2192 't75') and NT14 (NT14 \u2192 't26'). Wait, actually, let's clarify:\n\nWait, the NT32 production might go deeper. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, if S uses NT32 NT14, then NT32 is 't75', and NT14 must be the next part. However, looking at the string, the first two terminals are t75 and t26. If NT32 is t75, then NT14 should be t26. Does NT14 produce t26?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see a production that directly gives 't26'. Instead, I should check if there's a chain that leads to 't26'. Let's see:\n\nLooking into NT32: It's directly 't75'. NT14: Let me check where it appears. It's present in multiple productions like NT24 \u2192 NT4 NT1, NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, etc. Wait, more directly, we have NT14 \u2192 NT31 NT21, and looking further, NT31 \u2192 NT6 NT33, which might lead further down. Alternatively, other NTs might lead to t26.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two terminals are derived from S via S \u2192 NT32 NT14. So, NT32 would be 't75' and NT14 would be 't26'. Wait, but looking for 't26' in the string, which occurs later. So perhaps the string starts with NT32 \u2192 t75 and NT14 \u2192 something else. Hmm, I might be getting confused because the NTs can derive into multiple terminals, not just single ones.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering the string as a sequence of terminals, and each step of combining needs to match a production.\n\nLet me outline the steps I'd take:\n\n1. Start with the entire string: S.\n\n2. Find a production that the entire string can derive from. The first two steps would involve identifying which production rule can generate the entire string by concatenating two parts.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps using a more systematic approach would be better. Let's list out the possible options for the first step.\n\nThe string starts with t75, t26, t1, t1, t15, t25, t15, t15, t26, t69, t74, t80, t3, t42, t71, t77, t1, t26, t15, t65, t77, t78, t43, t78, t1, t78, t80, t1, t77, t26, t1, t68, t42, t43, t69, t52, t26, t26, t69, t74, t77, t69, t22, t69, t69.\n\nThat's 48 tokens, so the parse tree would have 47 internal nodes (since each internal node corresponds to a production rule). Each production uses either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nGiven the grammar, each terminal is derived from a specific non-terminal, as seen in the rules like NT32 \u2192 't75', NT24 \u2192 't79' multiple times, etc.\n\nLet me attempt to split the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the first two symbols are t75 and t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t75 comes from NT32 (from NT32 \u2192 't75'). So, the first non-terminal is NT32, which produces t75.\n\nThen, the second symbol is t26, which could be from NT14. Let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, do we have a production for NT14 that leads to t26? Scanning the rules for NT14, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, it's not directly a terminal. For example, NT32 \u2192 t75, which is one terminal. Other non-terminals produce more non-terminals, and some of them eventually produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t26 comes from a deeper production. For example, NT26 might produce t26.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a NT26. Instead, looking for non-terminals that end with 't26' in their productions, it seems that NT24 appears in multiple places as NT24 leading to t79 or t74, etc. Alternatively, let's look for where 't26' is produced.\n\nLooking into NT71 (from the production NT023 \u2192 t71) but that doesn't help. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can only find specific instances where a non-terminal is directly assigned to a terminal. It seems that NT26 isn't directly assigned, so perhaps the string uses another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the first two tokens are from NT32 and NT14. Let me check S's productions again:\n\nS can be NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, the entire string must be either NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the entire string is the concatenation of NT32 and NT14, or of NT18 and NT32.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is produced by a process starting with S, which branches into NT32 NT14, each of which may branch further.\n\nSince the string starts with t75, t26, t1,...\n\nLooking up NT32 in the grammar: NT32 can only immediately produce t75. So NT32 \u2192 t75. Therefore, the first symbol must be t75, which it is.\n\nThen, after t75, we have t26, which would come from NT14. But in NT14's rules, NT14 produces more non-terminals, not terminals. So, the next step is: after t75, we have t26, which is the second part of the S production NT32 NT14. So, the second element after t75 should be the entire remainder of the string.\n\nSo, the remainder after t75 and t26 would be t1, t1, t15, t25, t15, t15, t26, t69, t74, t80, t3, t42, t71, t77, t1, t26, t15, t65, t77, t78, t43, t78, t1, t78, t80, t1, t77, t26, t1, t68, t42, t43, c69, t52, t26, t26, t69, t74, t77, t69, t22, t69, t69.\n\nIf the first production is S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then after NT32 (t75), it must be NT14, which produces t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of terminals, each separated by a space. \n\nI also see that some of the productions directly map to terminals, such as NT3 -> 't75', NT19 -> 't1', etc. So, each 't' followed by a number in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. \n\nMy approach will be to parse the string backward, as a top-down parser in CNF can more easily handle leftmost derivations. Starting from the start symbol S, I'll see if the entire string can be generated by applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe string has 69 elements. Let's list them numerically to identify each 't' and its position:\n1. t75\n2. t49\n3. t78\n4. t69\n5. t40\n6. t78\n7. t1\n8. t1\n9. t69\n10. t34\n11. t15\n12. t15\n13. t77\n14. t1\n15. t1\n16. t46\n17. t71\n18. t71\n19. t26\n20. t15\n21. t78\n22. t43\n23. t26\n24. t26\n25. t15\n26. t78\n27. t40\n28. t1\n29. t69\n30. t74\n31. t1\n32. t65\n33. t84\n34. t68\n35. t84\n36. t77\n37. t69\n38. t19\n39. t46\n40. t19\n41. t46\n42. t19\n43. t1\n44. t68\n45. t68\n46. t69\n\nStarting with S, according to the grammar, S can be produced in two ways: S-> NT32 NT14 or S-> NT18 NT32. I'll need to choose which production to follow. Since the string starts with t75, which is a terminal, I should look at the productions that produce t75.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT3 -> 't1', NT19 -> 't1', NT7 -> 't40', etc. But I don't see an NT that directly produces t75. Wait a minute, maybe I missed that. Let me check again. Oh, looking at the productions:\n\nWait, I see that NT30 -> 't63', which is t63, but I don't see a production for NT32 directly mapping to 't75'. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe I should check the start symbol's productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is in two productions: S-> NT32 NT14 and S-> NT18 NT32. But 't75' would have to come from one of these non-terminals. Let me check if NT32 or NT14 can produce 't75'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT32 -> 't75', because in the productions, I see \"NT32 -> 't75'\". So S can be NT32, and then followed by NT14. So S can start with NT32, which produces t75, then NT14.\n\nNow, the next terminal after t75 is t49. So let's see what NT14 can produce. Looking through the productions, N T14 has multiple productions, but none directly listed except from earlier in the list. Wait, I should look through the provided productions to see if any NT14 production can yield t49.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT7 -> 't40' and NT23 -> 't46'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused because in the provided grammar, the NT14 is written as NT14 -> 't43'. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the productions, line by line, under NT14: \"NT14 -> 't43'\". Yes, so NT14 directly produces 't43'.\n\nWait, but the next symbol after t75 is t49. So in S's first production, S-> NT32 NT14, so after NT32 (which is t75), NT14 produces t43. But here, the next terminal is t49, which is after t75. That suggests that the first step is S -> NT32 NT14, producing t75 followed by t43. But the string has t49 as the second symbol, which is t75, then t49. That's a problem because the next symbol would be t43, not t49.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps the first production I should consider is S-> NT32 NT14, but in the string, the first two symbols are t75 and t49. But according to production S-> NT32 NT14, the first terminal would be t75 (from NT32), then the next symbol would be t43 (from NT14), not t49. Therefore, that doesn't match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake, and the S's other production is S-> NT18 NT32. Let's check that. NT18 is another non-terminal. Do we have any production for NT18 that yields t49?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see NT18 producing t49. Let me scan through the NT18 entries:\n\n- NT18 -> NT25 NT10\n- NT18 -> NT32 NT27\n- NT18 -> NT17 NT30\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see several lines where NT18 is on the left:\n\n- NT23-> 't19', etc. Wait, perhaps I should find a production for NT18 that yields t49.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a path where S can produce t75 (via S-> NT32 NT14, but as above, the next terminal would be t43, not t49). Alternatively, perhaps the string starts differently. Let me look again at the string:\n\nThe string starts with t75 t49 t78 t69... So the first two symbols are t75 then t49.\n\nIf S is producing t75 followed by t49, then perhaps the production is S-> NT32 NT14 and NT14 produces t49 somehow. But I don't see that in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check if there's any NT14 production that produces t49. Looking through the productions, I don't see that. The only production for NT14 is -> 't43'. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approach. Perhaps the first two symbols are t75 and t49, which would require the first production to be NT32 (t75) and the next NT18. But then NT18 must produce t49. Do any NT18 productions end with t49? Looking through the list:\n\n- I don't see any NT18 directly producing t49 in the productions.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach might not be correct. Maybe I should parse the string in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the string is not generated by this grammar, but I should check for possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with multiple non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-877","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by looking at the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is good because it means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. CNF is useful for parsing algorithms, but since I'm just trying to determine if a string is generated by the grammar, I might not need to parse the entire string.\n\nThe given string is: `t75 t69 t3 t80 t69 t74 t26 t78 t69 t74 t78 t35 t69 t21 t15 t15 t65 t69 t19 t78 t74 t77 t40 t46 t32 t69 t74 t77 t69 t84 t35 t69 t19 t78 t80 t15 t3 t1 t3 t42 t70 t74 t69 t34 t1 t69`.\n\nI notice that this string contains many 't' followed by numbers, like 't75', 't74', etc. Looking at the grammar, I should check if these 't' elements are terminals or if they're part of non-terminals.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So all a's are terminals. Therefore, the 't75', 't69', etc., are terminals, right? So each of these must be produced directly by a production rule, or they must be part of the string as they are in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I need to see if each 't' symbol corresponds to a production rule that starts with that terminal. So, for example, if there's a rule like 'S \u2192 t75' or something similar, then 't75' could appear in the string generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let's look through the grammar rules. Scanning through all the production rules, I see a bunch of NT... \u2192 other non-terminals. Some have terminals, like 't71', 't72', etc. For instance, I see:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'\n- NT31 \u2192 't69'\n- NT24 \u2192 't72'\n- And so on.\n\nSo, each of these is a production where a non-terminal produces a single terminal symbol. So, for example, 't75' is produced by some NT if it's in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I see:\n\nS can produce NT32 NT32, which is a combination of non-terminals, but when those non-terminals generate terminals, their combination would form the string.\n\nSo, the approach is to check each 't' in the string and see if it's allowed by the grammar. Also, to ensure that the overall structure of the string can be derived from S using the given rules.\n\nWait, let's break down the string:\n\nThe string is a sequence of terms like t75, t69, t3, etc., each separated by spaces. So the entire string is a concatenation of these terminals.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so for the string to be generated, each of these 'tX' must appear as a terminal somewhere in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, let's compile a list of all the terminals:\n\n- t1 (appears in rules like NT30 \u2192 NT18 NT32, etc.)\n- t3\n- t7\n- t14\n- t18\n- t2\n- t24\n- t32 (from NT32 in the S rule)\n- t74\n- t26\n- t35\n- t69\n- t28\n- t80\n- t53 (from NT1)\n- t3 (from NT7 \u2192 't40'?

Now, looking at the string, all the terms are among these, except let me check if all are there.\n\nLooking at the string: t75 t69 t3 t80 t69 t74 t26 t78 t69 t74 t78 t35 t69 t21 t15 t15 t65 t69 t19 t78 t74 t77 t40 t46 t32 t69 t74 t77 t69 t84 t35 t69 t19 t78 t80 t15 t3 t1 t3 t42 t70 t74 t69 t34 t1 t69.\n\nWait, I'm seeing t75. Is there a production for a non-terminal that produces t75? Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, do any produce t75?\n\nLooking through the 50+ production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t75. The S rule is S\u2192NT32 NT32, which is two non-terminals and would produce two terminals when fully expanded.\n\nBut in our string, we have a t75 as the second element. So unless there's a production that allows t75 to be generated from somewhere, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar rules, is there any NT that directly produces t75? Let me go through each:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 t34\n- NT31 \u2192 t69\n- NT24 \u2192 t72\n- NT30 \u2192 t32\n- NT27 \u2192 t77\n- And so on.\n\nI don't see any rule that ends with NT producing t75. So that suggests that t75 is not a terminal that the grammar ever defines. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that isn't in the grammar's terminals.\n\nWait, but I should make sure that I'm not missing any. Let me look through the entire list again quickly.\n\nNo, from the list, t75 is not present as a terminal generated by any rule.

{"custom_id":"request-894","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making it easier to analyze, especially for something like the CYK algorithm. But wait, I'm not sure if I remember the CYK algorithm perfectly, but the main idea is that it's a dynamic programming method to parse strings in CNF.\n\nFirst, let me recap the grammar. It has several production rules, all of which are binary (A -> BC), so each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Some of the non-terminals are terminals, as indicated by the rule endings, but wait no\u2014looking closer, the grammar has several rules like S -> NT32 NT14, which are non-terminals, but then some like NT32 -> 't75', which are terminals. So, the grammar includes both non-terminals and terminals. \n\nThe string we have is a sequence of terminal symbols. So, the task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me list the string: t75 t26 t15 t69 t26 t1 t77 t26 t77 t69 t1 t77 t1 t49 t1 t69 t74 t42 t19 t74 t3 t22 t69 t19 t69 t74 t3 t15 t77 t26 t3 t42 t19 t77 t69 t42 t71 t40 t46 t21 t74 t78 t80 t78 t69 t69 t69.\n\nThat's a lot of symbols, but each of them is a terminal. So, the strategy is to see if these terminals can be generated by the non-terminals expanding into them through the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the right-hand sides of the production rules are combinations of non-terminals. The key is to construct a derivation where the string can be built up step by step using these rules.\n\nSince this is going to be complex, perhaps I should look for patterns or known symbols that might help. Alternatively, I can look for which non-terminals produce each terminal in the string and see if there's a way to connect them.\n\nLet me take the string step by step and see if I can match it to the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol 't75'. Looking at the grammar, which rule produces 't75'? Scanning through the rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't1'\nNT7 -> 't1'\nNT25 -> 't64' (Wait, no, 't64' is not in the string. Let me recheck. Maybe I missed a rule. Looking again, under NT34: NT34 -> 't12' or NT34 't24'? Wait, let me look back.\n\nWait, here's a part:\n\nNT34 -> NT12 NT1\nNT34 -> NT1 NT1\nHmm, perhaps I should look for where 't75' appears. Checking the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't28', but 't75' is somewhere else. Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT32:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75' is not directly a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, the lines are:\n\nWait, let me list out some crucial rules:\n\nNT32 -> 't75' appears as a terminal in the string. So, looking at the grammar, is there a rule where NT32 produces 't75'? Yes, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT32 -> 't75' is a rule? Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT32, in the rules, yes, the line says:\n\nNT32 -> 't75'\n\nWait, the grammar has:\nNT32 -> 't75' \u2014 wait no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nWait, the lines are:\n\nNT32 appears, but perhaps it's an intermediate step. Wait, looking again:\n\nWait, I see lines like:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo S can become two NTs. Then NT32 seems to be another non-terminal that may produce other things.\n\nWait, actually, I'm noticing that NT32 is being used in the S's production, and in other rules, like:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\nNT32 -> 't75' \u2014 is that a rule? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking through the rules:\n\nI see NT32 -> 't75' as a production. So:\n\n\"NT32\" \u2192 \"t75\"\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is 't75', which would imply that the NT32 non-terminal must be used to produce it. So, in the derivation, S must have a path to NT32, which can then expand to 't75'.\n\nSo, the first step is: S \u2192 NT32 NT14, as S has two options, and we pick the one that starts with NT32.\n\nThen, the string starts with 't75', so the first two symbols (if NT32 is used) would be 't75' followed by 't26', but wait, no\u2014the string is 't75', then 't26', etc. Since S \u2192 NT32 NT14, the string would be the concatenation of NT32's expansion followed by NT14's expansion.\n\nBut wait, no. The string is a single sequence, so S expands to NT32 NT14, and then each of those non-terminals expands further. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT32 and NT14.\n\nWait a minute, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the approach.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar has production rules, so to parse the string, I need to see if the entire string can be generated by starting from S and expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, the process involves breaking down the string into parts that match the possible expansions of the non-terminals, recursively.\n\nGiven that this is a CNF grammar, each step will involve splitting the current substring into two parts, each corresponding to the left and right parts of a production rule.\n\nSo, for example, if I have a production A \u2192 BC, and the current substring is [B][C], I can use A to generate it.\n\nTherefore, a possible approach is to use dynamic programming, defining a table dp[i][j] indicating whether the substring from position i to j can be generated by a particular non-terminal. But since I need to check manually, perhaps I can find a way to break the string into smaller parts that match the grammar.\n\nBut given the length of the string, this might take a while. Let me try to look for patterns or specific symbols that might indicate a certain production.\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt75 t26 t15 t69 t26 t1 t77 t26 t77 t69 t1 t77 t1 t49 t1 t69 t74 t42 t19 t74 t3 t22 t69 t19 t69 t74 t3 t15 t77 t26 t3 t42 t19 t77 t69 t42 t71 t40 t46 t21 t74 t78 t80 t78 t69 t69 t69\n\nSo, let's list the symbols as a list for easier reference:\n\n['t75', 't26', 't15', 't69', 't26', 't1', 't77', 't26', 't77', 't69', 't1', 't77', 't1', 't49', 't1', 't69', 't74', 't42', 't19', 't74', 't3', 't22', 't69', 't19', 't69', 't74', 't3', 't15', 't77', 't26', 't3', 't42', 't19', 't77', 't69', 't42', 't71', 't40', 't46', 't21', 't74', 't78', 't80', 't78', 't69', 't69', 't69']\n\nLooking for the beginning: 't75' is a terminal, so it must come from a non-terminal that has a production ending with 't75'. Looking through the rules, the only rule that directly produces 't75' is NT32 \u2192 't75'. So, the first symbol 't75'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-895","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I have a context-free grammar given in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string is: `t75 t69 t69 t69 t34 t80 t74 t77 t78 t40 t1 t77 t80 t3 t42 t71 t69 t17 t74 t3 t77 t69 t77 t69 t69 t74 t15 t1 t1 t63 t40 t26 t15 t69 t26 t78 t43 t59 t46 t69 t26 t3 t77 t69 t34 t74 t69`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see non-terminals on the left and terminals on the right side of the arrows, some with two non-terminals and others with a single terminal. So, the right-hand sides can be terminals or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it according to the grammar rules. Alternatively, since the grammar seems a bit complex, maybe I can find patterns or the parse tree that generates the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t75, t69, etc. The terminal symbols here are like 'tX', where X is a number. Each terminal appears to be a single character, but wait, no, it's 't' followed by a number. Wait, in the grammar, the terminals are things like 't71', which is a single terminal symbol 't71'. So each of these 'tX' is a single terminal symbol. Therefore, each token in the string is a terminal symbol, which is a single character.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminal symbols:\n\nt75, t69, t69, t69, t34, t80, t74, t77, t78, t40, t1, t77, t80, t3, t42, t71, t69, t17, t74, t3, t77, t69, t77, t69, t69, t74, t15, t1, t1, t63, t40, t26, t15, t69, t26, t78, t43, t59, t46, t69, t26, t3, t77, t69, t34, t74, t69.\n\nSo, each of these are individual terminals, meaning that in the parse tree, each node must eventually resolve to these terminals or non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some of them produce two terminals. For example, S -> NT32 NT14, which would produce t32 and t14 when expanded. Similarly, NT30 could produce a non-terminal, like NT30 -> NT3 NT30, which is a recursive rule that may keep expanding until a terminal is produced.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar rules. But doing this manually for such a long string would be time-consuming. Maybe I can break it down segment by segment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find subparts of the string that match certain rules.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t75, t69, t69, t69, t34, t80, t74, t77, t78, t40, t1, t77, t80, t3, t42, t71, t69, t17, t74, t3, t77, t69, t77, t69, t69, t74, t15, t1, t1, t63, t40, t26, t15, t69, t26, t78, t43, t59, t46, t69, t26, t3, t77, t69, t34, t74, t69.\n\nWait a second, that's 40 tokens. Each is a single terminal. Let's think about the possible rules that can produce these.\n\nStarting from S, which can be split into two parts: S -> NT32 NT14 or S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nLet me consider both options.\n\nOption 1: S expands to NT32 and NT14.\n\nNT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nNT22 has productions: NT22 -> NT8 NT0 and NT22 -> NT21 NT18.\n\nWait, NT32: Let's see.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nSo, NT32 expands to NT2 and NT22. So, the first token in the string is t75, which must be generated by NT32 or some downstream non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT32's productions:\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string would be t75, t69. Wait, no:\n\nWait, if NT32 generates two symbols, which are the next two in the string, then the first symbol after S expansion would be NT32, which becomes t75 (if it produces a terminal) or another non-terminal. Wait, but looking at NT32's rules: NT32 only expands into NT2 and NT22, which are non-terminals. So, S -> NT32 NT14 would expand into NT2 NT22 NT14. But without a rule that NT2 produces a terminal, this could be problematic because NT2 can produce NT22 NT15 or NT24 NT17, wait, no: Let me check NT2's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> NT22 NT15 or NT24 NT17.\n\nWait, both involve non-terminals. So, if S is NT32 NT14, then we have NT32 (NT2 NT22) and NT14.\n\nBut NT14's production is NT31 NT21. So S becomes NT2 NT22 NT31 NT21.\n\nHmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps S is expanding into NT18 and NT32. Let's explore that.\n\nS -> NT18 NT32.\n\nNT18's production: Looking at the grammar, NT18 -> NT23 NT5.\n\nNT32 -> NT2 NT22.\n\nSo, S would expand into NT23 NT5 NT2 NT22.\n\nBut again, NT23, NT5, and NT22 have their own expansions, which might involve more non-terminals. This seems unwieldy.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to look for the string and see if each part is covered by the terminal symbols that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar has a lot of terminals. For example, in the given grammar, several non-terminals have productions that result in single terminals. For example:\n\nNT15 -> 't71'\n\nNT15 -> 't35'\n\nNT15 -> 't68'\n\nWait, so NT15 can produce these terminals. Similarly, NT13 -> 't28' or 't78', and so on.\n\nThis suggests that some non-terminals can be expanded into specific terminal symbols.\n\nNow, looking at the string: the first few tokens are t75, t69, t69, t69, t34, etc.\n\nLooking for 't75', in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't75'. So perhaps 't75' is a terminal symbol that appears as a result of expansion, but unless there's a rule that a non-terminal can produce 't75', it's hard to see.\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there a rule that produces 't75'? Let's check the left-hand sides. The right-hand sides of the rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nI see many rules like NT24 -> NT12 NT1, which are non-terminals. But I'm trying to find a rule where a non-terminal expands into a single terminal like 't75'.\n\nLooking through all the right-hand sides, I notice there's a rule NT4 -> 't56', NT7 -> 't40', etc., but does any non-terminal produce 't75'? Hmm.\n\nLooking again, I think there's a rule NT5 -> 't68"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-917","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty long with all these production rules, and the string is a sequence of symbols starting with 't75' and ending with a bunch of 't' symbols. Hmm, this looks a bit intimidating, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar. It seems like most of the non-terminals (like NT1, NT2, etc.) are defined in terms of other non-terminals, and some of them are directly mapped to 't's. Each production rule is of the form A -> BC, which is typical for Chomsky Normal Form. That means each step in the derivation only expands one non-terminal into two others. \n\nThe given string is quite long and consists entirely of 't' symbols with various indices like t75, t49, t43, etc. My initial thought is to parse this string as if it's a derivation sequence in the grammar. The leftmost symbol should expand according to the grammar, and each subsequent symbol should be part of the expanded structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. S has two production rules: S -> NT32 NT14 and S -> NT18 NT32. So, the first expansion from S will decide whether it's NT32 followed by NT14 or NT18 followed by NT32. Let's see what those mean.\n\nIf S expands to NT32 NT14, then we need to see what NT32 and NT14 can produce. NT32 has production rules leading to 't75' (from NT32 -> t75 in the rules) and possibly other non-terminals. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT32 -> 't75' one time. Wait, no, actually, checking the rules, I see:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that for example NT32 -> 't75', but actually, it's in the list here: NT32 is a non-terminal, and looking through the rules, I see lines like NT15 -> 't71', NT23 -> 't21', etc. Wait, but I'm getting confused because the user included a lot of production rules, some direct to 't's.\n\nWait, for example, I see NT32 -> 't75', which would mean that NT32 can directly produce the terminal 't75'. Similarly, looking at the other NT rules, some non-terminals directly produce 't's with numbers. So, it's possible that the string is composed of these 't's, each corresponding to a production step.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead. Let's see the string: t75 t49 t43 t59 t78 t26 t15 t43 t69 t59 t1 t77 t26 t78 t80 t1 t69 t74 t15 t68 t68 t15 t3 t46 t71 t1 t1 t25 t25 t68 t15 t77 t1 t49 t46 t43 t1 t68 t77 t63 t1 t63 t69 t26 t68 t69 t26 t69.\n\nThat's 46 symbols long. Each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Now, considering that the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, when you have a non-terminal that can only produce terminals (i.e., zero non-terminals in the right-hand side), it represents a leaf node in the parse tree. \n\nSo, perhaps the string is a sequence of productions where each step is a terminal or a non-terminal. If the string is a derivation sequence starting from S, each symbol represents the leftmost expansion. Wait, but with the start symbol S expanding into two non-terminals, followed by each of those expanding further until terminals are reached.\n\nBut considering that the string starts with 't75', which is a terminal, that would have to come from a non-terminal that directly produces that 't'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT15 -> 't71', NT31 -> 't77', NT23 -> 't77' etc. Wait, but does any non-terminal directly produce 't75'?\n\nWait, looking back: No, I think I saw that NT32 is a non-terminal, and in the rules, I see \"NT32 -> 't75'\", so yes, NT32 can produce 't75'. Similarly, NT23 -> 't77', NT24 -> 't79', etc. So each time a non-terminal directly expands to a 't' symbol.\n\nBut the string starts with t75, then t49. Let's think: the first symbol in the string is t75, which comes from NT32 perhaps. The next symbol is t49. Wait, but in a leftmost derivation, starting from S, which can expand into NT32 NT14 or NT18 NT32. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Starting with S -> NT32 NT14. Then the derivation starts with NT32 and NT14. Next, each of these would expand. But the string starts with t75, which would be the first symbol, so t75 comes from NT32 expanding to 't75', which is possible if that's the production.\n\nThen the next symbol is t49. That would have to come from the next symbol in the sequence, which is the NT14 expansion. Wait, but NT14 isn't an explicit non-terminal in the given rules. Wait, looking back, I think there's an issue here. Wait, in the user's provided grammar, do they have a NT14, or are they using something else?\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT14 isn't listed as a non-terminal with a production. Instead, I notice that NT17 and others have productions, but maybe the string's symbols correspond to NTs elsewhere. Wait, perhaps each 't' in the string is the result of a fully expanded non-terminal. So the string is a concatenation of the terminals generated by a leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by leftmost derivations starting from S. But that could take a while because the string is long. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the leftmost symbols in the string and see if they correspond to expansions in the grammar.\n\nBut considering the grammar, the non-terminals that produce terminals are:\n\nFrom the rules:\n- NT15: 't71', 't19', 't28', 't68', 't77', 't82' etc.\n- NT19: 't68', 't35', 't21', etc.\n- NT23: 't3', 't25', 't77', etc.\n- NT24: 't17', 't21', 't24', 't27', 't42', 't43', etc.\n- NT25: 't22', 't53', etc.\n- NT28: 't30', 't52', etc.\n- NT30: 't26', etc.\n- NT32: 't75'\n- NT1: 't6'\n- Various others.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal in one of the non-terminals' productions. So, each symbol in the string is the result of a non-terminal expanding to a single 't' followed by other symbols.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the grammar has any non-terminals that produce two non-terminals followed by a terminal. For instance, do some non-terminals expand into a 't' and another non-terminal? Wait, in a leftmost derivation, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until you can't expand anymore, leaving only terminals.\n\nWait, but in our grammar, all the production rules for non-terminals (NT) are of the form NT -> NT NT. So, each production rule for NTs only produces non-terminals. Therefore, every symbol in the string must be the result of a series of expansions where each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until a non-terminal that directly produces a terminal is reached.\n\nSo, for example, to get 't75' at the beginning of the string, we must have a non-terminal that directly produces 't75'. Looking at the rules, yes, NT32 -> 't75', so NT32 can produce 't75'. Then, the next symbol in the string is 't49'. That would have to come from the next non-terminal in the expansion. Let's say the initial S expands into NT32 NT14, so the first expansion is NT32 and NT14. NT32 becomes 't75', but then the next symbol in the string is 't4"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-919","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string provided is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is quite complex. Each production rule is in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except the terminals. This is consistent with Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Here, the terminals are strings like 't75', 't43', etc., so each terminal is a single character. My string to check is a sequence of these terminals. \n\nThe string is: \nt75 t43 t34 t46 t43 t26 t78 t1 t19 t1 t15 t77 t80 t69 t74 t77 t26 t15 t40 t46 t71 t3 t77 t46 t43 t71 t69 t74 t26 t78 t40 t74 t1 t46 t34 t74 t46 t71 t77 t69 t43 t77 t63 t65 t68 t69 t69.\n\nI notice that the grammar has a limited number of terminals, and each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal. The string is 64 characters long, all terminals. So, each step in the derivation would create a string of terminals, and eventually, the start symbol S must derive this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit overwhelming, but I think I can approach this by trying to match the string backward, using reduction techniques. Since the grammar is CNF, I can look for the rightmost symbols and see if they can be produced by any non-terminal. But sometimes, the rightmost non-terminal could only produce a single terminal, so each step in the reduction would collapse two symbols into one.\n\nLet me outline the steps I can take:\n\n1. **Identify the start symbol and the string to check.**\n   The start symbol is S, and the target string is the given sequence.\n\n2. **Check if the string can be divided into parts that match the productions.**\n   Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two parts, the entire string must be split into pairs or matched against the possible rules.\n\n3. **Consider the possible rules that can produce the terminals in the string.**\n   For example, if a rule produces 't75', I can check if any non-terminal has 't75' in its productions. Similarly for other terminals.\n\n4. **Attempt to reduce the string from right to left, matching each pair of symbols to a non-terminal's production.**\n\nStarting with the rightmost symbol 't69', I need to find a non-terminal that can produce 't69'. Looking at the grammar, NT31 can produce 't69' (from NT31 -> 't69'). So, the last symbol is produced by NT31.\n\nSo, the current reduction would be: ... -> ... -> NT31 -> 't69'\n\nNow, the remaining string is everything except the last symbol. Next, I need to see if the next two symbols (last two before 't69') can be matched by a production of NT31.\n\nWait, in reduction, each step reduces two symbols into one. So, I need to check if the pair of the last two symbols is part of a production. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up expansion and reduction. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, in reduction, I have a current non-terminal, and I can split the string into parts that correspond to the productions of that non-terminal. So starting from the beginning, I can split the string into two parts that match any production A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is built from the start, I can try to build it step by step, checking each position.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to start from the end. Let's see:\n\nThe last symbol is 't69'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals have 't69' as a terminal? Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT21 -> 't69' (Yes, NT21 can produce 't69').\n- NT77 -> 't69' (Yes, from earlier rules, NT29 -> NT28 NT15, but I don't see NT29 directly producing 't69'. Wait, NT29 -> 't28' and 't62'? Or wait, looking back, the grammar has:\n\nFrom the grammar, some key terminals:\nNT21 -> 't69' and NT77 can produce 't69', but wait, let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the provided rules for terminals:\n\nLooking for 't69' in the terminal productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT24 -> 't77' (from multiple rules)\n- NT31 -> 't69'\n- NT28 -> 't71' (a 't71' is present)\nWait, no. Let's go through the provided rules carefully.\n\nLet me scan through all the provided rules to find which non-terminals produce 't69':\n\nLooking for 't69':\n\n- NT7 -> 't1'\n- NT24 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT28 -> 't82'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT12 -> 't78'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't49'\n- NT17 -> 't68'\n- NT13 -> 't28'\n- NT2 -> 't49'\n- NT30 -> 't26'\n- NT21 -> 't69'\n- NT17 -> 't82'\n- NT10 -> 't42'\n- NT18 -> 't74'\n- NT23 -> 't19'\n- NT22 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't1'\n- NT7 -> 't40'\n- NT24 -> 't12'\n- NT24 -> 't42'\n- NT30 -> 't63'\n- NT27 -> 't77'\n- NT17 -> 't65'\n- NT33 -> 't52'\n- NT29 -> 't62'\n- NT25 -> 't64'\n- NT24 -> 't17'\n- NT17 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't46'\n- NT0 -> 't32'\n- NT24 -> 't79'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT19 -> 't15'\n- NT23 -> 't70'\n- NT31 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't53'\n- NT1 -> 't6'\n- NT0 -> 't84'\n- NT13 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't80'\n- NT4 -> 't56'\n\nWait, I see that NT21 -> 't69', right? Because in the provided rules, NT21 is defined as NT21 -> 't69'. So the last symbol 't69' could be produced by NT21.\n\nNow, the previous symbol before 't69' is 't77'. So the pair is 't77 t69'. We need to find a production where the right-hand side is 't77 NT21' or 'NT21' followed by 't69', but since the grammar is in CNF, it's either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 produces 't69' directly. So, if in the production, NT21 is replaced by 't69', then the part before 't69' must have been produced by that NT21. But in the context of reduction, if we are at the end, the last symbol must be matched by a terminal, which it is. The part before that must have been produced by the same non-terminal, but that non-terminal, in this case, NT21, but NT21 cannot produce 't77' as the next symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should be thinking differently. In reduction, the process is: we have a string that ends with 't69', which could be produced by NT21. So, the last symbol is from NT21, so the part before NT21 must have been a production that includes NT21 as the rightmost symbol. But NT21 only produces 't69'; it doesn't produce anything else. So the part before 't69' is 't77', which would have to come from NT21, but that can't be because NT21 can't produce 't77'; only 't69'. So this suggests that 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-932","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure this out. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by the grammar. The grammar is pretty complex with many non-terminals and terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers, but I need to see if it can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. However, looking at the string, I notice that the last part ends with 't74 t74 t74 t78 t74 t78 t40'. There are several 't74's, which might correspond to the terminal 't74' in the grammar.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for the string, each token should be either an intermediate non-terminal (like S, NT30, etc.) or a terminal symbol. But in the grammar provided, each production is a non-terminal pointing to exactly two other non-terminals except for those that directly have terminals. For example, looking at the start symbol S, it can produce NT32 NT14, which are non-terminals. But wait, some of the productions have 't' followed by numbers, like 't75'. Hmm, I think those are terminal symbols.\n\nWait, no\u2014Chomsky normal form doesn't directly include terminal symbols on the left side. The left side is always a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals. So, perhaps the grammar has been simplified, or perhaps the given grammar has a mix where some non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, looking again, some productions have terminals like 't74', so these are terminal symbols that appear on the right side of the productions. For example, S \u2192 NT32 NT32 is a production, but others have 't's. So, the non-terminals can eventually derive into a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut the string given is all terminals, right? The string is a sequence of 't's and numbers, so we can parse it as a sequence of terminals.\n\nNow, to determine if the given string is in the language, perhaps I can use CYK parsing or check through the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down using the productions.\n\nLet's look at the string: `t75 t26 t1 t68 t68 t42 t32 t69 t78 t43 t78 t80 t78 t1 t1 t68 t77 t69 t77 t26 t15 t77 t69 t68 t42 t84 t22 t69 t34 t3 t78 t43 t59 t74 t74 t77 t74 t78 t3 t80 t78 t40 t1 t77 t69 t42 t19 t74 t69`\n\nThat's a long string, but perhaps if I can find a way to trace it back through the grammar.\n\nStart with the entire string; see if it can be generated from S. Since S can derive into two non-terminals, each of which then must produce parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial part of the string can lead us through.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which has two options: S \u2192 NT32 NT32 (but in the grammar, S's productions are S->NT32 NT14 and S->NT18 NT32, so maybe I misread earlier).

{"custom_id":"request-937","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether this given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form (CNF), which helps because each production rule is exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t75 t53 t69 t74 t40 t78 t74 t77 t46 t71 t1 t80 t43 t34 t3 t40 t26 t1 t15 t68 t65 t46 t19 t1 t25 t71 t3 t77 t1 t1 t26 t78 t43 t26 t26 t78 t40 t74 t77 t69 t71 t42 t43 t69 t34 t1 t42 t19 t69`.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules. The initial symbol is S, and the first few productions are:\n\nS -> NT32 NT14\nS -> NT18 NT32\n\nSo, S can produce pairs of non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals seems to have their own production rules. Looking through the rules, I notice that some non-terminals can produce terminal strings (indicated by those with arrows ending in 't*').\n\nFor example, NT15 has several productions that result in 't71', 't35', 't21', 't82', 't40', 't68', 't1', 't59', etc. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT17, NT23, NT0 can produce various terminals like 't1', 't71', etc. \n\nThe given string is quite long, with 40 tokens. Each token must correspond to a terminal. I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence step by step.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the first few tokens: t75, t53, t69, t74, t40.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t75 is produced by NT32, as NT32 -> t75 (from the rules). NT32 is an NT, so I need to see how it's structured.\n\nWait, looking back, NT32 is a production for S: S -> NT32 NT14. So, perhaps the string starts with NT32 producing t75, followed by NT14.\n\nNT14's production includes t74, because looking at the rules: NT14 -> t74. So the first part of the string would be t75 and t74.\n\nNext, the third token is t69. Let's see how t69 is produced. Looking through the rules, NT6 -> t53, but t69 isn't a terminal here. Wait, let me check: in the rules, NT15 -> t69 (Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see NT15 producing t69. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I see that NT31 -> t69, and that's one of the rules. So NT31 can produce t69. So how does NT30 produce t69? Let's see: NT30 -> NT2 NT22. Then, I need to check how NT2 and NT22 can produce the next tokens.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a recursive descent or another method to parse the string. But given the time, I should perhaps look for a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me consider that each non-terminal can produce a certain sequence of terminals, so perhaps I can map out possible derivations.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t75, t53, t69, t74, t40, t78, t74... t77, t46, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can start from the beginning:\n\nt75 is produced by NT32. Then, the next part would be NT14, which produces t74 (since NT14 -> t74).\n\nSo the first two parts: NT32 (t75) and NT14 (t74). So far, so good.\n\nThe third token is t69, which is produced by NT31. So after NT32, the next non-terminal is NT31 (t69). Then, the production for NT31 is NT6 and NT7. Looking at the rule: NT31 -> NT6 NT7. So to get t69, NT6 must produce t53 (since in the rules, NT6 -> t53).\n\nWait, NT6 -> t53 only once, but in the string, after t53 comes t69, which is t53 followed by t69. Let me check how that would work.\n\nNT31 -> NT6 NT7. So NT6 produces t53, and NT7 produces t69. But wait, in the string, after t53 is t69. So perhaps NT6 is t53 and NT7 is t69. Wait, looking back, NT7's production includes t40 (from the rules, NT7 -> t40). So I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The rule for NT7 is NT7 -> t40. So NT7 produces t40, not t69. Wait, that's inconsistent. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules: Let me check NT7. I don't see NT7 being a terminal. Looking at the rules:\n\nFrom the list provided, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t1\n...\nBut wait, no, I don't see that. Wait, actually, in the list, I see NT7 -> t40, among others. Wait no, looking again:\n\nThe rules list includes NT7 -> t40, among other possibilities. So NT7 can produce t40.\n\nBut in the string, the third token is t69, which must be produced by NT31. So NT31 -> NT6 NT7. So after NT32 produces t75, NT14 produces t74, the next part is NT31.\n\nBut NT31 produces NT6 and NT7. So after t75 and t74, the next two tokens would be NT6 and NT7.\n\nLooking at the string: t75 t53 t69...\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. After t75 (NT32), next would be NT14 (t74), then NT31 (t69? No, because in the rules, NT31 can produce various terminals, but t69 is one that I don't see. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT31 -> NT9 NT11\nNT31 -> NT6 NT7\nSo yes, NT31 can produce NT6 and NT7.\n\nSo the first four elements are:\n\nt75 (NT32), t53 (must be NT6), t69? No. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to break this down more carefully.\n\nStarting with the entire string: `t75 t53 t69 t74 t40 t78 t74 t77 t46 t71 t1 t80 t43 t34 t3 t40 t26 t1 t15 t68 t65 t46 t19 t1 t25 t71 t3 t77 t1 t1 t26 t78 t43 t26 t26 t78 t40 t74 t77 t69 t71 t42 t43 t69 t34 t1 t42 t19 t69`.\n\nSo tokens in pairs:\n\n1. t75\n2. t53\n3. t69\n4. t74\n5. t40\n6. t78\n7. t74\n8. t77\n9. t46\n10. t71\n11. t1\n12. t80\n13. t43\n14. t34\n15. t3\n16. t40\n17. t26\n18. t1\n19. t15\n20. t68\n21. t65\n22. t46\n23. t19\n24. t1\n25. t25\n26. t71\n27. t3\n28. t77\n29. t1\n30. t1\n31. t26\n32. t78\n33. t43\n34. t26\n35. t26\n36. t78\n37. t40\n38. t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-953","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, which usually makes parsing easier with algorithms like CYK, but I'm not going to use any algorithms here; it's more about reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap the grammar. The initial symbol is S, and S directly produces NT32 NT14, or it can produce NT18 NT32. So the entire string starting from S would consist of two parts: whatever NT32 produces and whatever NT14 produces, or whatever NT18 and NT32 produce.\n\nLooking at the provided string: it starts with t75, which I assume is a terminal symbol. Let's see if t75 is one of the terminal symbols in the grammar. Scanning the production rules, I see that several symbols like NT32, NT4, etc., have productions that eventually result in terminal 't' symbols. For example, NT32 can produce t75.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the two main parts connected by NT32 and NT14 or the other option NT18 and NT32.\n\nThe string is: t75 t74 t77 t3 t1 t43 t70 t43 t19 t69 t74 t42 t69 t78 t80 t40 t46 t40 t42 t40 t77 t63 t19 t69 t43 t59 t53 t26 t1 t46 t71 t77 t1 t63 t71 t26 t15 t69 t21 t46 t32 t69 t78 t80 t26 t75 t6 t78 t69 t69.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. Let's try to see the structure.\n\nIf we think of the grammar as S -> NT32 NT14 or S-> NT18 NT32, let's see which one is possible. The string starts with t75, which can be from NT32 NT14. So I would expect the first part to be NT32 and followed by NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t75, t74, t77... Let me check the production for NT32. From the grammar, NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT17 NT32 as well as others. Wait, but some symbols have multiple productions, like NT28 can produce NT21 NT25, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start from the given grammar and build the parse trees.\n\nWait, maybe I can approach this by seeing if the string can be segmented into two parts where the first part is the expansion of NT32 and the second part is the expansion of NT14. Alternatively, the first part could be NT18 and the second NT32.\n\nLooking at the string, the end is t69 t69. Let me check the productions that end with t69.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules: I see NT7 -> t1, but t69 is appearing at the end. Let me see where t69 comes from. In the grammar, NT6 -> t53, for example, and I don't immediately see t69 being a production of any NT, but wait, I notice that NT24 -> t72, and NT31 -> t69, and NT23 -> t21 when it's applicable. Maybe t69 is produced by NT21? Wait, checking the grammar, I don't see NT21 producing t69. Hmm, perhaps t69 is a terminal symbol, but I need to check all.\n\nWait, looking through all the terminals, the given productions have several 't' symbols as direct terminals. For example, I notice that S produces NT14, and in the grammar, NT14 has a production ending with t43, but that's a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to split the string into two segments, one ending with t14 and the other starting with t32, depending on which rule S is using.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t75. Let's find which NT parts generate t75. Since NT32 has a production: NT32 -> NT17 NT32. But I'm looking for something that produces t75. Let's see: in the grammar, does any symbol produce t75? Looking through the rules, NT32 has a production NT32 -> t75. Wait, is that the case? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see a production:\n\nLooking through:\n\nS-> NT32 NT14\nS-> NT18 NT32\nNT32 -> NT17 NT32\nNT32 also has NT32 -> NT12 NT7, and NT24 -> t72, etc. Wait, I might be misreading. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking for any symbol whose production ends in t75.\n\n- NT4 has NT4 -> t56\nBut that's just single steps.\n\nLooking closer:\n\nWait, perhaps NT32 has NT32 -> t75. Checking the given grammar:\n\nYes! Here it is: \"NT32 -> t75\".\n\nWait, but I see in the grammar rules: \"NT32 -> t75\" is a single production. So that's a way for NT32 to produce t75 in one step.\n\nSo, the first part of the string starts with t75, which can be from NT32. Then, the second part, after t75, should be generated by NT14. So, the next step is to check if the remaining string after t75 can be generated by NT14.\n\nWait, no, the initial split is S -> NT32 NT14. So, after NT32 produces t75, NT14 would need to produce the rest of the string. Alternatively, that entire string may be the result of NT32 followed by NT14, or vice versa, depending on which production S takes.\n\nWait, the string is: t75 followed by a whole lot more symbols. So if the first part is t75, that would come from NT32, and then the rest would come from NT14. But does NT14 produce any terminals? Let me check the grammar for NT14.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT14: From the grammar, I see \"NT14 -> t43\" as a single production. Is there any other production for NT14? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I only see NT14 -> t43 and that's it. So that means NT14 can only produce the single terminal t43. But if the string after NT32 (which is producing t75) is longer than t43, then that can't be it. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and S is using the other production: S -> NT18 NT32.\n\nSo, let's try that: NT18 would produce the first part, and NT32 would produce the second part.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t75. So if the first part is from NT18, would that produce t75? Let me check the productions for NT18. From the grammar, NT18 has production NT18 -> t49. So NT18 can only produce t49 in one step. But the string starts with t75, not t49, so that can't be it. Therefore, the original split S->NT32 NT14 is correct.\n\nThen, the first part is NT32, which produces t75, and the second part is NT14, which produces t43. But the second part of the string after t75 is much longer than a single 't43'. So either I'm missing something here, or perhaps NT32 and NT14 can produce more complex structures.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, perhaps NT32 has another production beyond just t75.\n\nLooking again: NT32 has several productions, including:\n\n- NT32 -> NT17 NT32\n- NT32 -> NT12 NT7\n- NT32 -> NT24 NT2\n- NT24 -> NT4 NT1\n- etc.\n\nWait, but the initial problem says that the grammar includes all these productions. So perhaps t75 is the only direct terminal of NT32, but perhaps other NTs contribute to the string.\n\nWait, maybe the string is built from both NT32 and NT14, which may have their own productions that generate more symbols. I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should look for whether there exists a way to split the string into two main parts, each corresponding to the expansion of NT32 and NT14, or NT18 and NT32.\n\nWait, the string starts with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-954","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The grammar looks a bit complex with a lot of non-terminals and terminals. My task is to determine if the given string `t75 t80 t78 t80 t1 t15 t15 t15 t68 t1 t46 t69 t78 t1 t42 t68 t1 t65 t15 t1 t1 t69 t74 t71 t3 t25 t77 t69 t3 t77 t78 t34 t68 t69 t74 t78 t1 t1 t77 t63 t42 t32 t15 t25 t69 t74 t71 t69 t69 t69` is a member of the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Chomsky Normal Form implies. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to be in CNF because each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNext, I need to verify if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using these production rules. However, manually applying all the productions step by step would be extremely time-consuming given the length of the string. So, I need a smarter approach.\n\nOne possible method is to perform a top-down parsing using the given grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string step by step. Alternatively, since this is a CNF grammar, a suitable parser like the Earley parser might be effective, but doing that manually is also quite involved.\n\nAnother approach is to identify which parts of the string can be matched with the productions. Since the grammar has many non-terminals, it's essential to look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it starts with `t75`, which might correspond to a production from S. The initial productions are S \u2192 NT32 NT14 or S \u2192 NT18 NT32. So, the first symbols would have to come from the productions of NT32 or NT18.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT32, possible productions are:\n- NT32 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT32 \u2192 NT18 NT24\n- NT32 \u2192 NT24 NT20\n- NT32 \u2192 NT4 NT32 (which is recursive, potentially problematic)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT3 NT32 (again, recursive)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT17 NT32 (recursive again)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT25 NT18\n- NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT2\n- NT32 \u2192 NT9 NT11\n- NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT17\n- NT32 \u2192 NT75 NT77\n- NT32 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nWait, I see that in the given grammar, there's a production NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT2. So, if S \u2192 NT32 NT14, then S would need to derive `t75` as the first symbol. But looking at the first production for NT32, I see that one of them is NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT2. So, NT30 could lead to a terminal symbol, and NT2 could also lead to a terminal. Let's check NT30.\n\nLooking at NT30's productions:\n- NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n- NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22\n- NT30 \u2192 other productions... Hmm, in the grammar, actually, after looking at the provided grammar, I see that NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22 (from line 30 and 33). \n\nWait, actually, checking the grammar, I see that line 33: NT30 \u2192 NT2 NT22 is not present. Let me re-examine the grammar sections.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nLine 30: NT30 -> NT3 NT30\n\nLine 31: NT31 -> NT9 NT11\n\nLine 32: NT14 -> NT31 NT21\n\nLooking further down, lines 28-29 (as provided in the user's snippet):\n\nLine 30: S -> NT18 NT32\n\nLines for NT30:\n- line 30: NT30 \u2192 NT3 NT30\n- line 32: NT31 -> NT9 NT11\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. The user's grammar is huge, so it's hard to find each NT30. Wait, looking again, on lines the user provided:\n\nIn the grammar, NT30 -> NT3 NT30 is somewhere. Yes, line 30: NT30 -> NT3 NT30.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is that another line? Let me see:\n\nLooking at the beginning of the grammar:\n\nThe user's grammar starts with:\n\n```S -> NT32 NT32\nS -> NT18 NT32\nNT30 -> NT3 NT30\nNT4 -> NT25 NT6\n...\n```\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT32 NT32, and that's it. So S has two productions: NT32 NT32 and NT18 NT32.\n\nBut in the initial grammar sections, I see that the grammar might have multiple productions for each non-terminal. For example, NT30's first production is line 30: NT30 -> NT3 NT30. Then line 32: NT31 -> ... etc. But actually, the user's grammar seems to have multiple lines for the same non-terminal. For example, each non-terminal often has multiple production rules, some terminal, some non-terminal.\n\nSo, going back, S can be NT32 NT32 or NT18 NT32.\n\nThe string starts with t75. So, the first part of the string is t75, which would have to come from a production of NT32 or NT18.\n\nLooking at NT32's productions, I see a production NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT2. If NT30 can produce a certain terminal, and NT2 can produce another terminal.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions, for example, NT2 \u2192 NT22 NT15, or NT2 \u2192 nt22 or others. There's also NT2 \u2192 NT34 NT17. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's see. NT32 can produce NT30 NT2. So the first step would be to produce NT30 NT2. So the first symbol from the string should be produced by these.\n\nBut the string starts with t75. So if t75 is the first symbol, it should come from either NT32 or NT18.\n\nLooking at NT32's productions, is there any that can produce t75? Let me scan the grammar. Looking through the production rules, I see a production: NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT2 (line 21 in the grammar), but do any of the NT30 or NT2 non-terminals produce t75?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for the t75 in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals have t's as their productions:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't1' (line 22)\nNT0 \u2192 't40' (line 024)\nNT2 \u2192 't80' (line ... perhaps line 80?) Wait, the grammar ends abruptly, but looking through the user's list:\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't25' etc. Wait, but looking for t75 specifically, perhaps it's in one of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, some of the productions are terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't22' (line 82)\n- NT3 \u2192 't1' (line 24)\n- NT4 \u2192 't56' (maybe line 56 or 43)\n- NT5 \u2192 't30' (line 59), 't19' (line 19), 't28' (line 17)\n- NT7 \u2192 't1' (line 46)\n- NT8 \u2192 't46' perhaps? Looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't11' (line ... Not sure, but in the string, we do have a 't' sequence.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is t75, then t80, then t78, etc. So perhaps I need to find which non-terminals can produce these t symbols.\n\nLet me first list where the terminals are in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't80' at line 20 (I think). Wait, actually, line 20 is NT24 \u2192 NT2 NT13. So not a terminal.\n\nLooking further:\n\nLooking through the list of grammar rules:\n\nWait"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
