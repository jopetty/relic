{"custom_id":"request-6","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t2\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The grammar starts with the initial symbol S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string we're evaluating must be derived from this. But our string is \"t2\", which seems pretty short.\n\nNext, I'll check the production rules to see if any of them directly produce \"t2\". Looking through the productions, I notice some NT symbols ending with \"t3\", \"t4\", etc., but nothing directly produces \"t2\". Hmm, maybe \"t2\" is produced indirectly through multiple steps.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules that result in terminals. It seems like some of the NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (Yes, that's one.)\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' or 't5' or 't6' etc.\nWait, but \"t2\" is the string. Let me check again. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (Wait, no, actually, maybe I misread. Let me go back.)\n\nWait, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through, I don't see any NTs directly producing \"t2\". But perhaps through chain productions. Let me try to find a path.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, each of these NTs must derive to some string, and when combined, should result in \"t2\".\n\nLooking at NT28: From the productions, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 would derive to whatever NT17 and NT7 produce.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So NT17 would derive to whatever NT1 and NT58 produce.\n\nThis seems like a long path. Let me try to see if this chain can result in \"t2\".\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production that ends in \"t2\". Let me check all the NT productions ending with 't'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' or 't5' or 't6'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (Is this correct? Wait, in the user input, under NT2: \"NT2 \u2192 't5'\" so yes, NT2 produces 't5'.\n\nWait, but I thought the string is \"t2\", which isn't \"t5\". So if NT2 \u2192 't5', that's not matching. So how do we get \"t2\"?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through all NT \u2192 'tX' again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 't2':\n\nOnly NT52 \u2192 't2' or NT others? Let me check:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'? Looking back: Yes, I think so. Let me check:\n\nSearch for NT52: NT52 \u2192 't2' is listed as option nt52 to 't2'.\n\nAh, so NT52 \u2192 't2' is a production. So if NT52 can derive 't2', then perhaps the string is generated through a series that ends at NT52 and produces 't2'.\n\nSo, the process is to see if the string can be produced by a series of productions leading to 't2'. Let me see.\n\nSo, the initial symbol is S, which splits into NT28 and NT17. So, I need to see how those can lead to something that combines to \"t2\".\n\nWait, but NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 would become NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nThen, each of these NTs would have to derive to something, and their concatenation should be \"t2\".\n\nWait, but the resulting string is one character: \"t2\". So perhaps one of the NTs must produce \"t2\", and the other two parts must be empty. But in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals, except the ones that produce terminals. So, a single NT can't produce two terminals unless they come from a chain.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in reverse. Let's try to see if \"t2\" can be the result of some NT production.\n\nLooking back, the terminal \"t2\" is produced by NT52. So, can we have a situation where in the derivation, one branch leads to NT52, which then produces 't2', and the other branches produce nothing.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky normal form, each production is two non-terminals, so the only way a terminal can appear is if one of the two branches is a terminal production.\n\nSo, maybe in the derivation, one of the NTs in S's production becomes NT52, which in turn becomes 't2', and the other NT becomes a terminal leading to empty.\n\nBut let me see: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nThen, let's say one of the NT17s leads to something.\n\nWait, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo, that would be NT17 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 ... etc. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way for the entire string to reduce to NT52, which then produces 't2'. But given the structure, perhaps S can't directly derive to a single NT, but only two. So unless one of those two derivations results in an empty string, which isn't possible in CNF because each production splits into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting tangled here. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nGiven that S starts as NT28 NT17, each of these leads to more NTs, which eventually lead to terminals. So for the string to be \"t2\", perhaps we need to have one NT producing 't2' and the other producing nothing. But in Chomsky normal form, all productions are two non-terminals, so unless one of them is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF each production is A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminal productions, which can be A \u2192 a. So, to get a single terminal in the string, perhaps one of the two non-terminals in a production must derive to a single terminal, and the other must derive to nothing, which is only possible if that other can produce epsilon, but in this case, it's not an option.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, epsilon can't be derived unless there's a production for a non-terminal to epsilon, which isn't present here. So each production is splitting into two non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, for the string to be \"t2\", one of the NTs must produce 't2', and the other must produce the empty string, which isn't possible because all non-terminals must derive to strings of non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for a single NT in the derivation to produce 't2' while the other produces nothing, because the other would have to be a non-terminal that can derive to 't2', which isn't the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way through longer paths. Let me try to trace a possible derivation.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo, we have NT1 NT58 NT7 NT1 NT58.\n\nNow, NT1 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT1 has several rules. For example, NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nSo, NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nSo now, the string would have more terms, which seems to be getting more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48.\n\nBut NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nWait, so that's getting even more non-terminals. I'm not seeing a clear path to \"t2\".\n\nMaybe I should approach this by trying to find all possible ways to derive single terminals from the grammar.\n\nBut the grammar doesn't seem to have any terminals except those defined as 't0' to 't5' which are in the NT productions. For example, NT6 \u2192 't4', NT9 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nSo, some non-terminals produce terminals, but to get a single 't2', we'd need a production where an NT directly produces 't2', which is only NT52.\n\nSo, can S derive a string that includes NT52 producing 't2'?\n\nLooking back, is there a way for S to lead to NT52 somewhere?\n\nWait, let's see. S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo, NT1 \u2192 ?\n\nNT1 can produce NT58 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-1","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), and I need to determine if the string \"t1\" is generated by this grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems to consist of all these kinds of productions, with start symbol S. Now, the question is whether \"t1\" can be produced by this grammar. \n\nThe string given is a single terminal symbol, \"t1\". In CNF, each terminal is a single symbol, so \"t1\" isn't a single terminal, it's a two-character string. But wait, in context-free grammars, terminals can be any single symbol, so \"t\" followed by \"1\" would have to be generated as a sequence of two terminal symbols. However, in the provided grammar, I see that most terminals are represented as single characters, like 't', '3', etc.\n\nWait, looking closer, the grammar's terminals aren't just single letters; some are multi-character strings. For example, I see productions like NT7 \u2192 't5', which suggest that terminals can have multiple digits or characters, perhaps. But \"t1\" is a two-character string where the second character is '1', which might not be present in any terminal production. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the terminals are represented here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing how the grammar is structured. The given grammar seems to have a mix. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17: that's two non-terminals being produced. Then NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47, another non-terminal splitting into two others. Going deeper, NT7 has several productions, like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, etc. Then, there are some NT rules that produce 't' followed by numbers, like NT17 \u2192 't3', NT54 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, but the string we're given is \"t1\". So I'm trying to see if there's any production in the grammar that can generate 't' followed by '1'. Looking through the terminals, I see things like NT17 \u2192 't3', which is 't' followed by '3', but nothing like 't1'. So perhaps the string \"t1\" isn't directly a terminal in the grammar. \n\nBut maybe the string \"t1\" can be derived by a series of productions. For example, maybe there's a path where NT17 is used, which produces 't3', but how would that lead to \"t1\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is built. Maybe each NT production eventually leads to a terminal. For example, NT27 can produce 't6', and maybe other non-terminals that can combine to form the 't1' string.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get 't1', I might need some non-terminal that can produce 't' followed by another non-terminal that produces '1'. But in the given productions, I don't see any non-terminals that produce '1's, except some that produce 't' followed by numbers like '3', '5', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look through the productions to see if there's a non-terminal that can directly produce 't' and another that produces '1', but I don't see any '1's as terminals. For example, in the grammar, most terminals are 't' followed by another number (like 't3', 't5', etc.), but not 't1'. So perhaps \"t1\" isn't directly possible, and maybe it's not possible through the given productions to get 't1' since there's no terminal that produces '1'.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S produces two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. NT28 then splits into NT17 and NT7, from NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Then NT7 has several options, including NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, but let's see where that leads. NT2 is NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10, and then NT54 can produce 't3' and 't10'. Wait, NT10: NT10 \u2192 NT23 NT26. NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, etc., but I don't see a way to get to 't1'.\n\nAlternatively, starting from S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So now we have NT17 and NT7. NT17 \u2192 't5' and NT27. Hmm, no, wait: NT7 has several productions, but I'm not sure if any of them produce 't1'. Wait, looking at NT27: it's NT27 \u2192 't6' and NT27 again. So that's a rule that produces 't6' followed by whatever NT27 produces. But the problem is, NT27 is recursive, which wouldn't help in getting 't1'.\n\nI think perhaps \"t1\" isn't in the language because there's no terminal production that leads to 't' followed by '1'. All terminals are like 't' followed by other digits (3,5, etc.), so 't1' wouldn't be directly possible.\n\nWait, is there any non-terminal that can produce '1'? I don't see any. All the terminals seem to start with 't' followed by another number, but nothing like '1'. So perhaps it's impossible to derive \"t1\".\n\nTherefore, the answer should be No, because there's no production in the grammar that can generate \"t1\".\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the problem and breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can generate certain languages, and each non-terminal has production rules. The string \"t2 t0\" seems to be in terms of symbols like t2, t0, which I assume are terminals because they appear on the right-hand side of the rules as literals. Looking at the grammar, I see that some symbols end with \"t\" like \"t3\", \"t5\", etc. These are likely the terminal symbols, representing the terminals in the language, which in this case are the t-something tokens. The others are non-terminals, like S, NT57, NT13, etc.\n\nNext, I need to see how \"t2 t0\" can be derived. In CFG, the string is generated by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions until only terminals remain.

So NT7 would need to produce t2 for NT28 to produce t2. But from NT7's productions, does it have a rule that results in t2?\n\nLooking through the NT7 productions again: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, which is a bit circular. Does NT19 produce t2? Looking back, I don't see NT19 directly producing t2. So maybe that's not the way.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check NT28 again. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 is made up of NT17 and NT7. Both non-terminals. So I need to expand NT17 and NT7 into t2 and t0 respectively, or t0 and t2. The order in the string is t2 and then t0, so the order in the grammar must match. So NT28 must expand to t2 and NT17 must expand to t0. Wait, no. If S is NT28 NT17, then if NT28 is t2 and NT17 is t0, then the string would be \"t2 t0\". So I need to see if each can be expanded.\n\nWait, but looking at the productions for NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT158 has other rules, but looking at the start, I see NT17 \u2192 't5'. Wait, wait, in the grammar, does NT17 have a production where it directly becomes a terminal?\n\nLooking back, I see a production: NT17 \u2192 't5'. Yes, so NT17 can directly produce t5. But in the string we have t0, so maybe that's not the way. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no, because the string is t2 t0, so the two non-terminals derived from S must produce t2 and t0 in that order. So I need to see if S can be expanded into t2 t0.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So for NT28, let's see if it can produce t2 and NT17 can produce t0.\n\nBut for NT28, the first production is NT17 NT7. So if NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and then NT17 is a non-terminal that can expand to NT1 NT58, but that might go into more non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a direct production where NT28 \u2192 t2 and NT17 \u2192 t0.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, do any of the NT28's have a direct terminal? Let's check NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nOther NT28's? No, only that one. So it seems NT28 can't directly produce t2 unless it goes through some chain.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see all possible ways S can be expanded into t2 and t0.\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17. So both NT28 and NT17 must be expanded into t2 and t0, but in some order. Let's see:\n\nOption 1:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nSo NT28 expands into NT17 and NT7.\n\nThen, NT17 can expand to 't5' as per NT17 \u2192 't5'. But in the string, we have t0, which is different. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe NT28 has another production? Looking back at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through NT28's productions, I see NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 and NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT43, but I don't see it directly being able to expand to t2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Maybe NT28 can produce t2 through some chain.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe I should see what NT7 can produce. NT7's productions include NT7 \u2192 't3' (looking at the last part of the grammar, near the end, I see NT36 \u2192 't4' and other t's, but near the end, I see:\n\nLooking back, I see that the grammar ends with some NT rules leading to 't':\n\nAt the very end, I see:\n\nNT51 \u2192 NT7 NT4\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44\nNT39 \u2192 NT0 NT33\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\nNT51 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n...\nNT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10\n...\nNT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n...\nNT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51\n...\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n...\nND4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n...\nWait, looking for 't' symbols, I don't see any of them being directly 't2' or 't0' except in the rules, but perhaps the initial productions don't have those terminals.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t2 or t0. The terminals seem to be like t3, t5, etc., but I don't see t0, t1, t2, etc. So perhaps the string is using these t-variables as the terminal symbols. Wait, the string given is \"t2 t0\", so it's in terms of t2 and t0, which are terminals.\n\nSo, for S to generate \"t2 t0\", S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so NT28 must derive to t2, and NT17 must derive to t0.\n\nSo first, checking NT28 \u2192 ... What does NT28 produce? Looking at the rules, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Then, each of these NTs must produce a terminal or further expand.\n\nNow, NT17 can directly produce 't5' because I see in the last part of the grammar, 'NT17 \u2192 't5''. So if NT17 \u2192 't5', but we need it to produce 't0', that would not work.\n\nWait, but the string is 't2 t0', so one is t2 and the other t0. So either:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t2 (but looking at the rules, NT28's productions are to other non-terminals), or\n\n- There's another way for NT28 to produce t2.\n\nWait, perhaps NT28 can go through a chain that results in t2. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT28:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNow, NT7 has several productions, including NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19.

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string \"t4 t1\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Okay, so first, I should probably look at the grammar rules and see how they can produce \"t4\" and \"t1\". \n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, the grammar has both kinds of productions: some produce terminals directly.\n\nLooking at the string \"t4 t1\", it's a sequence of two terminals. Each 't' is followed by a number, which suggests each 't' is a terminal symbol and the number is an index pointing to another non-terminal. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps each 't' is just a terminal, and the numbers are non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. Actually, in this context, each 't' is just 't3', 't4', 't5', etc., as per the rules. So 't4' and 't1' are terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar, some rules produce terminals like NT17 \u2192 't3', so the 't3' is the terminal string. So 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So \"t4\" and \"t1\" are terminals, and the string consists of these two terminals in order.\n\nSo the question is: can the grammar produce a string where the first terminal is 't4' and the second is 't1'.\n\nNow, looking at the start symbol S, which produces NT28 NT17. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then each of those non-terminals can split further.\n\nFirst, let's see where 't4' can come from. Looking at the rules, 't4' is produced by which non-terminals? Let's go through the rules.\n\nLooking at NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9 but that's not producing 't4'. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Wait, in the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT57 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo 't4' is produced by NT30 and NT38. 't1' isn't directly a terminal, but looking at the rules, it seems like 't1' is produced by NT1. Wait, looking back at the rules:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\nWait, no, 't1' isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT27 \u2192 't6', and NT9 \u2192 't3'. But 't1' isn't directly a terminal. So where does 't1' come from? Or is it 't1' as a terminal, but it's not present in the rules. Wait, maybe I need to check if 't1' is a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, 't' followed by numbers are terminals, like 't3', 't4', etc. So 't1' would be a terminal only if there's a production rule for it, which I don't see here. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal producing 't1'. The only non-terminals that produce terminals are those with rules like NT17 \u2192 't3', NT9 \u2192 't3', etc., but no 't1'.\n\nSo perhaps the string \"t4 t1\" is trying to have 't1' as a terminal, but in the grammar, it's not produced as a terminal. So that might mean the string is not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's double-check: in the grammar, is there any production for a non-terminal that leads directly to 't1'? Or is 't1' supposed to be a terminal?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15\n\nBut these are non-terminals, so to reach 't1', perhaps through a chain of productions. Alternatively, maybe 't1' is not in the grammar, meaning the string cannot be generated because 't1' is not present as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the rules, and there is a production that produces 't1'. Let me go through each rule to see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't1'. Hmm. So 't1' is not a terminal in this grammar. Therefore, the string \"t4 t1\" would have to have 't1' as a terminal symbol, but since there's no rule in the grammar for any non-terminal to produce 't1', it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string with 't1' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but maybe it's possible through a series of productions. For instance, maybe a non-terminal can be reduced to 't1' through a series of steps, but looking at the rules, none of the non-terminals seem to produce 't1'. So I think 't1' cannot be derived as a terminal in this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t4 t1\" cannot be generated because the second part, 't1', is not a terminal and there's no rule in the grammar that produces it.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t6 t3 t1`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for algorithms like the CYK parser, but I'm not sure if I need to use a parser here. Instead, maybe I can use a step-by-step approach to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the derivation begins with NT28 generating some string, and NT17 generating another, which then combines to form the output string.\n\nI notice that the string we have is `t6 t3 t1`. So three terminals in sequence. I need to find a way to derive this by applying the productions.\n\nFirst, let me list the productions that produce terminals directly. Looking through the grammar, terminals are things like 't3', 't4', 't5', etc. But I need to see where 't6', 't3', 't1' come from.\n\nLooking at the productions where terminals are on the right side:\n\nNT38 \u2192 t8 t51\nBut I don't have those in the target string. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by breaking down the string into three parts: t6, t3, t1.\n\nBut looking at the non-terminals, I can see NT35, NT13, etc., but I need to see how these can produce 't6', 't3', and 't1'.\n\nWait, 't1' appears in NT32's production: NT32 \u2192 t1. So if I can get NT32 to produce 't1', then one part is covered.\n\nSimilarly, 't3' can be produced by NT54 with production NT27 \u2192 t6, but that doesn't directly help. Alternatively, looking at NT43 \u2192 t2, but that's not t3. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's look at NT3's production: NT3 is a non-terminal that can go to t3. Because in the grammar, there's NT3 \u2192 t3. So if I have NT3 in the production, it can produce 't3'.\n\nBut in the string, we have t6, t3, t1. So maybe NT3 can produce 't3' somewhere.\n\nWait, but I also have NT3 \u2192 t3 in the grammar, so that's one part.\n\nNow for t6: Looking at the productions, NT33 has two options: NT33 \u2192 t3 t6 or NT33 \u2192 t6 t5. Also, NT35 \u2192 t6 t1.\n\nWait, let's see. If I have NT35 \u2192 t6 t1, that would give me t6 and t1. So t6 is part of t6 t1, and t1 is separate, but in our target string, we have t6, then t3, then t1. So that suggests that perhaps NT35 produces t6 and t1 together, but we also need a t3 in between. \n\nAlternatively, maybe NT33 can produce t3 and t6, thus allowing for 't6 t3' when combined with another production.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let me try to see how to get a production that ends in t6 t3 t1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if the entire string can be derived from NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S's expansion starts with NT28 generating a string, followed by NT17 generating another. So the total string will be the concatenation of NT28's produce and NT17's produce.\n\nWe have the string `t6 t3 t1`, which is three terms. So each NT must produce their parts.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT28 NT17, then NT28 must produce something ending with t6, and NT17 must produce something ending with t3 t1. Wait, but the string is t6 t3 t1, so maybe NT28 produces t6, and NT17 produces t3 t1. Or maybe NT28 produces t6 t3, and NT17 produces t1. But that's getting into splitting the string into parts which may not align with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for how NT28 and NT17 can produce these terms.\n\nLooking at NT28: in the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28's production is NT17 followed by NT7. So if I can find what NT17 and NT7 produce, perhaps that can help.\n\nLooking further, NT17 \u2192 t5. So NT17 produces 't5'. Okay, so NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 t5 followed by NT7's production.\n\nWhat does NT7 produce? Let's see. NT7 has several productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT4 NT48\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the list, I think I might have some confusion here. Let me scan the grammar properly.\n\nLooking for NT7's productions: I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nWait, but in the initial list, the NT7 productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nAlso, later in the list, not sure, but perhaps in the main body, there's also NT7 -> NT13 NT30 and NT7 -> NT4 NT48.\n\nSo NT7 has these possible productions. Let me note that.\n\nAlso, in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 NT14 NT24 (Wait, checking again: the initial list shows N7 has other productions like NT7->NT2 NT19, NT7->NT13 NT30, NT7->NT4 NT48, etc.)\n\nSo what do these produce?\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10. So NT2 would produce the combination of NT54 and NT10.\n\nSimilarly, NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5. NT53 has a production to NT44 NT21, but let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map each of these non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, maybe starting from the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, I know NT17 \u2192 t5, so one part is t5.\n\nSo S's expansion is NT17 followed by NT7 followed by NT17. So the overall string will be [NT17's production] [NT7's production] [NT17's production].\n\nSince NT17 \u2192 t5, the first and third parts are t5 each, and the second part is whatever NT7 produces.\n\nBut our target string is t6 t3 t1. So if the entire expansion is t5 (from NT17) + NT7's expansion + t5 (from NT17), that would give us a string with at least three terms, but with the middle part possibly having multiple terms.\n\nWait, but if NT7's expansion itself produces multiple terms, then the total could be longer.\n\nWait, but our target has three terms: t6, t3, t1. So perhaps NT7 produces t6, and somehow t3 and t1 are produced as part of another expansion, but I'm not sure if that aligns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT28 is producing t6, while NT17 is producing t3 t1.\n\nBut wait, NT17 \u2192 t5, so that's not possible. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is the correct starting point. But perhaps S can expand differently.\n\nWait, no, the grammar says S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts from NT28 and NT17.\n\nBut what's NT28's production? It's NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28's expansion is the same as before: t5 (from NT17) followed by NT7's expansion.\n\nSo let's see: the overall string would be [t5][NT7's string][t5]. So for the target string t6 t3 t1, perhaps I can think of it as t6 t3 t1 being part of the middle NT7's string, but that would require the middle part to produce those terms while the first and third parts are t5 each. But our target is only three terms, so that's conflicting because if NT7 produces more than one term, we'll have more than three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I got the start wrong. Maybe S can expand into something else.

{"custom_id":"request-23","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the string \"t3 t3 t4\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding what the grammar rules are and how they can produce the target string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a context-free grammar, so each production has a single non-terminal on the left, and the right side consists of two non-terminals. That means any derivation will take a string of non-terminals and replace them step by step until all are replaced by terminals ('t's and numbers, I assume).\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first rule for S is S -> NT28 NT17. So to reach the target string, I need to derive from S, then from NT28 and NT17, which will eventually generate the t's.\n\nLet me see NT28's rule: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So NT28 can be replaced by NT17 and NT7. Then NT17 has a rule: NT17 -> 't5'. Wait, looking back, it says NT17 -> 't5' (since the last line has NT17 -> 't5').\n\nWait, I think I might have misread earlier. Let me check the rules again. Oh, under NT17, I see: NT17 -> 't5'. That's a terminal! So NT17 produces 't5'. So in S, when we do S -> NT28 NT17, and then NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and NT17 is 't5', and NT7 needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT7: The rules for NT7 include NT7 -> NT4 NT48 and NT7 -> NT13 NT30, etc. I need to see which path can eventually produce 't3' and 't4' as needed.\n\nOur target string is \"t3 t3 t4\". So we have three t's: two 't3's and one 't4'. Each of these must come from some terminal rule.\n\nLet's think about each part. Starting from S, which splits into NT28 and NT17. NT17 we've determined is 't5', which is one of the t's. But in the string we need, we have 't3', 't3', 't4'. So that's three t's, but S leads to two non-terminals, each of which might produce more terminals.\n\nWait, but S -> NT28 NT17. If NT17 is 't5', but the target string is \"t3 t3 t4\", that's three t's, but the first part of S is NT28, which would produce some string, and NT17 produces 't5'. So the total would be 't5' plus the string from NT28, which would need to be 't3 t3'.\n\nHmm, but the target string is \"t3 t3 t4\", which has three t's. But that's impossible because S starts with S -> NT28 NT17, meaning the final string would have two more parts from NT28 and NT17. If NT17 is 't5', which is a single t, then NT28 must produce a string that is 't3 t3 t4' minus 't5', but that's not possible because the final string would be three t's, and NT17 gives one, so NT28 would have to produce two 't's, which isn't possible because NT28's productions seem to lead to more terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me step through it more carefully.\n\nLet's break down the string \"t3 t3 t4\".\n\nWe need to find a derivation that leads to this string. Let's think about how S can produce this.\n\nS starts as S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 and NT17 each produce a sequence of terminals, and together they form the string \"t3 t3 t4\". Since the string has three parts, one from NT28 and two from NT17? Wait, no, the production S -> NT28 NT17 means S is replaced by the concatenation of what NT28 produces and what NT17 produces. So if NT28 produces 't3 t3' and NT17 produces 't4', then the overall string would be \"t3 t3 t4\", which matches.\n\nSo the string can be split into \"t3 t3\" from NT28 and \"t4\" from NT17.\n\nBut NT17's rule is NT17 -> 't5', not 't4'. Wait, I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the ND17 rules again. I see NT17 -> 't5', so NT17 never produces 't4'. So if NT17 is 't5', then the string would be \"t5\" plus what NT28 produces, but we need \"t3 t3 t4\". So that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe there's another path. Let me see. Maybe NT17 can't directly produce 't4' because in the given rules, NT17 only has a rule that produces 't5'. So perhaps I'm wrong about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is meant to be \"t3 t3 t4\" but NT17 can't produce 't4'. So perhaps the answer is No. But that seems too quick. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe the 't4' comes from NT28. Let me see. Let's look at the target string again: \"t3 t3 t4\". That would mean that the production from S would have to be \"t3 t3\" from NT28 and \"t4\" from NT17. But as established, NT17 can't produce 't4', only 't5'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is parsed differently. Let me consider that perhaps NT28 and NT17 produce more parts. Wait, maybe the split isn't as straightforward as S -> NT28 NT17, but let me think about other possibilities.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assigning which non-terminals go where. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nAnother approach: trying to build the string \"t3 t3 t4\" top-down.\n\nThe string has three terminals: the first two are 't3's, and the last is 't4'. The question is, can S produce these via the given rules.\n\nLet me see what S can produce. S -> NT28 NT17. So if NT28 can produce the first two 't3's and NT17 can produce the 't4', but as I thought earlier, NT17 can't produce 't4', it only produces 't5'. So that suggests it's impossible, which might mean the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another split. Wait, the string is three tokens, so perhaps one of the NTs produces two tokens, and the other produces one. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's try to see where 't4' can be produced.\n\nLooking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce 't3' or 't4':\n\nFrom the initial state, I see that NT9 -> 't3' and NT5 -> 't2', etc. Let me check where 't3' and 't4' appear.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT9 -> 't3', and NT28 is part of the production of S. Also, NT27 -> 't6', NT21 -> 't0', NT35 -> 't6', etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to find which non-terminals can produce 't3' and 't4'.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 -> 't3' (I think through some rules), but also NT6 -> 't4'.\n\nWait, let me check: in the rules, NT3 has a rule NT33 -> NT56 NT33, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce 't3' or 't4'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3: At the bottom, I see NT3 -> 't3' (I think). Let me check the full list. Yes, towards the end, there's NT32 -> 't1', NT15 -> 't0', NT6 -> 't4', and NT5 -> 't2'.\n\nWait, actually, in the list, under NT3, I don't see an explicit rule except in rules where it's a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nAt the very end, NT3 -> 't3' appears as a part of a rule: \"NT33 -> NT56 NT33\" and \"NT32 -> t1\", but maybe I'm misremembering. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me find where 't3' is produced.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3' is not present directly, but perhaps through expansion.\n\nWait, looking back, the rule says:\n\n\"NT3 -> NT19 NT55\"\n\nBut NT19 is a terminal (since I see later lines like NT19 -> 't5', etc.)."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t3 t2 t6 t0`. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right. So, I need to see if I can derive the given string using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT28 NT17. Each of these is a non-terminal. So, I'll need to see what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nLet me start by expanding NT28. From the rules, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So, NT28 becomes NT17 and NT7.\n\nThen, NT17 has two options: it can be NT1 NT58 or NT58. Wait, NT17 is broken down into NT1 and NT58. So, expanding NT17 could give us NT1 and NT58. But NT1 can be further expanded into NT48 and NT7. Let me see the rules for NT1: NT1 -> NT58 NT41 and NT41 -> NT45 NT15, and NT45 -> NT56 NT33, and so on. This seems complicated, but maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string and see if I can match it to the production rules. The string is t3 t2 t6 t0. Each t seems to correspond to a terminal that comes from NT3, NT2, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a 't' or specific terminals. For example, NT4 -> 't2' (NT4 produces 't2'), NT5 -> 't4', NT6 -> 't3' (wait, NT6 is 't3'? Or wait, looking back: NT6 -> 't4' and NT3 is 't3' (from NT3 -> 't3') right?\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, some NT rules directly produce terminals. Let's list them out:\n\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT5 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT11 -> 't2', 't5'\n- NT17 -> 't5' (since NT17 -> 't5')\n- NT2 --> 't5' (from NT2 -> NT27 NT17. Wait, NT27 can produce 't6' and NT17 is 't5', so NT2 is 't5 t6'?\nWait, no. NT27 has a rule NT27 -> NT4 NT3. Wait, no, looking back: NT27 has production NT27 -> NT17 NT27. Wait, actually, in the grammar, it's written differently. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- NT17 -> 't5' (since in the rules, NT17 directly goes to 't5'? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are as follows:\n\nLooking at the bottom of the grammar: \n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nAh, right, in the rules, NT17 directly produces 't5'. So that's a terminal. Similarly, NT2 -> 't5' (since NT2 -> NT27 NT17, but wait, wait: NT27 is a non-terminal that can expand, but wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, the rules are written as:\n\n- NT27 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n\nSo, NT27 can be NT4 NT3, which would be 't2 t3'. Then, if a rule for NT27 expands to that. But wait, there's another rule: NT27 -> NT51 NT27. So it can recursively expand. But in the string, we have t6, which is 't6'.\n\nLooking further down, NT36 is 't5' and NT30 is 't4' (from NT30 -> 't4'), and NT33 is 't6' (since NT33 -> NT35 NT6, and in another rule, NT33 can be NT55 NT6, and NT55 can be NT29 NT54, etc., but maybe directly, NT33 is 't6')? Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT52 -> 't2' (from NT52 -> 't2')\n- NT54 -> 't3' (NT54 -> 't3')\n- NT57 -> 't3' (NT57 -> 't3')\n- NT20 -> 't4' (from NT20 -> 't4' because in the rules, NT20 -> NT52 NT26, but also NT20 has a rule NT20 -> NT43 NT47, etc. Wait, but looking elsewhere: NT20 can also directly produce 't4'?\n\nWait, in the bottom of the grammar, under NT20, I see:\n\nNT20 -> NT52 NT26\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT26 -> NT0 NT10, which may not be terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Since the string is t3 t2 t6 t0, let's see how this could be derived.\n\nLooking for 't3's, 't2's, etc. So t3 is produced by NT3 -> 't3' (from NT3), t2 by NT4 -> 't2', t6 could be produced by NT33 -> 't6', and t0 by NT21 -> 't0' (since NT21 -> 't0').\n\nSo let's try to build the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nNow, NT17 can go to 't5', so let's take that.\n\nNT28 becomes 't5' and NT7.\n\nNow, NT7 has two rules: NT7 -> NT2 NT19 or NT7 -> NT13 NT30.\n\nHmm, to get 't2', that could be from NT7 -> NT2 NT19, where NT2 is 't2'.\n\nSo let me choose that path. So S becomes 't5' followed by NT7 (t2) and NT19.\n\nWait, no, S is NT28 NT17, so S -> (t5) and (something else). Wait, I think I messed up.\n\nWait, S is NT28 NT17. So first production is S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S becomes NT17, NT7, NT17.\n\nNow, let's expand all NT17's. Since NT17 -> 't5', each NT17 becomes 't5'.\n\nSo now we have t5, NT7, t5.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT7. NT7 has options:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\n2. NT7 -> NT13 NT30.\n\nWe need to see which option can give us 't2 t3' because the string is t3 t2 t6 t0, and so far we have t5, then we need to get t2 t3, but it's unclear. Maybe this path is not helpful. Let me consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps instead of expanding S first, I should look for how the string can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is t3 t2 t6 t0.\n\nLooking at the end, the last element is t0, which comes from NT21 -> 't0'.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation ends with ... NT21 -> 't0'.\n\nTo get t0, we need to have a rule that leads to that.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT21 -> 't0' is possible? Wait, no. Let's check: \n\nIn the grammar, NT21's rules are:\n\nNT21 -> NT35 NT2\n\nand \n\nNT21 -> NT38 NT11.\n\nNo, wait, looking at the bottom:\n\nLooking for NT21:\n\n- NT21 -> NT35 NT2\n\n- NT21 -> NT38 NT11\n\nHmm, not directly producing 't0'. Wait, where does 't0' come from? In the bottom rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n\nAh, so 't0' is produced by NT0, which is expanded by NT12 -> NT19 NT41, etc. Wait, no, NT0 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, NT0 is defined as producing 't5'. So, NT0 -> 't5'.\n\nWait, that seems important. So any NT0 in the derivation would produce 't5', not 't0'. But in the string, we have 't0', which is a terminal. So is there a rule that produces 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-27","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t3 t3 t5 t6` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me look at the grammar and figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to check is in terms of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be derived from a production that ends in a terminal.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the productions, I notice that many non-terminals produce two terminals followed by another non-terminal. For example, NT38 goes to NT8 NT51, but NT8 goes to NT43 NT47, and so on. This suggests that not all non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to check is `t3 t3 t5 t6`. So each of these must be a direct production from some non-terminal.\n\nLet me check each symbol in the string:\n\n1. t3: I look through the productions and see that NT7 goes to NT2 NT19 and NT2 goes to 't5', but wait, NT2's production is 't5'. Hmm, maybe I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't3'.\n\nWait, I see that NT38 goes to NT8 NT51, which are both non-terminals. NT8 goes to NT43 NT47, NT43 goes to NT5 NT36, NT5 goes to NT43 NT24, and so on. That seems too deep. Maybe that's not where 't3' comes from.\n\nLooking at the productions for 't's:\n- NT53 goes to 't1' and NT13.\n- NT7 goes to 't5'.\n- NT3 goes to 't3'.\n- NT15 goes to 't0'.\n- NT30 goes to 't4' and 't3'.\n- NT38 goes to 't4' and 't51'.\n- NT44 goes to 't14' and other stuff.\nHmm, I see NT3 goes to 't3', so if 't3' comes from NT3.\n\nSimilarly, another 't3' could also come from NT3.\n\nNow, 't5' is in the string. Looking at productions, I see NT30, NT29, NT20, NT2 go to 't5'. Wait, NT57 goes to NT7 NT9, and NT7 goes to 't5' eventually? Let me see: NT7 -> NT13 NT30, but NT13 -> NT1 NT7, which cycles. Alternatively, NT7 can go to NT4 NT48. Wait, NT4 is 't2', and NT48 can go to NT20 NT26 or other paths. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe we can find a derivation where S leads to the string step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT28 NT17. So the first production is S = NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, let's expand NT28. Looking at the productions, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So replacing NT28 with NT17 NT7. Then, NT17 -> 't5' as per the given productions. So the first part is 't5'.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't3', but here we have 't5' at the beginning, which doesn't match. Hmm, so maybe this is not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can expand differently. Let me see if there are other productions starting with S.\n\nWait, the only production for S is S -> NT28 NT17. So first symbol must come from NT28's first part or second part. No, the productions are S -> NT28 NT17, not split into separate symbols. So during expansion, S will generate NT28 NT17, each of which can go to other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, let me re-express the production. S isNT28 NT17. So when we start, we have to expand both of these. Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, the initial S is NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, let's look at NT28. It can go to NT17 NT7. So let's choose that. So NT28 becomes NT17 NT7. Now, the string so far is NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, no, the initial S is two non-terminals: NT28 and NT17.\n\nExpanding NT28 to NT17 NT7 gives us NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nEach of these NTs will need to be expanded further. But let's see:\n\nNT28 expands to NT17 NT7, which then can expand NT17 to 't5', and NT7 to either 't5' or further. Hmm, but in our string, the first symbol is 't3', which doesn't match 't5'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different expansion path for S. Let me check other possible expansions for NT28.\n\nWait, NT28's production is only NT17 NT7. So that's fixed. So first, NT28 is 't5' followed by the expansion of NT7.\n\nHmm, but our string starts with 't3'. Maybe I need to find another way.\n\nWait, perhaps S can't produce the string because the first symbol is 't3', but S's expansion starts with 't5' in the NT28 part. So maybe that's a dead end.\n\nAnother approach: Let's see if any non-terminal can produce 't3' as the first symbol. For example, NT3 is 't3', so perhaps NT3 can be used somewhere.\n\nBut how do I get from S to NT3?\n\nLooking at S's production, it's NT28 NT17. To get NT3, let's see if any production can lead to NT3.\n\nIf any of the non-terminals can be expanded into NT3 and then to 't3', that would help.\n\nLooking at NT3's production, it's NT19 NT5. NT19 might expand to something that leads to 't3', but that's going too deep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible because the start symbol's expansion leads to 't5' first, and our string starts with 't3'.\n\nIs there any way to derive 't3' as the first symbol from S?\n\nWait, maybe S can expand differently, but according to the given grammar, S only has one production: S -> NT28 NT17. So there's no alternative. So the initial step is fixed: S becomes NT28 NT17, which becomes (after expanding NT28 and NT17 further) some combination of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSince the first symbol in the string is 't3', and the initial expansion would have 't5' as the first symbol from NT28's expansion, it seems impossible to generate a string starting with 't3' from S.\n\nBut let me make sure by looking at the possible expansions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28's only production is NT17 NT7. So NT28 expands to NT17 NT7, which when expanded further would be (as per NT17 and NT7):\n\nNT17 -> 't5' or (other possibilities?), but looking at the given productions, NT17 leads to 't5' when it goes to 't5' directly via production NT7 -> NT13 NT30 and then further steps. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, NT7's production is NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30 or NT4 NT48.\n\nLet me take each possibility:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT2 NT19: NT2 goes to 't5', and NT19 might expand further.\n\n2. NT7 -> NT13 NT30: NT13 goes to NT1 NT7 or NT4 NT48.\n\n3. NT7 -> NT4 NT48: NT4 is 't2' and NT48 -> NT20 NT26 or other options.\n\nThis path seems to produce 't5' at some point, but maybe there's a way to have 't3' come first without being stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps any expansion starting from S can't produce a string beginning with 't3' because the first step in S's expansion always starts with 't5' and 't7', leading to more terminals downstream.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a way for S to expand into a string that, after more steps, includes 't3' before 't5'. Let me think deeper.\n\nSuppose after expanding S, we get NT17 NT28 (since S is NT28 NT17, and maybe NT28 can expand differently?), no, NT28's only production is NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The initial S is NT28 NT17, so the expansion for NT28 is NT17 NT7, and NT17 could expand further. So the initial string after S expands is:\n\nNT17 NT7 NT17, but actually, it's NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-47","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t1 t1 t4 t0 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols (like S, NT57, NT40, etc.) and some terminals represented by `t` followed by a number. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's `t1 t1 t4 t0 t3`. Since this is a series of terminals, I need to check if the non-terminals can expand into this sequence through the productions in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT28 NT17. So S expands into two parts: NT28 and NT17. Each of these can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT17, I see from the rules that NT17 can produce either something or expand into 't5'. Specifically, I see that NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and also NT17 -> NT14 NT27. Hmm, I should check if any of these produce 't1' when expanded.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, NT17 -> 't5'. So that production directly gives 't5', which is exactly the fifth component of the string. So that might work.\n\nBut wait, that's just the last part. The string has five parts, so let me break down the entire string and see how it might fit into the grammar.\n\nLet's consider each part of the string:\n\nt1, t1, t4, t0, t3.\n\nI need to see if these can be derived from the initial symbols produced by S.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo after the first step, we have NT28 and NT17. Let's see what these can produce.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 can produce NT17 NT7. Let's see NT17:\n- NT17 can produce 't5' directly. So if we take NT17 -> 't5', we get the last part.\n\nSo the last part t3 is from 't5'? Wait, no, t3 is 't3', but in the grammar, NT17 can produce 't5'. So perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, in the grammar, the terminal symbols are written as, for example, NT17 -> 't5'. So that production for NT17 is 't5', not 't3'. So the last t in the string is 't3', but NT17 can only give 't5'. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again. Oh, in the grammar, I see NT17 has a rule NT17 -> 't5'. So the last 't3' is 't3', but the production for NT17 gives 't5', which would mean that t3 cannot come from NT17. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 is part of another production. Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S isn't the direct parent of t1 t1 t4 t0 t3. Maybe through a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working from the string backwards, using the reverse of the grammar rules, i.e., using the string as the right-hand side and trying to reduce it to the start symbol.\n\nBut since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals on the left, and all productions are left-associative with a terminal or another non-terminal on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to construct a parse tree for the string `t1 t1 t4 t0 t3` and see if it can be generated by S.\n\nLet me see if I can find a production for a non-terminal that can generate 't1' sequences.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT3 -> 't3', NT5 -> 't5', NT4 -> 't2', NT11 -> 't2', NT21 -> 't0', etc. So for example, perhaps one of the NT symbols can produce 't1' as a combination of other symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that each production in the grammar is a binary tree. So each non-terminal can generate symbols either directly (if it has a terminal production) or by two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to expand each part of the string starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string is `t1 t1 t4 t0 t3`. Let me see if each of these can be part of a production chain.\n\nFirst, t1: which non-terminals produce t1? Let's look at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any direct production to 't1'. Only 't0', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5'. So perhaps 't1' must be generated indirectly through a non-terminal.\n\nLooking for NT symbols that can produce terminal 't1' as part of their expansion.\n\nFor example, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't2' or 't0' etc.\n- Other NTs produce combinations like NT28 -> NT17 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps NT7 is involved. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT7, its productions include:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT53 NT5\n- And another one: NT7 -> NT13 NT30, etc.\n\nHmm, do any of these lead to 't1'? Let's see:\n\nIf NT7 can produce NT2 NT19, then what do those produce?\n\nNT2 has a production: NT2 -> NT54 NT10. Then NT54 can produce 't3' via rule NT54 -> 't3', and NT10 -> 't0' (since the grammar for NT10 is produced by NT23 -> NT17 NT27, etc., but looking in the rules, I see NT10 -> 't0' under NT10: 't0'? Wait, no, in the grammar, looking at the lines, NT10 is produced as NT10 -> NT17 NT21. But looking through all the rules, perhaps there's a direct production for NT10.\n\nWait, yes, looking back, I see lines like NT52 -> NT20 NT36, etc. But perhaps I missed NT10. Let me check again.\n\nYes, I see: \"NT10 -> NT17 NT21\", which is a production, but it's also in another part: \"NT10 -> NT23 NT26\", etc. Wait, no, looking through, the specific line is \"NT10 -> NT23 NT26\".\n\nBut perhaps there's a direct terminal production. Wait, looking through all the rules: no, NT10's productions are:\n\n- NT10 -> NT17 NT21\n- NT10 -> NT23 NT26\n- NT10 -> NT52 NT29\n- NT10 -> NT36 NT21 (I think? Or does NT10 have such a production?)\n\nWait, looking back, the rules go up, and I see NT10's rule is \"NT10 -> NT23 NT26\". That's the only production. So NT10 can't produce any terminal. Therefore, NT10 must be further expanded into NT23 and NT26.\n\nSo back to the earlier step, if NT7 can produce NT53, for example, NT53 has a production \"NT53 -> NT12 NT23\" and \"NT53 -> NT6 NT56\".\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nLet me think about the string `t1 t1 t4 t0 t3`. The length is five, so I need a derivation that has five steps or so.\n\nAnother approach is to look for a possible parse tree where the leaves are the given string.\n\nLet me see if there's a way the start symbol S can produce multiple NTs that, when expanded, give the string.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17.\n\nTake S: NT28 NT17, so let's expand these.\n\nFirst, NT17 can produce 't5'. So the last part is 't5' but the string ends with 't3', so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, unless I can find another path. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking NT17 can only produce 't5'.\n\nLooking at S: NT28 and NT17. So I should check all possible ways to expand these.\n\nNT28: from the rules, production is NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S expands to NT17 NT7 | NT17 NT17 (but only if it's possible, but more likely to be NT17 NT7 or something else).\n\nWait, no, the rule"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have a task here where I need to determine if the given string `t6 t4 t3 t3 t2` can be generated by a provided context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is given with a bunch of production rules, and each non-terminal can produce two other non-terminals or a terminal. My string has five tokens: t6, t4, t3, t3, t2. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, or a terminal. That's useful because it tells me the grammar can generate strings where the number of symbols matches the depth of the parse tree, considering terminals as leaves.\n\nLooking at the string `t6 t4 t3 t3 t2`, I notice that t6, t4, t3, t3, t2 are all terminals, and each appears once except t3 which appears twice. The length of the string is 5 symbols, so it's an odd length. Since each production either combines two non-terminals or introduces one terminal, the number of terminals in the string must correspond to the number of steps in the derivation.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production adds one non-terminal or replaces with two. So starting from S (which is a non-terminal), each application of a production increases the number of symbols in the string by 0 (if it's a terminal) or 1 (if it's two non-terminals). So for a string of length n, the minimal number of steps needed is n-1. Since our string has 5 terminals, we'll need a derivation that starts from S and applies 5 substitutions, each adding one non-terminal, but wait, actually, each substitution that replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals increases the count. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently.\n\nI should probably try to find a derivation path from S to the string `t6 t4 t3 t3 t2`. Let's break down the string and see if each part can be produced by some rule.\n\nFirst, let's see how the terminals appear. The order is t6, t4, t3, t3, t2. So the string is t6 followed by t4, then two t3s, then t2.\n\nI'll start by noticing that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce t6, t4, etc.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string:\n\n- t6 is produced by NT33, according to the rules. Specifically, NT33 \u2192 t6, as per `NT33 -> t6`. Wait, let me check the given rules. The grammar has rules like `NT33 -> t6` and `NT30 -> t3`. So the terminals are mostly directly associated with certain non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe rules are a bit tricky. Let me list them all out to see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule, I notice:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't3' (from `NT17 -> 't5'`? Wait no. Wait, in the given rules, the only terminal strings are where NT53, NT55, etc., go to 't's. For example, `NT19 -> 't4'`, `NT35 -> 't2'`, `NT14 -> 't5'`, etc.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the production rules.\n\nIn the given grammar, many rules are written as NTx -> NTy NTz, but some directly go to 't's.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `NT33 -> t6`\n- `NT32 -> t1`\n- `NT52 -> t2`\n- `NT3 -> t3`\n- `NT9 -> t3`\n- `NT15 -> t0`\n- `NT5 -> t5`\n- `NT27 -> t6`\n- `NT29 -> t5`\n- `NT30 -> t3`\n- `NT27 -> t1`\n- `NT38 -> t4`\n- `NT17 -> 't5'`\n- `NT54 -> 't3'`\n- `NT11 -> 't2'`\n- `NT0 -> 't5'`\n\nWait, so let me list all the terminals:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT21 \u2192 t0 (since NT21 \u2192 t0? Wait, looking at the rules: `NT21 -> 't0'` yes.\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT54 \u2192 t2? Wait, looking at `NT54 -> 't3'`? No, `NT54 -> t3` but in the string, we have t2. So NT54 can't produce t2 in the string we have.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- So, what's producing t2? Maybe NT54, but it's producing 't3' or NT52? Let me see: `NT52 -> t2`? No, looking at the rules, `NT52 -> 't2'`? Let me check.\n\nYes, here's a rule: `NT52 -> t2` (as per `NT52 -> t2`). So NT52 can produce t2. Similarly, NT32 \u2192 t1, which is `NT32 -> t1`.\n\nNow, for the string `t6 t4 t3 t3 t2`, let's see how each terminal can be produced.\n\n- t6 is produced by NT27 (from `NT27 -> 't6'`).\nWait, no, looking at the rules: `NT27 -> 't6'` and `NT38 -> 't4'`. So NT27 gives t6, and NT38 gives t4.\n\nt3 can be from NT27, NT30, NT3, NT6 (if such exists), etc. Wait, in the rules, NT30 is defined as `NT30 -> NT15 NT30`, but looking for direct t3. There's a rule `NT3 -> t3` (from `NT3 -> 't3'`). So NT3 produces t3.\n\nWait, but I have two t3s in the string: the third and fourth symbols. So that would require two NT3 production rules.\n\nt2 is produced by NT52 (as per `NT52 -> 't2'`).\n\nNow, putting it together, the string is t6 t4 t3 t3 t2.\n\nSo we can think of this as:\n\n1. t6: must come from NT27 \u2192 't6'\n2. t4: must come from NT38 \u2192 't4'\n3. t3: comes from NT3 \u2192 't3'\n4. t3: comes from NT3 \u2192 't3'\n5. t2: comes from NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\nBut in the grammar, we can't have two NTs producing t3 in a row without an intervening production step. Let's try to think about how each symbol is derived.\n\nBut wait, in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, to generate the string, we have to start from S and apply a series of productions, each time expanding a non-terminal into two others or a terminal.\n\nLet me think about S. Looking at the rules, S can be produced by `S -> NT28 NT22`, wait, no, in the given rules: S is `S -> NT28 NT17` (from `S -> NT28 NT17`). Wait, the rules given are:\n\nThe initial S is `S -> NT28 NT17`.\n\nSo S expands into NT28 and NT17, which are both non-terminals.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (rule `NT28 -> NT17 NT7`).\n\nThen, NT17 can produce 't5' (rule `NT17 -> 't5'`), and NT7 can produce, for example, 't3' (as per `NT7 -> NG2 NT19`? Wait, no. Let me look at NT7's productions.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 has several productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NG2 NT19 (multiple times? Let me count the instances.)\n\nWait, actually:\n\nNT7 is produced by several options:\n\n1. `NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19`\n2. `NT7 \u2192 NG2 NT13`\n3. `NT7 \u2192 NG3 NT1`\n4. `NT7 \u2192 NG4 NG9`\n5. `NT7 \u2192 NG18 NG2`\n6. `NT7 \u2192 NG14 NT6`\n7. `NT7 \u2192"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-65","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar and the string are provided, but I'll start by trying to understand what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given with a bunch of production rules. Each production starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left, like S, NT57, NT40, etc., and the right is a combination of other non-terminals and terminals. The terminals seem to be represented by 't' followed by numbers, like t3, t4, etc., and some are actual letters. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, most of them are t followed by numbers, but some of them like 't3' are possibly part of the terminals. However, I notice that the string to evaluate is `t6 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4`. So, all the symbols in the string are 't' followed by numbers, which are likely the terminal symbols.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see rules that have two non-terminals on the right, like S -> NT28 NT17. Then, some production rules have combinations of non-terminals and terminals. For example, looking at NT7, there's a production NT7 -> NT2 NT19, another NT7 -> NT13 NT30, and then there are productions like NT7 -> NT4 NT48 and NT7 -> NT13 NT30. Wait, no, wait\u2014looking back, I think I might have mixed up something. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, upon closer examination, the grammar has both non-terminal and terminal symbols. In the given productions, some of them have a terminal, like NT7 -> 't3'. So, for example, NT7 can produce either a combination of non-terminals or a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the string to evaluate is `t6 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4`. Since each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the process is to see if the string can be generated starting from S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll outline the approach:\n\n1. Understand the structure of the grammar and the possible derivations.\n2. Break the string into parts and see if each part can be generated by the grammar.\n3. Consider the order of derivations and possible intermediate steps.\n\nLet's start by looking at the productions for the non-terminals that might help generate the string. The string starts with 't6', which is the terminal, so the last step before that must have a production that leads to 't6'. Looking at the grammar, NT33 can produce 't3' or 't6' because I see NT33 -> NT55 NT6 and NT33 -> NT56 NT33. Wait, actually, looking again, NT33 has a production to 't6'\u2014let me find it.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that NT6 -> 't4'. Also, NT33 can produce 't3' or 't6' via NT33 -> 't6'.\n\nSo, the string has 't6' as the first symbol, which could come from NT33 -> 't6'.\n\nBut wait, looking more closely, I see NT33 has a production to 't3' or to 't6'? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT33:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT33 -> NT55 NT6\nNT33 -> NT56 NT33\n\nWait, but where is the terminal 't3' coming from? Let me see another production:\n\nLooking through all productions, I see NT3 -> 't3', but that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all productions where a non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given productions, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't3'\n\nNT27 -> 't6'\n\nNT5 -> 't43 NT24'? No, wait, that's a production with non-terminals. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT3 -> 't3' (Wait, is that correct? Let me check: the user provided the grammar, and in it, under NT20, I see 't3', but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me look through the grammar rules provided.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT3, there's a production NT3 -> 't3'\u2014that seems a terminal. Similarly, NT4 -> 't2'. NT5 -> 't43 NT24' seems non-terminal. NT6 appears as the result of NT25 -> 't30 NT54'\u2014no, wait, looking for terminals:\n\nWait, going through the entire grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't3'\n\nNT27 -> 't6'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT3 -> 't3'\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT11 -> 't2'\n\nNT12 -> 't19 NT41'\n\nNT14 -> 't53 NT5'\n\nWT24 -> 't20 NT26'\n\nWait, let me check all the productions to find where terminals are used.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7 can produce 't3' or other combinations.\n- NT27 can produce 't6'.\n- NT5 can produce 't43 NT24' which is non-terminal.\n- NT1 can produce 't58 NT41', non-terminal.\n- NT30 -> 't4'?\nWait, no\u2014looking again, I see that NT30 can produce 't3' or 't4':\n\nWait, no, NT30 has two productions:\n\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30\n\nand\n\nNT30 -> 't4'.\n\nSo, NT30 can produce 't4' directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has a production to 't5'.\n\nLooking at the string `t6 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4`, I need to see if each of these terminals can be produced by non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo, let's map each 't' component:\n\n1. 't6'\u2014this can come from NT27 -> 't6'.\n2. 't4'\u2014could come from NT2 -> 't5'\u2014Wait, no, looking again, NT2 has a production to 't5', but in the string, after 't6', the next symbol is 't4'. So, 't4' would need to come from a production that yields 't4'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT5 -> 't43 NT24', which is non-terminal, so that's not a terminal. Wait, where is the 't4' coming from? Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me find all the terminals:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> 't43 NT24'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT5 -> 't43 NT24'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- Perhaps others?\n\nWait, looking through all the production rules, let's see if there are any other terminal symbols.\n\nNT77: Hmm, perhaps not, but in my initial glance, it seems that 't3', 't4', 't5', 't6' are the terminals.\n\nSo, the string `t6 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4` involves 't0', which isn't a direct terminal in the grammar. Wait, looking back, do any of the non-terminals produce 't0'? Looking at the grammar, I don't recall any production that directly yields 't0'. So that might be a problem because 't0' is part of the string, and unless there's a production that can generate 't0', it's impossible.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, under NT0: there's a production NT0 -> 't5', so 't0' is not a terminal but an actual non-terminal? Wait, no, wait: the grammar uses NT followed by numbers, like NT1, NT2, etc. So 't0' is a terminal symbol. Wait, no, wait, maybe that's a misunderstanding."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-71","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t2 t1 t3 t3 t6 t4` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have rules where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that form, with rules on the left side like S \u2192 NT28 NT17 and each rule on the right side being either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t2 t1 t3 t3 t6 t4`. Since each 't' is a terminal, I need to see if there's a derivation path that, when all non-terminals are replaced, results in exactly this string.\n\nI should start by looking at the top-level rules in the grammar to see which non-terminals can reach the start symbol S. The string starts with 't2', which is a terminal, so I should look at which non-terminals can produce 't2'. Looking at the right-hand sides (RHS) of the rules, I notice that NT28 can produce 't3' (a terminal), and NT52 produces 't2'. So, maybe the start symbol S can be decomposed into something that leads to 't2 t1 t3 t3 t6 t4'.\n\nLooking at the initial rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which is S = NT28 followed by NT17. So, the string should start with NT28 and then NT17. But NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, according to the RHS. So, S starts by producing NT28, which then splits into NT17 and NT7. So the string starts with NT17 followed by NT7.\n\nBut the given string starts with 't2' which is generated by NT52. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Wait, maybe I should think of the entire string as being derived from the start symbol S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let's list out the string components: t2, t1, t3, t3, t6, t4.\n\nI should think about how to break this down into the non-terminals. Let me start looking from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is 't2'. Looking at the grammar, the RHS of 't2' is in NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, and NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36. So 't2' could come from NT52: NT52 \u2192 't2' (from NT52 -> t2 in the last rule, NT52 \u2192 't2'). So, maybe the first non-terminal is NT52.\n\nWait, wait, the rules are on the RHS. Let me look at the RHS for each non-terminal. For example, in the given grammar, NT52 has production NT52 \u2192 't2' (last line: NT52 \u2192 't2'), so NT52 can produce 't2'. Similarly, NT40 \u2192 't3'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n- The line `NT29 -> 't5'` and `NT30 -> 't4'`, then `NT27 -> 't6'`, `NT33 -> 't3'`, `NT4 -> 't2'`. Also, NT52 -> 't2'. So 't2' can come from NT52 or NT4.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't2'. So, perhaps the initial production is NT52 \u2192 't2', and then followed by whatever NT17 is. Wait, but initially, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe I need to build the derivation tree step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string is length 6, so it must come from a derivation that builds up this sequence.\n\nLet me track possible decompositions.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the first step is to have NT28 and NT17.\n\nBut NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so now S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, no: S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nSo, the first two symbols (T2 and T1) would come from NT17 in some way. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT17's rules. The RHS of NT17 includes:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' (a terminal), which is 't5', not 't2' or 't1'. There's also NT17 \u2192 NT46 NT11, but that's for later.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try a different method: using the input string and seeing if it can be built up by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string components with their positions: positions 1 to 6: t2, t1, t3, t3, t6, t4.\n\nI need to see if each token can be generated by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLooking at how 't2' can be generated:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'.\n- Also, NT29 \u2192 't5' (which is t5, not t2), or NT40 \u2192 't3', which is third position in the string.\n\nWait, in the string: first symbol is t2, which comes from NT52. Then, what comes after?\n\nWait, let's try to build the derivation.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nBut NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so now S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t2, which suggests that the first NT28 must produce a t2. Wait, but earlier I thought NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, but in reality, looking at the RHS of NT28, it's \"NT17 NT7\", so in the initial step, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, then NT28 splits into NT17 and NT7. So S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nBut wait, according to the RHS of S: \"S -> NT28 NT17\", so after replacement, S becomes NT28 NT17. Then, when NT28 is replaced, it becomes NT17 NT7. So the entire S production leads to NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nSo the string starts with NT17, then NT7, then NT17.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is 't2', which is from NT52 or NT4.\n\nWait, maybe I confused something. Let me try to find where 't2' comes from.\n\nIn the grammar, the RHS of NT52 is \"t2\", so NT52 can be 't2'. Similarly, NT4's RHS is 't2', as per \"NT4 \u2192 't2'\".\n\nWait, so let me try to map the string:\n\nGiven string: [t2, t1, t3, t3, t6, t4]\n\nSo the first symbol is 't2' \u2192 could be from NT52 or NT4.\n\nLet's suppose the first part is NT52 \u2192 't2'. Then the next symbol is 't1', which is possibly from NT29, since NT29 \u2192 't1'. Or looking at other rules, wait, NT27 \u2192 't6', NT33 \u2192 't3', NT44 \u2192 't17', but maybe I should check which non-terminals can produce 't1'.\n\nLooking at the RHS, 't1' is part of NT38's RHS: NT38 \u2192 't4' 't51'. Also, NT41's RHS is NT45 NT15. But looking through the grammar, oh, I see: NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41, and other rules. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it directly.\n\nWait, let me check each RHS for the terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3' [Wait, no, looking back: NT30's RHS is NT44 NT8. Then looking elsewhere: NT29 has RHS NT5 NT53, which then have terminals. Or perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map all the terminals:\n\nLooking at each non-terminal, find which NTs can produce each terminal:\n\n- 't0' comes from NT0\n- 't1' comes from NT2 (if any? Wait, checking RHS: NT2 doesn't have a terminal a. Wait, let me check all RHS for terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't3'?\nWait, no: looking for a production where the RHS is a terminal.

NT54 has rules like 't3' and others. Hmm, this might get too deep. Let me try another angle.\n\nWait, the grammar is in CNF, so every production is of the form A \u2192 BC. So perhaps each step splits a non-terminal into two others, and the string is built by replacing each non-terminal with its children until all terminal symbols are exhausted.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if the string can be built by a series of such splits.\n\nAlternatively, since it's in CNF, the parse tree for the string will have a structure where the root is S, then two children, each of those two can have two more, and so on, until the string is exhausted.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to start from the string and try to match from the top.\n\nThe string is t4, t1, t4, t0, t5, t3, t0.\n\nLooking for the leftmost symbol, t4. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t4.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 \u2192 't2' is from NT2 \u2192 ..., but NT4's production leads to NT5 and NT36, which are:\n  NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n  NT36 \u2192 't4' (as per NT36 \u2192 't4')\nSo, if NT4 can produce 't2' and then maybe another symbol.\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps NT54 produces 't3' and other terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, let's try to see what the start symbol S can produce. Since S \u2192 NT17 NT28, let's consider that.\n\nSo, the parse tree starts with S, which branches into NT17 and NT28.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 t5, so that's the first symbol, which matches the string's first symbol, t4. Wait, wait\u2014 that doesn't match. Because the string starts with t4, but NT17 produces t5. Hmm, that means I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t4, then coming from NT17 would not be possible, since NT17 only produces 't5'.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So maybe S \u2192 NT17 NT28 is not the correct path.\n\nWait, is there another production that S can make besides NT17 NT28? It's the start symbol, so probably not. So that suggests the string starts with 't5', but our string starts with t4. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the string. Let me check the input.\n\nThe string is \"t4 t1 t4 t0 t5 t3 t0\".\n\nSo the first symbol is t4, which needs to be generated by some rule.\n\nIn that case, I must find a non-terminal that produces t4.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see a few NT rules that can produce 't4'.\n\nNT28 is a non-terminal. Let's see: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, the children of NT28 are NT17 and NT7. If these can produce t4, maybe.\n\nBut earlier, I thought NT28's children are NT17 (t5) and NT7. So how do we get t4 from NT28?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production is S \u2192 NT57 NT7, but looking at the grammar, the first production is S\u2192 NT17 NT28. The other productions are for non-terminals like NT57, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path I'm missing.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully at S's possible productions. The given grammar starts with S\u2192 NT17 NT28, but I don't see any other initial productions. So, S only has one production: S \u2192 NT17 NT28.\n\nThat means, for any string generated by this grammar, the first two non-terminals would be NT17 and NT28. Since we need to produce a string starting with t4, but NT17 produces t5, that's an issue. Therefore, it's impossible for the string starting with t4 to be generated by this grammar, right?\n\nWait, but wait\u2014let me double-check. Is there another way to get t4 as the first symbol? The start symbol must be S, which produces NT17 and NT28. Since NT17 always produces t5, and the first symbol is t4, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but the grammar may have other rules that can be applied in a way that doesn't directly involve S's initial production. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial assumption is wrong, and there's another way to parse the string without starting with S's initial route.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is structured in such a way that it's produced by another starting point. But no, since the start symbol is S, and S only produces NT17 NT28.\n\nHmm. Therefore, it's impossible for the first symbol to be t4, as NT17 gives t5, and the initial production from S only gives NT17."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out whether the given string `t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4` can be generated by the provided Chomsky Normal Form grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has all production rules in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar follows CNF since all left-hand sides are single non-terminals and the right-hand sides are combinations of two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step. Since the string consists of terminals `t2, t0, t1, t4`, I'll need to track how these can be formed by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t2`. I check the productions to see which non-terminals can produce `t2` directly. From the grammar, `NT4 -> 't2'`, `NT6 -> 't4'`, and others produce different terminals. So, NT4 can produce `t2`.\n\nThe string starts with `t2`, which must come from NT4. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, but that's the overall start. Wait, no, actually, the overall start is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, but we need to see how the string is built. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a decision-making process, where at each step, I choose a production rule that matches the current string being built. Since the string is `t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4`, it has 7 symbols. \n\nLet me think of it as a top-down parsing problem where I try to expand S into the string. Since S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which generates a string starting with NT28 and then NT17. So the first part of the string comes from NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28, from the grammar, the rule is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So the first two non-terminals are NT17 and NT7.\n\nBut the first symbol is `t2`, which as I mentioned earlier, comes from NT4. Wait, but here we're dealing with NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, the first part of the string comes from NT17, and the second part from NT7.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me correct this: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so the first two symbols in the string would come from NT17 and NT7. But the string starts with `t2`, which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that directly yields `t2`.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree from the string to see if the root is S.\n\nLet me represent the string as a list: [t2, t0, t1, t0, t4, t0, t4].\n\nSince the start symbol is S, which produces NT28 NT17, the first two symbols should come from NT28 and NT17's expansions.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first symbol (t2) should come from NT28, and the second symbol from NT17? Or am I misunderstanding the order?\n\nWait, actually, in a CFG, the string is built as a sequence of symbols derived from the start symbol and the productions. So S expands into NT28 NT17, which is two symbols, so the first symbol is from NT28, the second from NT17. \n\nBut the string has 7 symbols, which is odd. Each production of a non-terminal can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the length of the string must be even? Wait, not necessarily, because a non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, each of which can produce another non-terminal, leading to more symbols. For example, a single S production can lead to 2, then each of those can lead to 2 more, leading to 4, etc. So the string's length depends on how deeply the productions are expanded.\n\nWait, in this case, the string is 7 symbols, which is odd. So perhaps it's possible because each step can add more non-terminals. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to break down the string into possible constituent parts based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4.\n\nLet's try to parse it starting from the first terminal.\n\nThe first symbol is t2. Which non-terminal can produce t2 directly? From the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT11 \u2192 t2\n- NT0 \u2192 t5, which is a terminal, but that's not applicable here.\n\nSo the possible sources are NT4 or NT11.\n\nLet me try with NT4 first. So the first part, t2, comes from NT4. Then, the rest of the string is t0 t1 t0 t4 t0 t4.\n\nNow, the production for NT4 is NT4 \u2192 't2', so that's a terminal, which takes one symbol, so after that, we need to parse the remaining string starting from the next symbol.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT4 can also produce a combination, but according to the grammar, NT4's productions are:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT4 on the left-hand side. Wait, I might have mixed up NT4 and other productions. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nThe grammar's NT4 is defined as... Wait, I see later rules where other non-terminals produce t's and numbers, but I need to check the production for NT4.\n\nLooking through the productions, line by line:\n\nNT4 isn't explicitly defined, as I see that NT19 produces t3, but wait, in the grammar, NT4 is present in the productions of larger non-terminals. For example, NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make a list of all NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar, the productions are:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT30 NT8\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT0 NT43\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT51 NT27\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT39 NT24\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT5 NT45\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT4 NT54\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT13 NT32\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT52 NT40\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT5 NT53\n\nNT46 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT56 NT33\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT3 NT52\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT41 NT44\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT33 NT2\n\nNT45 \u2192 NT0 NT45\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT21 NT21\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT19 NT48\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT52 NT35\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT21 NT57\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT35\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT39 NT10\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT29 NT13\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT57 NT33\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT46 NT53\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's look at the production for S.\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, S expands into two non-terminals: NT28 and NT17. Now, I need to track what each of these can generate.\n\nLet me list out the productions for NT28 and NT17.\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, NT17 can be replaced by 't3', so when S expands, the second part is 't3', but the first part is NT28 which can further expand into NT17 NT7.\n\nBut wait, NT17 is a terminal or a non-terminal? From the productions, NT17 has a production \u2192 't3' and also \u2192 NT1 NT58, which are non-terminals. So when expanding S, NT28 becomes NT17 NT7, which could go into 't3' and then NT7 and so on.\n\nThis might get complicated. Let me think about how to approach this systematically.\n\nMaybe it's easier to think in reverse. Let's start from the string and see if we can collapse it according to the grammar. Starting from the end symbols, see if they match any production.\n\nLooking at the entire string: t0 t3 t1 t4 t0 t2 t4 t2.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so each must be derived from a single-step production of a non-terminal.\n\nSo, starting from the first token, t0. We look for non-terminals that produce 't0'. Looking through the productions, I see that NT52 \u2192 't2' and NT32 \u2192 't1', but what about 't0'?\n\nWait, let me check all the productions that produce terminals. I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (but not t)\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7 (t0 is 't0'? Wait, in the grammar, do I see any production leading to 't0'?\n\nLooking back, the productions, I see:\n\n- NT13 \u2192 NT17 NT26\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (can't generate t directly here)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41 (no)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n- NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43\n- NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT21 NT21 (from NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT21)\nWait, looking for 't0' as a terminal. Wait, looking at NT3, which is 't3' in one of its productions.\n\nBut wait, looking again: do any non-terminals produce 't0'? Let me check each production for a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT58 \u2192 't1'\n- NT46 \u2192 't1' (from NT46 \u2192 NT13 NT47 which can then go to terminals?)\n- Wait, in the given grammar, each production either goes to another pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, for example, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36, and NT0 and NT36 might produce 't5' and other terminals.\n\nAlternatively, looking for any non-terminal that directly produces 't0' \u2192 't0'.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, does any NT have a production that directly includes 't0'?\n\nLooking at NT0, its productions are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT29 NT54\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT45\n- NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33\n- NT45 \u2192 NT0 NT45\nWait, none of these produce 't0'. So perhaps 't0' is generated indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out all possible productions that could generate t0, t1, etc.\n\nLooking for 't0' in the terminals:\n\nFrom NT3 \u2192 't3' and 't5'.\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\n- NT3: From lines like NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, and NT19 \u2192 't4', NT55 \u2192 NT29 NT54, NT29 \u2192 't5' etc. So perhaps NT3 can generate t5.\n\nBut I'm not seeing an NT that directly produces 't0'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the list:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3' and 't4' (since it can produce 't4' via NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30, and NT15 \u2192 't0')\nWait, so maybe NT30 can lead to 't4', but 't0' comes from NT15.\n\nLooking at line: NT15 \u2192 't0' and also \u2192 NT3 NT7.\n\nSo when can a non-terminal produce 't0'? Only NT15 can directly produce 't0' via NT15 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSimilarly, 't1' is produced by which non-terminals?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (does it lead to 't1'? Maybe through NT17 \u2192 't3' and other paths)\nWait, perhaps 't1' is from NT27 as follows: NT27 can produce NT17 and itself, but NT17 is a terminal, so maybe through another path.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT5:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24. Neither seems to produce a terminal. Hmm, but this isn't leading me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look through all non-terminals and see if any produce 't0' or other required terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the string again: t0 t3 t1 t4 t0 t2 t4 t2.\n\nI need each token to be produced by a single non-terminal, meaning that each token must be a terminal that's a production of some NT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be collapsed step by step by replacing parts of it with NTs until I can see if the whole string can be derived.\n\nLet me try to construct a parse tree. Each step, I pick a part of the string and see if it can be produced by a certain NT.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t3 t1 t4 t0 t2 t4 t2.\n\nFirst token: t0. Which NT produces t0? From the grammar, only NT15 can produce t0 via NT15 \u2192 't0'. So let's see if the entire string can be represented by NT15 followed by other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be derived from S, which is NT28 NT17.\n\nLet's look at S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT17 can be 't3', so that covers the second token. Then NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo that would break the string into t3 t0 t2 ...\n\nWait, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-114","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string `t0 t0 t2 t1 t3 t2 t6 t5` is generated by the given CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. First, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule as either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the format is correct. \n\nThe string given consists of terminals: t0, t1, t2, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nI'll work backwards, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be formed by the given rules. Each step in the derivation should expand the string until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's list out the grammar productions for terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t4 (because in the productions, NT7 can produce NT2 NT19, but wait, no, the terminals are produced by NT7. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I see that some NT symbols directly produce terminals. Wait, looking back, for example, NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 and others, but wait, looking at the bottom of the grammar, I see some entries where NT symbols produce terminals:\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. The grammar has several rules where non-terminals generate terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, at the end, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3' (but NT3 is not an NT; wait, wait\u2014no, looking again:\n\nWait, looking at the end of the provided grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, but NT3 is a non-terminal, right? Wait, no, because in the production rule, if NT3 is an NT, then it wouldn't produce 't3'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I see this part at the end:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nBut wait, 't3' is a terminal. If NT3 is a non-terminal, then that production would mean it can produce 't3'. But in the earlier productions, NT3 appears, for example:\n\nNT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nWait, so NT3 is indeed a non-terminal, but in the end, it's given that NT3 \u2192 't3'. So that's a rule that allows non-terminal NT3 to produce terminal 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4' (since NT6 is not defined, look for production where NT6 \u2192 terminal, I think, but in the grammar, I don't see NT6's production. Wait, looking again, at the end, I only see NT3, NT17, NT27, NT3 producing terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me scan the list again:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to create a list of all terminals and non-terminals. Terminals are the t followed by a number. So t0, t1, t2, etc., are terminals.\n\nNon-terminals are NT followed by a number, like NT57, NT28, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal's productions are either to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to derive is `t0 t0 t2 t1 t3 t2 t6 t5`. That's eight terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step will replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which is NT57.\n\nI think the approach is to consider the string and see if each sequence of terminals can be matched by the productions, working backwards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct the parse tree.\n\nLet me list the string as a list of terminals:\n\nt0, t0, t2, t1, t3, t2, t6, t5.\n\nPerhaps we can think of this as the rightmost derivation.\n\nAnother approach is to use the CYK algorithm to determine if the string is in the language, but since the grammar is small, maybe building a parse tree is feasible.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the top-level production. The start symbol is NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47.\n\nSo NT57 can produce two non-terminals, NT13 and NT47.\n\nSo to derive the string t0 t0 t2 t1 t3 t2 t6 t5, we need to expand NT57.\n\nWait, but NT57 can't directly produce terminals. It must produce non-terminals first.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT13, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n\nBut wait, no, in the grammar, I think I might have misinterpreted NT13.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar includes:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all the NT productions.\n\nLet me list out the NT productions for clarity:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-133","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string `t5 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the process to check the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal. Wait, no\u2014in CNF, left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and right-hand sides have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each production rule looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that most of the rules are transforming NTn into two other NTs. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and so on. At the bottom of the grammar, there are several NT rules that directly correspond to terminals. Let me note these down:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT14 \u2192 't6' (Wait, NT14 is transformed into 't3' via NT54 \u2192 NT14 NT21, then NT54 \u2192 't3', so nt14 indirectly becomes 't3'?\nWait, I think I need to clarify which productions lead to terminals.\n\nWait, wait\u2014the initial problem states that the grammar is in CNF, and possibly all the terminals are represented by single tokens, like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nNow, the string given is `t5 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1`. Let's think of this as a sequence of terminals. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe strategy I can use is to reverse engineer the parsing process. Starting from the beginning of the string, I'll try to build the leftmost derivation.\n\nWait, but in CNF, the process is usually from the top-down, using leftmost derivation. But maybe using a bottom-up approach, like the CYK algorithm could help. Alternatively, I can try to split the string into components that match the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is small, I can manually check possible derivations.\n\nThe string is: T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9\n\nWhich is:\n\nt5, t5, t0, t0, t5, t0, t2, t1, t1\n\nHmm, perhaps I can try to split it into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe first step is to see what the start symbol S can produce. Looking at S's production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo S splits into two non-terminals: NT28 and NT17. Now, NT17 is directly a terminal 't5', so that's helpful.\n\nSo T1 is t5, so corresponds to NT17 \u2192 't5'. Then, after NT17, we have NT28.\n\nSo the next part should be NT28 \u2192 'something', which should produce the rest of the string after t5.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 is 't5', and NT7 can be further split.\n\nNT7 has two productions: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 and NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30.\n\nSo for NT7, it branches into two options. Let's see how the string fits.\n\nAfter t5 (NT17), we have t5, t0, t0, etc. Wait, perhaps I should see if the entire string can be split as per the grammar's structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the possible parts that can generate the string. Let's consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals and see how they can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe string is t5 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1.\n\nLet me think about the structure:\n\nThe string starts with t5, which is produced by NT17. So the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nThen NT17 is 't5'.\n\nNow, after that, we have to generate the rest: t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1.\n\nThis should come from NT28. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So after NT17 ('t5'), we have to get t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1 from NT7.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because NT7 would produce two parts, but the string after t5 has nine elements. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no: S is NT28 NT17._NT28 produces NT17 NT7. NT17 is t5, so after that, we get t5 (from NT17) and then the rest comes from NT7.\n\nSo the string after the initial S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is t5 followed by what comes from NT7. But in the given string, after the initial t5, we have t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1. So the part from NT7 must produce t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1.\n\nWait, that's eight terminals. Let me see: S splits into NT28 (producing ...) and NT17 (producing t5). But the initial t5 is from NT17, so the rest of the string is t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1, which is produced by NT28.\n\nHmm, no. Wait, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So NT28 produces some terminals and then NT17 produces t5. So the entire string is [NT28's output] followed by [t5].\n\nBut the given string is t5 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1. So the first t5 comes from NT17, and then after that comes t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1. So the remainder has to be generated by NT28.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 is t5, and NT7 must produce t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1.\n\nWait, but NT7 splits into two parts. Let's think about the string after the initial two t5's.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the string as starting with two t5's. Hmm, but the string starts with a single t5.\n\nWait, no\u2014the string is t5 t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1. So position 1: t5 (from NT17), position 2: t5 (maybe from another NT17?), but looking at the grammar, NT17 only splits into NT28, which is the same as S, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions split. Perhaps after the first t5, the rest is generated by NT28, which branches into NT17 NT7.\n\nSo the rest of the string after that is t5 t0 t0 t5 t0 t2 t1 t1. So, that's eight symbols.\n\nBut NT7's production can split into two parts, each producing a sequence of terminals. Let me see:\n\nNT7's possible productions are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\n\nSo, for each branch, we can explore both options.\n\nFirst branch: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19.\n\nNT2 is a terminal 't5', as per the bottom of the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back at the bottom rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (since a bunch of NTs and rules eventually lead to it being a terminal).\n\nWait, actually, looking at the bottom, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, in the branch NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, NT2 is 't5' and NT19 \u2192 't0'.\n\nBecause looking at the bottom, I see NT19 \u2192 't0'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT19 is directly a terminal 't0'.\n\nWait, no\u2014looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, no: at the bottom of the given grammar, it says:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, yes, NT5 \u2192 't0', but NT19 isn't directly listed. Wait, no\u2014I think I might be confused. Let me list all the terminal productions at the bottom:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-130","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string given is \"t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t6 t1 t5 t2\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So every production is in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S can produce two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. \n\nEach of these non-terminals will have their own productions. Let me write out the relevant productions for NT28 and NT17 to see where they lead.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nSo starting from S, we go NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, then NT17 splits into NT1 and NT58, and NT7 can have multiple productions. I'll need to see which path leads to the string.\n\nThe string in question is \"t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t6 t1 t5 t2\". Each token is a terminal, so I need to find a way that the non-terminals can expand to these tokens. \n\nLet's look at NT28's production: it becomes NT17 and NT7. NT17 is NT1 and NT58. \n\nNT1's production: I don't see NT1 defined in the provided grammar, so maybe it's not there. Wait, maybe I misread. Let's check the grammar again. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see that many non-terminals expand into pairs of other non-terminals. It's a big grammar, so I'll need to find a path from S to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by seeing where the terminals appear in the grammar. Let's go through the rules that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT36 \u2192 't5' (only)\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (multiple times)\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't3'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT23 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT14 \u2192 't2' (multiple times)\n- NT40 \u2192 't4' (multiple times via different paths)\n- NT24 \u2192 't1'\n- NT54 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT51 \u2192 't1'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT58 \u2192 't1'\n\nSo each terminal appears in specific productions. I need to find a way to get the given string by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet's try to trace the string step by step. The string starts with t2. Looking at the grammar, t2 appears as NT4 \u2192 't2'. So somewhere in the derivation, NT4 must expand to 't2'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. Since NT36 \u2192 't5', the expansion would be NT4 \u2192 't2' t5, but the string starts with t2, so perhaps NT4 is the first part. But looking at the grammar, NT4 has to expand into two non-terminals, so I can't directly get a single 't2'. Therefore, perhaps the initial expansion needs to go through other non-terminals that eventually expand into 't2'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with a longer expansion, so let's see how S can produce.\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So far, we have NT1 NT58 NT7.\n\nNow, let's see how NT1 is derived. Checking the grammar, I don't see a production for NT1. That's a problem because if NT1 isn't defined, it can't expand further. So maybe I made a mistake earlier or there's another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should track the string and see where the non-terminals can expand.\n\nLooking at the string \"t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t6 t1 t5 t2\", let's break it into individual terminals: t2, t0, t5, t2, t5, t6, t1, t5, t2.\n\nWe need to find a way for the grammar to produce these in order.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo now we have NT1 NT58 NT7. But NT1 is undefined, so that's a problem unless NT1 can reach another non-terminal that can produce 't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path for NT28. Let me check the productions for NT28: it appears only once, as NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So there's no alternative for NT28.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nThen NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, which we can't expand further. So maybe we're stuck here. That suggests that maybe the string can't be derived, but that can't be right because the problem is asking us to determine if it's generated, so perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, perhaps NT1 is being used in a different context. Let me check the productions again for NT1. Oh, here it is: Looking through, I don't see NT1 defined. So perhaps that's a typo, but I think the grammar is correct as provided. So if NT1 isn't defined, it's not part of the grammar, so that path can't lead anywhere.\n\nThat's a problem because that would imply that the derivation can't proceed beyond S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and since NT7 can expand into 't5' or other non-terminals, maybe the string can't be formed because the initial part starts with t2.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Maybe the expansion isn't straightforward. Let's consider the first token in the string is t2. Looking at the grammar, t2 appears in NT4 \u2192 't2', but NT4 also has to expand into NT5 and NT36. So to get 't2' at the beginning, there must be a way for a non-terminal that can directly produce 't2' to be the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 t0 t5 t2 t5 t6 t1 t5 t2. It starts with t2, so perhaps one of the non-terminals needs to expand into 't2' as the first symbol. Let's see where 't2' appears as an expansion.\n\nIn the grammar, 't2' is used as a result of NT4 \u2192 't2' (since NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 and NT36 \u2192 't5'), but NT4 as a single symbol isn't present anywhere else. So the only way to get 't2' is through NT4. So S must expand to something that eventually leads to NT4 producing 't2'.\n\nBut S starts as NT28 and NT17. Let's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT7 can have several expansions: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19; NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30; NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48; NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT26; etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the first 't2' comes from a long chain of expansions. Let me try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nFrom S, we go to NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Oh, but NT1 is not defined. So that can't proceed. So perhaps S can't produce the string because it can't start with 't2'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another path for NT28 that I'm missing. Let me check NT28's productions. Only one: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So no alternative.\n\nTherefore, from S, we get NT28 and NT17. NT17 can't expand beyond NT1 and NT58, which are undefined. So the only way the string can start with t2 is if one of the non-terminals in the expansion can produce 't2' as the first symbol.\n\nBut according to the grammar, the only way to get 't2' is through NT4 \u2192 't2', which is a single terminal. But NT4 doesn't appear in the start symbol or S's expansion steps because S only expands into NT28 and NT17. So unless there's a production that allows NT28 or NT17 to produce something that leads to NT4, which can produce '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-151","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string \"t3 t0 t3 t1 t0 t3 t5 t1 t1 t2\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to understand its structure. The grammar consists of non-terminals (NT) and the terminals, which in this case are symbols like t0, t1, t2, etc. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe production rules are all in the form NT -> NT NT or NT -> terminal. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each rule has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Since the target string is made up of terminals, the derivation will replace non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet's write down the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar. The string is: t3 t0 t3 t1 t0 t3 t5 t1 t1 t2.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the derivation must start with NT28 and NT17, each of which must produce the first two parts of the string or something that leads to them.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since the string is a concatenation of terminals, each production step must replace a non-terminal with a sequence that eventually leads to the entire string. So the leftmost non-terminal must generate the first part, and so on.\n\nBut since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. So the derivation tree will be a binary tree leading down to the terminals.\n\nMaybe it's easier to see if the string can be parsed using the grammar. Let's see if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the string step by step, starting from S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first steps are generating the string starting with NT28 and NT17.\n\nThe string starts with t3. So let's trace where t3 comes from. Looking through the grammar, t3 is a terminal symbol. Let's see which rules produce t3:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, t3 is produced by several NTs:\n\n- NT3 -> 't3' (NT3 \u2192 t3)\n- NT33 \u2192 't3' (NT33 \u2192 t3)\n- NT4 \u2192 't2' (so this doesn't produce t3)\n- NT11 -> ... (but looking, NT11 \u2192 NT26 ... not producing t3)\n- NT27 \u2192 't6' (no)\nWait, sorry, looking at the rules, there's NT17 \u2192 t5, NT27 \u2192 t6, but t3 is produced by NT3 and NT33.\n\nSo for example, NT3 \u2192 t3, so t3 could come from NT3.\n\nBut let's look at the tree. Since S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and the first part of the string is t3, probably NG28 must produce t3, and NT17 must produce something else.\n\nWait, let me think. The start is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first part is built by NT28, and the second by NT17. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each non-terminal must be replaced accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to factor the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet's see. The string is t3 t0 t3 t1 t0 t3 t5 t1 t1 t2.\n\nThat's a bit complex. Let's consider breaking it down.\n\nFirst, notice that NT28 and NT17 must produce the first and second parts, respectively. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17. The first token is t3, so perhaps NT28 \u2192 t3, and NT17 must produce the rest starting with t0.\n\nBut wait, NT28's production rules are:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (multiple options, looking back)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at NT28, I think it has multiple rules. In the given grammar, let me check:\n\n- NT28 -> NT44 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- Other rules... no, that's it. So NT28 can produce either NT44 NT13 or NT17 NT7.\n\nSo if S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and the first part is t3, then perhaps NT28 is being used to generate the initial t3.\n\nSo, let's say NT28 \u2192 something that starts with t3. If NT28 can go to NT17 NT7, then maybe NT17 produces t3. Wait, but S is NT28 NT17, so if NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, then S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to start from the string and try to parse it using the grammar.\n\nEach part of the string can be considered as a sequence of terminals, and the grammar will have to cover that sequence.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t3 t0 t3 t1 t0 t3 t5 t1 t1 t2.\n\nStarting with t3, which could come from NT3 or NT33.\n\nLet's tentatively assign t3 as the first part.\n\nSo, let's see how NT3 is used. NT3's production rules include a rule that produces t3 (as I saw, NT3 \u2192 t3), and potentially other rules.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT3 can produce t3 and also t5.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part is NT3 \u2192 t3.\n\nNow, what's the next part of the string: after t3, the next is t0. So after t3, we have t0.\n\nBut in the grammar, t0 is produced by which NTs? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t1 t5 (from the rules, looking at NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 t0 )\nNot sure. Wait, looking through the grammar, maybe I should check where t0 appears.\n\nBut actually, looking for where t0 is a terminal: it's only in the productions of NT15, NT23, etc. For example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t0 NT... etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, no direct t0. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, on checking the given grammar, perhaps I missed that \"t0\" is a terminal, but looking through all the production rules, it seems that t0 is produced by some NT. Or perhaps I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, looking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking for any rule where a non-terminal produces t0. Hmm, this might indicate that t0 is not a terminal but a non-terminal, and somewhere it's the result of a production.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Because in the string provided, the terminals are t3, t0, t3, etc., but perhaps t0 is a terminal, but in the grammar, maybe it's being derived from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify which symbols are terminals and which are non-terminals. The problem statement says that the string may or may not be generated by the grammar. So, in this context, the string is a sequence of terminals (t0, t1, etc.) and the grammar's productions consist of non-terminals (NT followed by numbers) and terminals perhaps. Wait, no, in the grammar given, it's all either non-terminals (NT followed by digits) or symbols like t3, t0, etc. That suggests that t0, t1, etc., are terminals because they appear on the right-hand side as terminals (not as non-terminals). So in the given grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13, which are non-terminals, whereas NT28 \u2192 t3 is a production where a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nSo t0, t1, etc., are terminals of this grammar.\n\nSo in the string, \"t0\" is a terminal.\n\nNow, back to the initial parsing. After the initial t3 (from NT3 \u2192 t3), what's next? The next token is t0.\n\nSo we have to see if, after the first NT3, which is generating t3, the next part is the t0.\n\nBut in a context-free grammar, the derivation is a single sequence of substitutions, so I think the initial S \u2192 NT28 NT17 goes on, and each non-terminal is replaced step by step until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo perhaps each non-terminal in the derivation must ultimately expand into the string.\n\nSo maybe the parsing needs to be a tree where the root is S, with left child NT28 and right child NT17. Each of these will produce a substring, and together their concatenation should form the original string.\n\nSo we have to see if NT28 can produce \"t3 ... \" and NT17 can produce \"t0 ...\".\n\nBut perhaps this method is a bit vague."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, more accurately, looking at the grammar, I think NT15 -> 't0' directly.\n- Others seem to terminate in t's, but checking if any replace t0, t1, etc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there's NT54 -> 't3' and NT16 (if any) but let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT5 -> ... -> 't5' (since NT56 -> 't3', NT45 -> 't45'... no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list each non-terminal and their possible productions ending with t's.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT7: has productions, one of them is NT7 -> 't3' and another is NT7 -> NT13 NT30, which might further reduce to t3...

Maybe a better approach is to try to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the string `t0 t4 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0 t6 t3 t2`. Let me check each part.\n\nI know S -> NT28 NT17. So the initial reduction would be S becomes NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 -> NT17 NT7 (since one of its productions is NT28 -> NT17 NT7). That would mean the first part is NT28, which splits into NT17 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT17: in the productions, NT17 -> 't5', so that would produce the terminal 't5', which is the last token in the string except for 't2' somewhere else. Wait, in the string, the last token is 't2'. So perhaps I'm not matching correctly.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe string is: t0 t4 t3 t4 t1 t4 t0 t6 t3 t2.\n\nI'll try to match each symbol starting from the end to see if I can reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nThe last symbol is 't2'. Let me look for a production that ends with 't2' as the last step.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT7 -> 't3' or NT7 -> NT13 NT30. Also, NT27 -> NT4 NT3 and NT27 -> 't6'. Similarly, NT12 -> NT29 NT13 and others.\n\nWait, I think I'm going to need a different approach. Perhaps using the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nBut the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the CYK algorithm requires that each production is of two non-terminals. Let me check the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals except for those that terminate in 't's.\n\nWait, no. The grammar might have both A -> BC and A -> a, where a is a terminal. No, in Chomsky normal form (CNF), it's either A->BC or A->a. But the given grammar seems to have only A->BC, except the bottom-level productions which may have things like NT17 -> 't3'.\n\nSo, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nYes, I think that's the case here. So, to generate the string, every step in the derivation must consume exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal).\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a single terminal. So each step consumes exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or one terminal and nothing else.\n\nBut the string is all terminals, so every production used in the derivation must consume exactly two symbols.\n\nWait, no. Each production in CNF can either produce two non-terminals (thus requiring two symbols for their expansion) or a single terminal. So to generate a string with all terminals, each production must eventually lead to a terminal after a series of steps.\n\nI think that's correct. So the process involves breaking down each part into two symbols at each step until only terminals remain.\n\nThe given string has 10 symbols, which is even? Wait, 10 is an even number, but in CNF derivations, the length of the string is 2^n, starting from S which maybe leads to two non-terminals. Hmm, but our string is length 10, which is 2*5, but 5 isn't a power of two. Wait, wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production produces two symbols. So starting from S, which produces two non-terminals, each step processes those two non-terminals, possibly replacing each with two symbols, so the length doubles each time.

{"custom_id":"request-170","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's in the language defined by this grammar. The string to evaluate is `t2 t6 t4 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t4`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form consists of production rules where each non-terminal symbol expands into two other non-terminals, or one terminal. In this case, the string seems to consist entirely of terminal symbols, which are things like 't2', 't3', etc. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that many of the productions are rules where one non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals, and some produce terminal symbols. For example, rules like S -> NT28 NT17 or NT7 -> 't3' (I assume this refers to the terminal 't3' since 'NT7' is a non-terminal). \n\nSo, the task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to figure out a way to break it down using the given productions.\n\nI should start by examining the structure of the grammar and see how the terminals can be generated. The string has the form t2 t6 t4 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t4. Since this is a sequence of productions, I have to see if it can be split into pairs that match the non-terminal productions.\n\nOne approach is to try to parse the string from the top down, starting from S and expanding it step by step. Alternatively, I could try to split the string into parts that correspond to the left-hand sides of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT5 -> NT43 NT24, which might eventually produce 't2'\n- NT52 -> NT20 NT36, which might eventually lead to 't2' and 't5' (assuming NT20 and NT36 produce those)\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n\nSo, the string starts with t2, then t6, t4, t5, etc. I need to see if each part can be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to first list all the non-terminals and the terminal strings they can produce. For example, some non-terminals like NT52 and NT3 might produce terminal sequences directly or through other steps.\n\nLet me try to build a mapping from some non-terminals to their terminal sequences:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (from NT7 -> 't3')\n- NT4 \u2192 't2' (since NT4 -> NT5 NT36, and NT53 -> NT12 NT23, but this seems complicated; perhaps I should look at any terminals.)\n- Wait, looking back, NT48 -> NT1 NT23, and from the given rules, perhaps I can trace until I get a terminal.\n\nThis might be getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to represent the grammar's rewrite rules as a tree where each non-terminal can be replaced by two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step, applying the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t2 t6 t4 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t4.\n\nLet me split this string into smaller chunks that might correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, the string has 11 elements. Since each production (except S) is two non-terminals (nt), perhaps the derivation tree can be built recursively.\n\nBut let's think about the structure. Maybe the entire string can be built by starting from S and expanding it.\n\nS starts as NT28 NT17. Let's see where these go.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n\nSo, S expands to NT28 NT17, which becomes NT17 NT7 NT17 (since NT28 -> NT17 NT7) and then NT17 -> 't5', so it's t5 NT7 't5' (since NT17 becomes t5 and NT7 becomes 't3', or more accurately, each NT17 and NT7 would be expanded recursively).\n\nWait, perhaps S can be expanded as:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 (t5 NT7) t5 \u2192 t5 t3 t5 (since NT7 \u2192 't3').\n\nBut wait, this gives t5 t3 t5, which is three terminal symbols. The string I have is longer, so maybe I need a deeper expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for longer chains. Let me check the grammar rules for NT28 and NT17.\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, combining: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 t5 't3' \u2192 \"t5 t3\".\n\nSo, S \u2192 t5 t3. But the string starts with t2, which is different. So perhaps this isn't the correct path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake because S is NT28 NT17. Let me see what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT28: the rule is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 can produce two other non-terminals: NT17 and NT7.\n\nEach of these, when expanded, results in some terminals and\/or non-terminals.\n\nAs before:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo NT28 \u2192 't5' 't3' \u2192 the string starting with t5 t3. But the given string starts with t2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's another rule that I haven't considered.\n\nWait, let's check other non-terminals. Maybe S can expand into different paths.\n\nWait, no, from the grammar, S is only defined as NT28 NT17, which we've already determined. So S -> NT28 NT17 -> (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 expanding NT17 on the left and right, but each NT17 is 't5' and NT7 is 't3'. So it's 't5' 't3' 't5'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', which doesn't match 't5'.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for a different approach. Maybe the initial expansion was wrong because perhaps I should consider that NT28 can also expand into more non-terminals, not just NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, I'll check all rules that start with NT28:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nThat's the only rule where NT28 is the LHS. So S is NT28 NT17, which in turn is NT17 NT7 NT17 \u2192 but each NT17 and NT7 can expand into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps this S can only generate a string of two terminals? Or perhaps not. Let me think about this again.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the production. S is NT28 NT17. When expanding S, it's replacing each of these. But since both are non-terminals, they can be further expanded. Let me try.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, so far, S \u2192 (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 each NT17 is 't5', and NT7 is 't3' \u2192 which gives 't5 t3 t5'.\n\nSo S would produce a string of three terminals: 't5 t3 t5'.\n\nBut the given string is 't2 t6 t4 t5 t3 t3 t6 t5 t3 t2 t4' which is 11 symbols. So clearly, this suggests that the initial S expansion only gives three symbols, which is shorter than 11. Therefore, either the initial assumption is wrong, or perhaps the expansion is more complex.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I've made a mistake in how the productions are structured. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which for each production rule, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. But sometimes, in practice, the right-hand side can be a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar provided, I see some rules where non-terminals are on both sides, like NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14, etc. So all these are of the form two non-terminals on the right.\n\nBut for terminals, I need to see if any non-terminal rules produce a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-186","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the string `t1 t5 t6 t5 t3 t6 t3 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, so the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the initial symbol which can derive a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some of the production rules directly map to terminals. For example, rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17 eventually leads to a terminal. Also, some rules for non-terminals have one or two non-terminals on the right side, but I have to make sure that in the CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 B or A \u2192 BC. But in this grammar, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (if it's a unit production). But looking at the rules, I don't see any unit productions; all are either two non-terminals or perhaps a terminal. For example, NT17 \u2192 't3' is a production.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the productions can have terminals, which is fine. So in this grammar, each non-terminal on the left side is producing either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So when a non-terminal is expanded, it could result in a combination of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is `t1 t5 t6 t5 t3 t6 t3 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4`. This is a sequence of terminals, so to check if the grammar can generate this, I need to see if starting from the start symbol S, I can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nThe string starts with t1, which is a terminal. Let's look at the grammar to see where t1 can come from. From the end-of-rule list, I see that NT27 \u2192 't6' and NT7 \u2192 't3', among others. Wait, let me scan through all the rules for terminals.\n\nLooking at the list, some non-terminals expand to terminals:\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0' (again)\n- NT33 \u2192 't3' and 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- etc. Actually, upon more careful examination, some non-terminals have multiple ways to reach terminals.\n\nWait, but in the list I see NT27 \u2192 't6' and also NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27. That seems confusing. So, for NT27, it can either produce 't6' or be split into NT17 and itself, which would produce a recursive structure.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if the string can be broken down into the terminals as generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree for the string or use the pumping lemma or dynamic programming to check for derivations. But considering the string length is 12, it's manageable.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t1 t5 t6 t5 t3 t6 t3 t5 t3 t4 t4 t4.\n\nLooking at the end, there are three t4's at the end: t4 t4 t4. So perhaps the last part of the string is derived from a production that generates these t4's.\n\nLooking back at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't2', and perhaps a production that leads to NT4. Wait, let's see: NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT21. Does NT14 or NT21 lead to t4? Looking further, NT14's production is NT53 NT5, but I don't see t4 there. Wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for each non-terminal. For example:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT33 NT2, which might lead to t2's.\n- NT39 \u2192 NT39 NT10, which might lead to more.\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, where NT23 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo, if NT43 \u2192 NT14 NT20, and NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21, which could lead to more complex structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last three t4's come from NT4 repeated three times. But NT4 \u2192 't2', so that's unlikely. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the string t4 t4 t4 comes from a rule that has three t4's. But in the grammar, I don't see any rule that expands a non-terminal into three terminals, but in some cases, non-terminals can lead to a combination that results in multiple terminals in the string.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the end of the string is from a chain of non-terminals expanding into multiple t4's through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the t4's come from the start symbol expanding into components that eventually result in t4's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t1. From the grammar, I can see that NT27 can produce t6, and NT32 can produce t1. So, if the first symbol is t1, perhaps it comes from NT32.\n\nSo, the string starts with t1, which is from NT32 \u2192 t1. That's clear.\n\nSo, the first part is NT32 \u2192 t1.\n\nThen, the next part is t5. So, after NT32, we have t5. So, we need NT32 to split into t1 and something else that can produce t5. But wait, NT32 is a single non-terminal. So, after producing t1, what is the next symbol? If NT32 \u2192 t1 followed by t5, but NT32 is a single symbol, perhaps it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is a result of replacing S step by step. Alternatively, perhaps the production S breaks down into two non-terminals, each of which eventually produce parts of the string.\n\nLet me look at S's rule: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S breaks into NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo, let's think S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33.\n\nThen, NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5.\n\nNT5 is a non-terminal. Similarly, NT33 can be broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to track the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree bottom-up.\n\nWait, another approach: The string has t1 as the first symbol. Looking at the possible productions that result in t1:\n\nIn the grammar, NT32 \u2192 t1.\n\nSo, in the parse tree, the starting non-terminal S must somehow lead to NT32. Or, S's productions must include NT32 in the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at S's productions: S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and other possible top-level rules? Wait, no, S's only rule is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, S must derive into two parts: the first part is NT28, which then must produce the beginning of the string.\n\nIf the string starts with t1, then NT28 must somehow derive into t1 followed by other symbols. Wait, no, because NT28 is a single non-terminal, so perhaps in the parse tree, the first part is derived into t1 and the second part is derived into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try a different approach: tracing the string from the end.\n\nThe string ends with t4 t4 t4. Let's see which non-terminals can produce three t4's. Looking at the rules, none of them seem to produce three terminals directly, but perhaps multiple steps.\n\nWait, for example, let's look at NT43: NT43 \u2192 NT14 NT20.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24.\n\nWait, this seems recursive. Maybe NT43 eventually leads to multiple t4's.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, and NT23 \u2192 't4'. So, if NT48 can produce t4, then perhaps a chain can lead to multiple t4s.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a way to get three t4's at the end, perhaps the last part is derived from a non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-194","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string given is \"t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t2 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1 t0\". \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar consists of a start symbol and production rules that expand non-terminal symbols into other symbols. The string being in the language means it can be derived starting from the start symbol by expanding non-terminals according to the rules.\n\nThe grammar here is given with several production rules. Each production is either of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> 't', where NT represents non-terminals that are part of the grammar, and 't' is a terminal symbol.\n\nMy task is to see if the string \"t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t2 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1 t0\" can be generated by this grammar. Since the string ends with a sequence of t symbols, I think each of these must correspond to a production rule that directly gives a terminal.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that have terminals as their right-hand side to see how they can be used:\n\n- NT2 -> 't5' (from S's production, but S is the start symbol and is non-terminal)\n- Wait, actually, looking back, the right-hand sides are other non-terminals except for some that produce 't's. So I need to look for any rule where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through the list, I see at the end:\n\n- NT36 -> 't5'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT20 -> 't4'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't5', which refers to NT17's production as given.\n- Others have 't0', 't1', etc., but I think NT54 -> 't3' and others, but need to check all.\n\nWait, looking at the very end of the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\nNT27 -> 't6'\nNT3 -> 't3'\n\nAh, so for example, NT3 can directly produce 't3', NT27 can produce 't6', and so on. So for the given string, each 't' in the sequence must correspond to some terminal of these non-terminals expanding directly.\n\nSo let's break down the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t4 t0 t3 t0 t5 t2 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1 t0\n\nWe can think of each token as needing to be generated directly by a rule that ends with a terminal symbol.\n\nBut how does this fit with the grammar? Because the start symbol is S, and it has a production S -> NT28 NT17.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it consists of these terminals: t5, t3, t1, etc. The grammar also has non-terminals like S, NT57, NT5, and others.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to reverse-engineer the string, starting from the leftmost symbol and trying to build the structure that could generate it. This is often called the leftmost derivation or parse.\n\nLet me list the string in order:\n\n1. t5\n2. t3\n3. t1\n4. t1\n5. t6\n6. t3\n7. t5\n8. t4\n9. t3\n10. t1\n11. t0\n12. t2\n13. t3\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals can produce the first symbol, t5. Looking at the productions, I see that NT5, NT7, and NT54, etc., all can produce t5 or other symbols. Wait, the productions that produce terminals are the leaves. So, let me check all the non-terminals to see which ones have a production that leads to 't5' as their leftmost symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT47 \u2192 NT27 NT11 (this is a non-terminal production, not terminal)\nWait, no. The productions that produce terminals are the ones where the right-hand side is a terminal. Wait, no, the non-terminals produce other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that end with terminals. For example, NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51, and NT8 is a terminal 't4', but NT51 can be further broken down.\n\nBut to get t5, I need to find a non-terminal that can derive t5 on the left. Looking through, for example:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. Does this produce t5? Wait, in the terminal definitions, NT58's productions might lead to t5. Wait, no, the productions are either to other non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, NT58 has a production NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, which is non-terminal, but NT17, which does produce 't5'. Wait, actually, in the given terminal definitions, some symbols are actually terminals, like NT4's production is 't2', and others.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nFrom the given grammar rules, let me scan for rules where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT48 NT21: non-terminal\nNT47 \u2192 NT57 NT33: non-terminal\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding since the rules are all in CNF, which uses two non-terminals. So, perhaps the only terminal outputs are in the S rules, or in the other non-terminals' productions.\n\nWait, the provided rules are all in CNF, meaning each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Wait no, wait CNF is left-hand side is a single non-terminal and right-hand side is two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking through, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT2 (non-terminals)\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals are like NT3 \u2192 t3, as seen at the end:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 \u2192 t3?\n\nWait, looking at the very end of the given rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t3 (in the last line) and similarly for NT6 \u2192 t4, NT9 \u2192 t3, NT15 \u2192 t0, etc.\n\nWait no, actually, no. The grammar's productions are all with non-terminals on the right, or ending with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the rules more carefully. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 \u2192 non-terminals. But some non-terminals have productions that are a single terminal, like NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nYes, looking back, in the given rules, several non-terminals have productions leading to a single terminal:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT38 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT36 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, let me note these:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT15 \u2192 t0\n- NT21 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t5\n\nYes, these are the non-terminals that can directly generate a terminal symbol.\n\nSo, to start parsing the string from the left, the first symbol is t5. So, I need a non-terminal that can generate t5.\n\nFrom the list above, NT17 and NT36 can produce t5.\n\nSo, possible options for the first step: either NT17 or NT36.\n\nI'll choose one, then proceed.\n\nLet me try NT17 \u2192 t5 first.\n\nIf the first symbol is t5, then the production would be S \u2192 NT28 NT2 \u2192 wait, no.

Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, initially, looking at the grammar, the first line is S -> NT28 NT28. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe grammar as given starts with S -> NT28 NT28, but upon closer inspection, the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT28 NT228\"?\n\nWait, the user wrote: S -> NT28 NT28? Wait no, let me check:\n\nLooking back: the user wrote:\n\n\"Grammar: S -> NT28 NT28\n\nWait no, actually, the user wrote:\n\n\" S-> NT28 NT28\"\n\nYes, the initial grammar seems to be:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nWait, in the beginning, the user stated:\n\n\" S -> NT28 NT28\"\n\nNo, wait the user's first line is:\n\n\" S -> NT28 NT28\"\n\nWait no, I think the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT28 NT17\"\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\n\"S -> NT28 NT28\"\n\nWait no, here's the user's first line:\n\n\"Grammar: ```S -> NT28 NT28```\"\n\nWait, let me parse the user's provided grammar carefully.

Hmm, that's a bit of a puzzle, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar to see how it produces terminals and non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived by starting from the start symbol and applying these productions until I end up with the target string.\n\nThe start symbol here is S, which has the production S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S must somehow generate the given string. Let's check NT28 and NT17 to see what they produce.\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Hmm, but then NT7 has several productions: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, etc. Also, NT17 eventually leads to 't5' in some cases, like NT17 \u2192 't5' directly, but wait, actually looking again, the string ends with several 't4's and 't5's, so maybe some of these non-terminals produce these terminals directly.\n\nWait, maybe I should map out the derivation path step by step. Let's consider breaking down the string into parts.\n\nThe string is: t6, t2, t0, t2, t5, t4, t2, t0, t4, t6, t5, t4, t4.\n\nSince it's a leftmost derivation, I should start with S \u2192 NT28 NT17, then expand NT28 and NT17 as much as possible, and see if the resulting string matches.\n\nLet me try to expand NT28 first. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Wait, but NT17 is another non-terminal. So, expanding NT17 might involve more steps.\n\nWait, let's see NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 't5'. But in the given string, the first symbol is 't6', not 't5'. So, perhaps there's an error in my initial approach. Maybe NT28 can expand in another way that leads to 't6' at the beginning.\n\nLooking back, NT28's production is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So when I expand NT28, I get NT17 (which might produce a terminal) followed by NT7, which might also produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, but according to the given string, the first symbol is 't6'. Let's see if any of the expansions of NT28 or NT17 can produce 't6'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't3', but that leads to 't3', which is not 't6'. NT38 \u2192 't4', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Maybe some non-terminal directly expands to 't6'.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last symbol is 't4', but let's check if any production ends with 't6'. Wait, I don't see any NT producing 't6' directly in the terminals. So perhaps 't6' comes from a production of a non-terminal that somehow leads back to another step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree from the target string in reverse.\n\nThe target string is 13 symbols long, so let's see if we can split it into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most non-terminals split into two parts. So maybe the string can be split into sequences where each split corresponds to a production.\n\nThe last symbol is 't4', which could be the result of a production ending with 't4'. But wait, looking at NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44, and NT48 \u2192 NT52 NT14, etc. Maybe a production like NT32 \u2192 NT46 NT1, where NT46 is a non-terminal that produces something ending with 't4'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should map out the possible productions that could produce these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a path in the grammar that starts with S and leads to the given string.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So S can become NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. Maybe I should expand NT28 and NT17 in a way that the terminals are formed.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for NTs that can produce 't6'.\n\nWait, maybe NT38 \u2192 't4', and NT31 is involved elsewhere, but I don't see an NT directly producing 't6'. So perhaps I need to find an NT that can produce 't6' indirectly through other productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too complex, and a better approach is to count the number of symbols. The string has 13 symbols, so in terms of the grammar, each step could potentially generate two symbols (since most productions are A \u2192 BC), except for those that produce terminals.\n\nWait, but let's count the depth. Starting from S, which is 1 symbol, each expansion branches the string. The string has 13 symbols, so to get to 13, the depth would be such that 2^depth is greater than 13. Let's see:\n\nAfter 1 step: 2 symbols.\n\nAfter 2 steps: 4 symbols.\n\nAfter 3: 8.\n\nAfter 4: 16. But the string is 13, so perhaps it's a mix of some parts branching and others not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by a series of substitutions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals until eventually, certain ones produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the string backward, as sometimes this is easier.\n\nLooking at the last symbol: 't4'. Let's see which NTs can produce 't4'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36. Hmm, but 't4' as a terminal isn't there. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that can produce 't4'. Looking at the final productions, I see:\n\n- NT52 -> NT20 NT36\n- NT41 -> NT45 NT15\n- NT38 -> 't4' ?\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see directly any NT producing 't4' as a terminal. Oh wait, no, I don't see any NTs directly producing 't4'. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but then the string has 't4's at the end, but none of the NTs I see directly producing 't4'. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't4' is the result of a non-terminal that ultimately expands through multiple steps. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's check if any NTs produce something that can terminate with 't4'.\n\nWait, NT48 \u2192 NT52 NT14. If NT52 can produce a terminal, that would help. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT52's productions: NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36. NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26, which again could go on. Wait, perhaps this is a loop I can't resolve.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check for any non-terminals that lead directly to a terminal, which could end the expansion.\n\nLooking again at the grammar:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'.\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'.\n- NT5 \u2192 't2'.\n- NT1 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no, wait the terminal t's are in the string as t0, t1, t2, etc. Looking through, I see:\n\nLooking for NTs that produce the terminals in the string:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\nWait, no, looking back, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't5'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4' ?\nWait, wait, looking at the list of productions, some of them end with terminals, like:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46\n- NT9 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT29 \u2192 't5' (twice)\n- NT30 \u2192 't4' once\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 't3' twice. NT35 \u2192 NT6 NT56; NT6 \u2192 't4'?\n\nNo, actually, looking through the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce 't4'.

Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. This makes parsing easier using algorithms like CYK. But since I don't have to parse here, maybe I can find a way to construct the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that non-terminals like S, NT28, NT57, etc., are used. The start symbol is S, which produces NT28 NT17. So each production is a pair of non-terminals, except for those that produce terminals.\n\nWait, the string consists of a sequence of terminals. The string \"t6 t0 t0...\" etc. So each token here is a terminal. I think I need to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals and whether the overall sequence can be traced through the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the production rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> t3\n- NT5 -> t2\n- NT4 -> t1\n- NT2 -> t5\n- NT9 -> t3\n- NT17 -> t5\n- NT27 -> t6\n- NT3 -> t3, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the given string, the terminals are t6, t0, t0, t0, t0, t4, t4, t4, t0, t6, t4, t0, t2, t1.\n\nI think 't0' might not be a terminal, but perhaps it's a typo or something. Wait, looking back, I see that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce 't' followed by numbers, like t3, t5, t1, etc. But here, the string has t6, t0. Hmm, maybe t0 is a terminal. Or perhaps it's part of a longer term.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals also produce symbols that are part of the terminals. Like NT0 produces 't5'.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT5 -> NT43 NT24\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT0 is an intermediate that produces t5. So maybe t0 isn't a terminal, but is part of the expansion. Wait, no, in the provided string, it's \"t6 t0 t0...\", which would mean these are terminal symbols. So perhaps the non-terminals that produce them are NT27 (t6), NT5 (t0?), NT2 (t5), etc.\n\nWait, but looking again, NT0 -> 't5'. So NT0 produces t5, but the string has t0. That doesn't match. Unless 't0' is a typo, but perhaps the string is \"t5 t0...\" or something else. Wait, in the string it's t6 t0 t0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me list the terminal symbols as per the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals seem to be t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t0. So each 't' followed by a number from 0 to 6. So in the string, t6, t0, t0, etc., are all terminals.\n\nNow, I need to find a way to derive the string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split. So the string is a series of terminals, and each pair of consecutive terminals must be possible to be derived from some intermediate non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S produces NT28 and NT17. So the parse starts with NT28 and NT17, each of which will produce a part of the string.\n\nSo let me think step by step. Maybe I can build a derivation tree.\n\nFirst, S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the string can be split into two parts each generated by NT28 and NT17. Let's see:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT28: S-> NT28 NT17\n\nNT28's rules: NT28 -> NT17 NT7, that's one option. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT28 productions:\n\nLooking through the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nYes, that's one rule. So NT28 can produce NT17 and NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 will become NT17 and NT7, so the initial split will be:\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, let's see the first production:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, now the two non-terminals are NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, the entire string is t6 t0 t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t0 t6 t4 t0 t2 t1.\n\nSo, the first two symbols after S would correspond to NT17 and NT7's productions.\n\nLet's see what NT17 and NT7 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT17 can produce:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' (terminal)\n\nOr other rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's better to check all rules for NT17.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\n- NT17 -> ... any other rules?\n\nYes, checking:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' (as in NT17 \u2192 't5')\n\nWait, no, actually, NT17 is not directly a terminal but has a rule that produces 't5'. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nYes, so NT17 can produce the terminal 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 has several production rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nWait, but looking at the given rules, NT7 has several production rules that all include non-terminals, except for:\n\nWait, looking for NT7's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, looking more carefully, I see at the end:\n\n\"NT7 -> NT15 NT20\"\n\nWait, no terminals there. So perhaps NT7 does not directly produce any terminals. So, perhaps NT7 must be derived from further non-terminals, and so on, until terminal symbols are reached.\n\nWait, but then in the string, the second part is t0, t0, etc., which would need to come from NT7. But if NT7 doesn't produce a terminal directly, perhaps it's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering the production rules. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the entire grammar:\n\nNT7: \n\n- DT -> NT2 NT19\n\n- NT13 NT30\n\n- NT4 NT48\n\n- NT13 NT30\n\n- NT4 NT48\n\n- NT2 NT19\n\nWait, so NT7's rule is NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, etc. So NT7 always produces non-terminals. Hmm. Wait, that can't be, because then how would we get any terminals.\n\nWait, but looking again, is there any NT7 \u2192 't' rule?

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have specific structures where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms to determine whether a string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, most of the production rules do fit the CNF structure. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is a production rule with two non-terminals on the right side, which is allowed in CNF. Similarly, NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47 is another valid CNF production. However, I do notice a few deviations. For instance, some rules have three non-terminals (like NT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13), and a couple have two terminals (like NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26). Wait, NT48 has two terminals; in CNF, each production can have at most one terminal. So that might complicate things a bit because in normal derivations, a production can only introduce one terminal at a time.\n\nBut in this case, the string provided is `t5 t2 t5 t1 t3 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t1 t4`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So the entire string consists of terminal symbols and no non-terminals, which suggests that the entire string is a sequence of terminals derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. So the string must be such that every 't' corresponds to a production that directly produces that terminal, and the non-terminals can be expanded step by step.\n\nBut wait, some productions have two terminals, like NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26. That would mean that during derivation, we'd have to produce two terminals at once, which would split the string into two terminal symbols in one step. But in our string, each 't' is a separate token, meaning that the derivation would have to produce each terminal individually. However, NT48 as a production can only produce two terminals, but in the string, no production step seems to emit two 't's in the same step. That's a problem.\n\nWait, but maybe NT48 is never used in this particular derivation. Let's check the string again. The string is 14 tokens long, all 't's with numbers. The grammar is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the initial step would produce two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me see what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5, but wait NT17 is mentioned as having two productions. Let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I notice that NT17 appears multiple times. The first line is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, then in another line NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and another line NT17 \u2192 NT14 NT27. Hmm, so maybe NT17 has two productions.\n\nActually, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT14 NT27\n\nSo NT17 has two possible productions: it can become NT1 NT58 or NT14 NT27.\n\nThat's a bit confusing. So during the derivation, after S, the first step would be S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, we have to choose which production of NT17 to use. Let's say we choose one of these at each step.\n\nBut wait, the string we're testing is entirely terminal, so we need to see if S can derive the string through a series of productions expanding one terminal at a time.\n\nLet me map out the productions of each non-terminal that can produce a terminal symbol or eventually lead to terminals.\n\nFirst, let's identify all non-terminals that can only produce terminals, without any further non-terminals. These are the leaf nodes in the derivation.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT23 NT26. NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, NT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10. Wait, NT0 has a production: NT0 \u2192 NT21 NT2, and so on. Hmm, this seems to be getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe some non-terminals can only produce terminals.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't5' (terminal)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT5 NT53\n- NT29 can produce NT5 (which might produce t?) or NT53, which has NT54 and NT11, which have more non-terminals.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me try another approach.\n\nThe string is 14 terminals. Since the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17, each step produces two non-terminals. So in the first step, we have two non-terminals. Then, each subsequent step would depend on which productions are used.\n\nSince it's a binary tree, the number of production steps would relate to the length of the string. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that produces a single terminal. Non-terminals, when expanded, would require adding more symbols.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So when you choose which production to use, you can have either a terminal or two non-terminals. However, in our case, the provided grammar has some rules with more than two non-terminals, like NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47 is fine as it's two, but other rules like NT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13 (two) and NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30 (two, including a non-terminal). So in the string, each 't' comes from a production that doesn't have two non-terminals. But our string is entirely terminals, so every step must be a production that leads directly to a terminal.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because some non-terminals are defined in terms of other non-terminals. So to get to a terminal, there must be a path to a production that has only terminals.\n\nLet's see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nThen, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo after S, we have NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Now, let's substitute each.\n\nNT17 can be either NT1 NT58 or NT14 NT27.\n\nSuppose we pick NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nThen we have NT1 and NT58.\n\nNow, NT1: looking at the grammar, maybe NT1 isn't present, but actually, looking at the list, I don't see NT1 as a non-terminal. Oh, this might be a problem. Wait, am I miscounting? Let me look back.\n\nThe grammar provided does not list NT1 as a non-terminal. So perhaps I'm mistaken. Alternatively, perhaps NT1 is generated elsewhere. Wait, perhaps I should check all the non-terminals listed.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT0, NT1 not, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, up to NT58. Wait, no, the list starts at NT2, going up. Wait, in the grammar provided, the left-hand sides of the productions are:\n\nS\nNT28, NT57, NT30, NT40, NT48, NT7 (appearing multiple times), NT44, NT28 again, NT4, NT27, NT44, NT54, NT39, NT45, NT23, NT52, NT57 again, NT40 again, NT33, NT53, NT55, NT14, NT41, NT17, NT3, NT6, NT9, NT57 again, NT30 again, NT20 again, NT2, NT27, NT38, NT17, NT54 again, NT29, NT57 again, NT30 again, NT58, etc.\n\nLooking for NT1: It doesn't appear in the left-hand sides. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. If NT17 can produce NT1 NT58, but NT1 isn't part of the grammar, this could be problematic. That's a dead end, meaning that path might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's try choosing NT17 \u2192 NT14 NT27.\n\nThen, after S, we have NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT27.\n\nNT14 can produce NT53 NT5 (from NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5). But NT53 has productions NT44 and NT21. Wait, NT53 is present on the left-hand side of some productions. Let me check:\n\nNT53"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure because all the productions are either producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it's a sequence of t's with numbers. I see t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t0, etc. The important thing is that each of these corresponds to a terminal symbol. So, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol in this grammar is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. That means the entire string should start with NT28 and NT17. So, the overall structure of the string must come from these initial non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string to see if it can be represented as a series of expansions from S. The string is t1 t2 t5 t1 t3 t5 t0 t3 t4 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t3.\n\nI'll try to map this from the end to see if it can be generated by the grammar. When working backwards from the end, each terminal must correspond to a production that results in that terminal.\n\nStarting from the end:\n- The last part is NT3 \u2192 t3, which matches the last symbol.\n- Before that, NT4 \u2192 t4.\n- Then NT28 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI think using the CYK algorithm would be the best way to parse the string according to the grammar. The CYK algorithm parses context-free grammars in CNF, so that should work.\n\nFirst, I need to process the string token by token and build a table that represents whether a certain substring can be derived from a particular non-terminal.\n\nBut since I'm doing this manually, let me map the string and see if each token can be matched by any production.\n\nThe string has 15 symbols: t1, t2, t5, t1, t3, t5, t0, t3, t4, t2, t3, t2, t0, t2, t3.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, meaning the entire string should be a derivation of NT28 and NT17. So, the first step is to check if t1, t2, etc., can be derived from NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n- NT28 is involved in multiple productions. It can be NT17 NT7, NT44 NT13, etc.\n- NT17 is in several productions, including NT1 NT58 and NT54 NT10.\n\nSince the string starts with t1, I need to see if t1 can come from a production of NT17 or any other non-terminal that can derive to t1.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n- NT17 \u2192 NT54 NT10\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (Is this correct? Wait, looking back, I see \"NT17 -> 't5'\", yes.)\n\nSo, t1 is part of the terminal symbols, and perhaps it's produced directly by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT28 can be NT17 NT7, which could eventually expand into t1 if NT17 can produce t1.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t1. Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 t1. Similarly, t2 is not directly produced, but t0, t2, t3, etc., are.\n\nWait, let me clarify: Each terminal in the string is a result of a production. So, for each tX, I need to see if there's a production that allows a non-terminal to reach tX.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT33 \u2192 t3, and NT6 \u2192 t4, etc. Wait, but in the given grammar, the terminals are represented as strings like \"t3\", but in the productions, I'm seeing rules that have \"t1\", \"t2\", etc.\n\nFor example, looking at the productions:\n- NT54 \u2192 \"t3\"\n- NT11 \u2192 \"t2\"\n- NT0 \u2192 \"t5\"\n\nWait, actually, wait a second: In the grammar, some productions are NTxx \u2192 some terminal, like \"t3\". So, for example, NT54 \u2192 't3' (is that correct? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, some rules have two non-terminals on the right, others have a single terminal. For instance, NT57 \u2192 NT12 NT36, which might derive to a terminal later.\n\nWait, but some of the productions are terminals, like NT30 \u2192 't4' and NT0 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, for example, NT30 can produce 't4' directly. So, in the string, when I see t4, I can look up if that's a result of some production.\n\nSo, to parse the string \"t1 t2 t5 t1 t3 t5 t0 t3 t4 t2 t3 t2 t0 t2 t3\", I need to see if each t corresponds to some non-terminal's terminal.\n\nLet me list the t's and see which non-terminals can produce them:\n- t0: NT21, NT38, NT52, NT14, etc. (Looking through the productions, NT52 can be NT20 NT36, which eventually might produce t0)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should list all non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I can make a list:\n\nNT30 \u2192 t4\nNT0 \u2192 t5\nNT5 \u2192 t2 (Wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT5? Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar is quite extensive. Let me see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24: no terminal.\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7: no terminal.\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2: no terminal.\n- NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51: no terminal.\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT15 \u2192 t0\n- NT29 \u2192 t5\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t1\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT11 \u2192 t2\n- NT56 \u2192 t3\n- NT14 \u2192 t5\n- NT1 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Some productions in the grammar have a terminal, like:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, these are direct productions to terminals.\n\nSo, for example, NT11 \u2192 't2' means that NT11 can directly produce t2.\n\nSo, in the string, whenever there's a t2, it could come from NT11. Similarly, t3 can come from NT17 \u2192 't3'.\n\nWait, no, looking at NT17's production: I think earlier I saw NT17 \u2192 't5', but now I'm confused. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the production for NT17 is: NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and NT17 -> 't5'. So, NT17 can produce 't5' directly. So, t5 in the string must come from NT17.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals can come from direct productions of certain non-terminals.\n\nSo, let's go through each symbol in the string and see if the corresponding non-terminal can produce it.\n\n1. t1: Does any non-terminal directly produce t1?

{"custom_id":"request-253","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to check is `t3 t0 t1 t5 t3 t1 t1 t0 t0 t0 t3 t6 t5 t4 t0`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG. CNF grammars have production rules where each non-terminal symbol is replaced by exactly two non-terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, and the productions are all of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. Additionally, some non-terminals may produce terminal symbols directly when they can't split further.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTnumber \u2192 NTanother NTanother, which are non-terminals leading to other non-terminals. However, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols like 't3', 't0', etc. These are the base cases and will be the leaves in the parse trees.\n\nThe string we need to check is `t3 t0 t1 t5 t3 t1 t1 t0 t0 t0 t3 t6 t5 t4 t0`. Since it's a space-separated string, each identifier (like t3, t0) represents a terminal symbol. \n\nThe approach to solve this is to simulate the derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if we can generate the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation processes a non-terminal and splits it into two new non-terminals, unless a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's note that the start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S directly expands into NT28 and NT17. Therefore, the first two symbols in any valid derivation must be the results of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is t3. So, either NT28 or NT17 must derive to t3.\n\nLet's check the production rules for NT28 and NT17:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 or NT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have misread NT17's production.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a Chomsky normal form grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems all the productions fit this form, so that's good.\n\nThe string consists of terminal symbols: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Let me note that t3 represents NT7 and several other non-terminals, but for the string, we don't have to track all the non-terminals; we just need to verify that the sequence of terminals follows the productions.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT57 and NT28 (S \u2192 NT57 NT28). So the string must start with t57 (which leads to t5 via NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT3 but wait, in the string it starts with t5. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the string step by step and try building a parse tree. Alternatively, maybe I can use the leftmost derivation approach. Let me think about the terminal string.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which I think corresponds to NT9 in the grammar because looking at NT57's productions, it eventually leads to t5 and t5, but I might be getting confused. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT57 production is NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9, and NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT3, NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (which could derive t3), etc. But in the string, the first symbol is t5, which must be generated by a non-terminal that can produce t5. Looking through the grammar, I see NT39 \u2192 NT56 NT30, NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30, etc., but more importantly, there's NT56 \u2192 NT35 NT33, but I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t5 immediately. Wait, no, looking back at the bottom of the grammar, there's a list of non-terminals that directly go to t's.\n\nWait, actually, I should look for non-terminals that produce t4, t5, etc. Here's a list:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n- NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n- NT36 \u2192 NT5 NT3\n- NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7 (which is NT2 NT19, but maybe not directly)\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar's productions and see if a leftmost derivation can match the entire string.\n\nThe string is: t5 t4 t0 t1 t5 t5 t4 t6 t6 t6 t0 t1 t6 t1 t5 t2.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, which produces NT57 NT28. So the first two symbols must be the concatenation of the productions of NT57 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9. So first, we get NT19 and NT9. But in the string, it's t5 t4... which might correspond to NT57's production leading to t5 (from NT19) and t... something else?\n\nWait, maybe I should think recursively. Let me start at the first symbol, which is t5. I need to find a production that ends in t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT2 \u2192 but nt3 and nt2 don't produce t5 directly.\n- NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6 \u2192 nt21 could be NT35, but not sure.\nWait, maybe I should look at each non-terminal that can produce t5.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36: No, this produces t5 and t36.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9: Maybe NT5 could produce t5? Wait, NT5's productions are... Looking through, I don't see NT5 producing terminal symbols. All NT5's productions are into other non-terminals. Similarly, other non-terminals might lead eventually to t's.\n\nWait, here's an important note: The only terminal symbols in the grammar are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, each corresponding to different non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to see which non-terminals can derive each terminal.\n\nLooking through the bottom of the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 \u2192 eventually, but how does it lead to t3?

Maybe I should make a list of all non-terminals and see which produce which terminals.\n\nStarting from each production that has a terminal, I can list the non-terminals that can produce each t symbol.\n\nI'll make a note:\n\nt0:\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT21 \u2192 't4' (looking at NT21's productions: NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2, NT3 \u2192 t3 \u2192 t3 doesn't produce t0, NT21 \u2192 NT19 NT41 \u2192 NT41 \u2192 ... Hmm, maybe NT21 can produce t4, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for each t symbol in the grammar and find the non-terminals that produce them.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nFor t3 (which is represented by NT9?):\nLooking for t3 in the bottom:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (which will eventually produce t9, but that's another path)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\nWait, perhaps NT33 is producing t6 and t... Hmm, maybe I should make a list.\n\nLooking for each production that ends with a terminal symbol, I can note which non-terminals can derive which terminals.\n\nt0: Look for NT's whose productions include t0.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT36 \u2192 maybe... Wait, it's getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t4 t0 t1 t5 t5 t4 t6 t6 t6 t0 t1 t6 t1 t5 t2.\n\nI'll try to parse from the start.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT57 NT28.\n\nSo, the first parts will be something derived from NT57 and NT28.\n\nNT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9.\n\nSo after S, we start with the production of NT57: NT19 and NT9.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t5. So let's see what NT57 can produce. NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9.\n\nLooking at NT19, which may produce t4 (since NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT3, which might end in t4 and t3). Wait, but nt4's production is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, which also leads to terminals, but perhaps later.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the first part of the string:\n\nt5. So perhaps NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT3. NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. NT5 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, maybe NT36 produces t5? Looking at production NT36 \u2192 NT21 NT3. So NT21 may produce t4. Wait, not sure.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe I should consider building a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm for this, but considering the string and grammar, it might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the string and see if the non-terminals can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAnother approach: Since each symbol must come from a single non-terminal production, perhaps we can group the string into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nThe string: t5 t4 t0 t1 t5 t5 t4 t6 t6 t6 t0 t1 t6 t1 t5 t2 (16 symbols)\n\nBut the grammar produces sequences of two, so maybe each production at a certain level results in two symbols, etc.\n\nStarting from S, which produces two non-terminals, so after S, we should have two parts. The string is 16 symbols, so if we can partition it into 8 pairs, each pair derived from NT57 and NT28.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nFirst two symbols: t5 and t4. These could be produced by NT57's two productions: NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-274","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large with many productions, and the string to check is 't0 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t6 t6 t4 t5 t1 t2 t0 t4 t0 t2'.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal in a single step. So, to generate a string with n terminals, the derivation would have 2n-1 steps because each production either combines two non-terminals or adds a terminal, and the number of symbols doubles each step until it's reduced to a single string.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 16 terms. So, the derivation length should be 2*16 -1 = 31 steps. However, that might not be directly helpful because the actual parse tree could be more complex, but knowing the length might help check if the string is too long or too short.\n\nBut since the string length is 16, which would require a derivation of length 31, I need to see if the grammar can handle that. Maybe I can approach this by trying to trace the derivation or see if the string can fit into a parse tree with the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can start from the start symbol and try to find a way to reach the string. The start symbol is S, according to the grammar: S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which is two non-terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 needs to expand into a string that, when expanded fully, ends up being the given string. Let me see the productions for NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking up production rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 or NT17 \u2192 NT27 NT27\n\nWait, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. And NT17 has two possible productions: either NT1 NT58 or NT27 NT27. Let's pick one to explore.\n\nLet me try expanding S:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) (NT17 or NT27 NT27). This feels a bit messy. Maybe it's better to see what terminal symbols are produced from each non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the bottom of the grammar, for NTx productions, each eventually leads to terminal symbols 't0' to 't6' or the axiom A.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals: for example, NT52 \u2192 't2', NT32 \u2192 't1', NT21 \u2192 't0', etc. So, each step can produce a terminal or continue with non-terminals.\n\nSo, maybe I can try to parse the string backwards, seeing if each part can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be matched by the left-hand side (LHS) of the productions or by stepping through possible derivations.\n\nLet me list the string: t0 t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t6 t6 t4 t5 t1 t2 t0 t4 t0 t2.\n\nHmm, the string starts with t0, which according to the productions, seems to come from NT21, since in the grammar I see NT21 \u2192 't0' or NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2. Wait, no, let me check.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t0:\n\nFrom the productions, NT21 \u2192 't0' is not present. Wait, checking the bottom of the grammar:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the bottom, some have direct terminals:\n\nLooking for 't0' in the productions: Yes, in NT11 \u2192 NT5 NT45, but that doesn't directly produce 't0'. Wait, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nWait, actually, in the productions, I see:\n\nFor instance, NT21 \u2192 't0' is not present. Looking back, the productions in the list don't show that directly. Wait, maybe I misread earlier.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar again. Oh, wait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce certain terminals.\n\nLooking for direct terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, for example, 't0' is produced by NT41 \u2192 't0' (if I see NT41 \u2192 't0'? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for non-terminals that have a production leading to a terminal:\n\nYes, for example, NT3 \u2192 't3', NT6 \u2192 't4', NT9 \u2192 't3', etc. Wait, so some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, in the given string, starting with 't0'. So, I need to check if 't0' can come from some production.\n\nLooking for NT that produce 't0': From the provided bottom of the grammar, I see NT47 \u2192 't3', NT51 \u2192 't0'? Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the productions, for NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41, but also, looking at the bottom of the grammar, many non-terminals have direct terminal productions. For example, NT915 \u2192 't3', NT41 \u2192 't0' or other.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to parse the string from the beginning, seeing if the grammar can generate each symbol step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down using the productions.\n\nThe string is: t0, t4, t3, t2, t2, t1, t6, t6, t4, t5, t1, t2, t0, t4, t0, t2.\n\nIt's 16 tokens, so each terminal in the derivation should correspond to a step where a non-terminal expands into a terminal.\n\nGiven that each step in the derivation either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal, the total number of steps would be 2*16 -1 = 31, as I thought earlier.\n\nNow, perhaps it's helpful to see if the string is well-formed in terms of grammar. Since the string is composed of several terminals, each must be generated by a non-terminal production.\n\nLet's take the first token: 't0'.\n\nWhich non-terminals produce 't0'?\n\nLooking for NT \u2192 't0' in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT41 \u2192 't0' is not present. Wait, actually, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the bottom, NT20 \u2192 NT23 NT26, which is for NT20. Or maybe I'm not seeing it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's produced by other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should see which non-terminals can derive 't0' through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT21 \u2192 't0' is not present. Wait, looking through the given grammar:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\nLine: NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2\n\nSo NT21 produces 't0' if NT35 can produce 't0' or another path leads to it.\n\nWait, then I might need to track the possible productions for each non-terminal to see if they can produce the required terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reconstructing the parse tree from the string might be a better approach.\n\nLet me start with the first token, 't0'. It must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't0' via some derivation.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7. If NT3 produces 't3' and NT7 can produce some terminal, but not 't0'.\nWait, perhaps NT47 has a production. Looking for 't0' in lower non-terminals:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't0'. Let me re-examine the productions.\n\nLooking at the bottom:\n\nLine: NT21 \u2192 't0' (Yes, finally found it): NT21 \u2192 't0' is present.\n\nWait, yes, I see under the grammar:\n\nLooking at the bottom part of the grammar:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\n\nSo, NT21 can directly produce 't0'. That's useful.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't0', which comes from NT21. So, one part of the string is generated by NT21 \u2192 't0'.\n\nNow, we can split the string after 't0': the remaining is t4 t3 t2 t2 t1 t6 t6 t4 t5 t1 t2 t0 t4 t0 t2.\n\nWait, but the derivation tree would have S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and each NT28 and NT17 would have their own productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is built by concatenating the strings generated by NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (something from NT28) and (something from NT17), which together should produce the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-291","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break down how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar. It's presented with various non-terminals (like S, NT57, NT30, etc.) and production rules. The terminals are represented by strings with 't' followed by a number, like 't3' or 't5'. My task is to check if the string `t2 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t0 t5 t5 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t3 t6 t1` is generated by this grammar.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are in a form that makes parsing manageable, maybe using something like the CYK algorithm.\n\nBut wait, I'm not going to use an algorithm here. Instead, I'll try to parse the string manually step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the productions for reference. I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t1\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT15 \u2192 t0\n- NT21 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t1\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT33 \u2192 t6\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT11 \u2192 t2\n- NT0 \u2192 t5\n\nI think the last non-terminal to produce a terminal is S, but I need to see its production. Let me check.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol S is in the first rule: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S can produce NT28 followed by NT17. Now, I need to see what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 = NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, NT17 appears in several productions. From the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and also NT17 \u2192 t5. Wait, in the given grammar, there's NT17 \u2192 t5, yes. And also, earlier I see NT27 \u2192 t1.\n\nLet me map out the string: t2 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t0 t5 t5 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t3 t6 t1.\n\nI think it might be helpful to write the string as a sequence and see how the non-terminals can derive the string step by step.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S, which produces NT28 NT17. So, the structure is two parts: NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it starts with S and is split into two parts.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to break down the string using possible production rules.\n\nThe string has 17 tokens. Let me think about the possible ways.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the first step would be to split the string into part1 (from NT28) and part2 (from NT17).\n\nBut I don't know how to split the string. Instead, perhaps I can approach this recursively.\n\nLet me check NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 expands into NT17 and NT7. So, the string derived from NT28 is [something from NT17][something from NT7].\n\nSimilarly, NT17 is in the middle, so let's look for possible derivations.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t5 or NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT17 is written as NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, but also as NT17 \u2192 t5. Wait, no, looking again, in the given grammar, the productions for NT17 include NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and also a terminal t5.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I think I may have misread. Let me list the productions for NT17.\n\nFrom the grammar lines:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n- Also, in another line: NT27 \u2192 t6 (but that doesn't help), and looking higher, maybe I missed any direct terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the list, the only direct terminal for NT17 is: Wait, I see that in another part of the grammar, under NT54, it's NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43, which isn't relevant. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, looking through all lines, I might have misread. Let me check carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines again:\n\n- I see NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT11 \u2192 t2\n- NT0 \u2192 t5\n- Others: for example, NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23.\n\nWait, do any non-terminals directly produce t5? Yes, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 can produce t5. So, in the string, the first token is t2. That doesn't directly match S's first part.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe using the CYK algorithm approach would be better, but since I'm doing it manually, let's proceed step by step.\n\nLet me start by checking possible parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t2 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t0 t5 t5 t4 t0 t1 t0 t4 t3 t6 t1.\n\nI notice the first token is t2. Let's see which non-terminals produce t2.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t2 and NT11 \u2192 t2. Also, looking at the rules further down, NT33\u2192t3, so not helpful. So, possible sources for t2 are NT4 or NT11.\n\nIf the string starts with t2, it could be produced by either NT4 or NT11.\n\nLet me check NT4's production: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nWait, that's a two-symbol terminal, so that's a problem because the first token is t2, but the production would generate 't', making it 't' followed by something else. Wait, no, NT4 \u2192 t2, which is a single terminal. Wait, no: looking back, no, in the grammar, NT4's production is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. So, NT4 doesn't produce t2 directly; wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, in the list, I see NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, but also NT36 \u2192 't5', and NT5 produces which terminals? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I think I might have missed some terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, there's a line: NT40 \u2192 NT47 NT11. Also, at the end of the grammar, the non-terminals seem to be mapped to terminals. Wait, let me list the terminals as per the grammar's last part:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t1\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT15 \u2192 t0\n- NT21 \u2192 t0\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t5 (already listed)\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT33 \u2192 t6\n- NT4 \u2192 t2 (Wait, is that a terminal? Looking back: the last part starts with NT17 \u2192 't5'. So, looking earlier in the grammar, I see:\n\nUnder the list, the last few lines are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\nNT25 \u2192 't5' (Wait, no, looking again: it's:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules as presented by the user:\n\nHere's the end:\n\n...\nNT36 \u2192 't5'\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\nNT30 \u2192 't4'\nNT30 \u2192 't3'  (Wait, no, the lines are a bit confusing. Let me parse the grammar properly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to list all the production rules and their terminals. Let's try to group all the rules that produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, each line is either a production A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or a continuation.

The string is `t3 t1 t1 t4 t5 t0 t6 t6 t0 t0 t6 t0 t5 t5 t6 t5 t6`. Hmm, that's quite long, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars, especially in Chomsky normal form, each production rule divides the left-hand side into two non-terminals. So, each step involves replacing a symbol with two others. The string is made up of terminal symbols, which in this case are the 't' followed by numbers, like t3, t1, etc. The non-terminal symbols are the NTs like NT1, NT2, etc.\n\nLooking at the top-level grammar, it's `S -> NT28 NT17`. So, the top symbol is NT28 and NT17. Let's see what production rules they have. \n\nNT28 can be produced by NT17 and NT7, according to the rule NT28 -> NT17 NT7. NT17 can go to NT1 and NT58. NT58 is another symbol, and looking it up, NT58 -> NT1 NT15. Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with t3, t1, t1, so I can try to see where these 't's come from. Looking at the 't' rules: NT32 -> t1, NT29 -> t5, etc. Let me try to find how t3, t1, etc., are generated.\n\nWait, perhaps it would be easier to work backwards. Each terminal in the string must come directly from a production rule. So, for each 't' symbol, I need to check if there's a production that directly results in it.\n\nLooking at the 't' rules:\n\n- NT58 -> 't5' (and its related rules)\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT20 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT21 -> 't0'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't2'\n- NT1 -> 't5'\n\nWait, but some produce multiple 't's? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Each 't' is a direct production. Let me list all the 't' symbols and see their possible sources:\n\n- t1 can come from NT32, NT32 can be derived from NT44 and NT1, etc.\n- t2 from NT5, NT10, etc.\n- t3 from NT13, NT2, NT17, etc.\n- t4 from NT20, NT27, NT30, etc.\n- t5 from NT58, NT9, NT17, etc.\n- t6 from NT21, NT33, etc.\n\nBut the string has a specific order: t3, t1, t1, t4, t5, t0, t6, t6, t0, t0, t6, t0, t5, t5, t6, t5, t6.\n\nThis is 18 tokens. Let me try to parse it step by step.\n\nStart with S: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So the string must derive into something starting with NT28 and NT17. Let's focus on NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 can be replaced by NT17 and NT7. But wait, from the grammar, NT28's production is NT17 and NT7, meaning we have S => NT17 NT7. Hmm, but perhaps it's built up differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string using the reverse approach: see if each part can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence: t3, t1, t1, t4, t5, t0, t6, t6, t0, t0, t6, t0, t5, t5, t6, t5, t6.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n1. t3: This must be from a production like NT3 -> t3, or perhaps NT17 -> t5 and another NT produces something else, but according to the 't' rules, NT17 -> 't5', so maybe that's not the start. Wait, perhaps the initial NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, let me reconsider: the string starts with t3, which comes from which NT? Looking back, NT2 -> t5, NT17 -> t5, NT3 -> t3, NT6 -> t4, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce t3 directly, as NT3 -> NT19 NT55, but NT3 also has a production to t3, I think. Wait, the 't3' rules are:\n\nNT3 -> t3\nNT33 -> t3\nNT4 -> t2\nNT5 -> t43 NT24? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the 't' symbols:\n\nLooking at the NT production rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> NT19 NT55\nNT4 -> NT5 NT36\nNT5 -> NT43 NT24\nNT6 -> NT6 NT4\nNT? Let me check all 't's.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the end of the grammar:\n\nNT3 -> t3 (I think I might have missed this earlier)\nNT6 -> t4\nNT9 -> t3\nNT17 -> t5\nNT2 -> t5\nNT27 -> t6\nNT3 -> t3\nNT6 -> t4\nSo, t3 can come from NT3, NT27, etc.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t3, which could be from NT3 or NT27 or others.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting from the top.\n\nS => NT28 NT17\n\nSo, the root is S, which is NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet's see the possible components:\n\nNT28 can be derived as per the rules:\n\nLooking up NT28, it can be derived as NT17 and NT7.\n\nSo, from S, we have NT28 (which is NT17, NT7) and NT17 (which is NT1, NT58).\n\nWait, that can't be right. Alternatively, S's production is S-> NT28 NT17, so each of these NTs will become parts of the string.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence generated by expanding S into NT28 and NT17. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet me list all the expansions step by step, but that might take too long. Perhaps a better approach is to count the number of symbols, but the string has 18, while the grammar's start would generate a certain number of symbols.\n\nWait, each production rule creates exactly two symbols, so the length doubles each time. But since the grammar is context-free, the number of symbols in the string should be such that starting from S (1), each step increases the count by a factor determined by the productions. But the string length is 18, which is even, but not necessarily a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by breaking it into parts that correspond to the NT rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see how the terminals are generated step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t3 t1 t1 t4 t5 t0 t6 t6 t0 t0 t6 t0 t5 t5 t6 t5 t6.\n\nLet me try to break it down.\n\nStart with the beginning: t3.\n\nPossible source for t3 is NT3 or NT27 (since both can directly produce t3).\n\nAssuming it's NT3, then perhaps NT3 can generate t3 and some symbols. Wait, looking at the production rules for NT3:\n\nNT3 can be:\n- NT19 NT55\n- t3\n- NT55 NT6\n- NT32 NT3\n\nHmm, so if it's generating t3 directly, the substring could be just 't3'. But in the string, after 't3', there's 't1', which might not make sense if 't3' comes from a different production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't3' comes from NT2, which can produce t5, but that's not matching. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for a leftmost derivation.\n\nS expands into NT28 and NT17.\n\nFrom NT28, it can be NT17 and NT7.\n\nFrom NT17, it's NT1 and NT58.\n\nSo, initial steps:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7, NT1 NT58"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the productions, they mostly involve NT and lowercase letters. The lowercase letters look like terminals, and the NTs are non-terminals.

Starting from S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 and NT17 is a production. Let's break down NT17. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41, but wait, I get confused. Maybe I should look for how each NT can generate the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions of the NTs. For example, looking for t6 at the beginning. Is t6 generated by any NT?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT36 \u2192 t4, NT32 \u2192 t1, NT6 \u2192 t4, NT33 \u2192 t3 and t6, and so on. Hmm, t6 is generated by NT33 \u2192 t6.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6, which would generate t6 as one of the terminals. But NT33 can only go to t6 and t3, right? Wait, looking back, NT33: yes, NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6 and NT33 \u2192 NT35 NT6, but NT56 is involved also. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to build parse trees step by step. Let's attempt to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nFirst, the string is 18 tokens: t6, t3, t3, t3, t2, t0, t4, t5, t1, t2, t6, t5, t3, t6, t6, t2, t3, t1.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, NT28 must generate the first part, and NT17 the latter part.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, NT17 is t6? Wait, looking at the productions, NT17 has multiple productions: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and later on, in the string, there's a t6 followed by t3. Maybe NT17 \u2192 t6?\n\nLooking again, NT17 can be expanded into NT1 NT58. Then, NT1 can be NT58 NT41, which in turn is ... wait, this seems too deep. Perhaps I'm not seeing the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. If NT17 is part of the earlier productions, let's see. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and then NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Hmm, not helpful. Wait, maybe NT17 has a production that includes t6.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT17 directly being a terminal. It's only using other non-terminals. So, perhaps NT28 needs to expand into a combination that includes t6.\n\nWait, looking at NT28's production again: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, perhaps each of those can expand into certain terminals.\n\nLooking at NT7, the productions are NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, and NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30. So, each of these could lead to various non-terminals. If NT28 expands into NT17 and NT7, and then each of those expands further, perhaps we can get the desired t6.\n\nLet me try this step by step. Let's consider NT28.\n\n1. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, we have two parts: NT17 and NT7.\n\n2. Now, NT17 has two productions:\n\n   a. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\n   b. Later in the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 't5' but looking at the list, it's NT27 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no:\n\nWait, actually, at the end of the productions, I see:\n\nNT17 is a production: NT17 \u2192 't5'?\n\nWait, no, looking at the end of the provided grammar, the last few productions are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nActually, yes, at the end, it says:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, let me check: Yes, there's a line that says NT17 \u2192 't5'. So, NT17 can directly produce 't5'. Good.\n\nSo, going back, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Now, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 can be 't5', and NT7 needs to produce something that will give us the next terminals.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t6. So, if S is generating NT28 NT17, and NT17 is 't5', that would mean the second part of the string starts with t5, but the string starts with t6. That's a problem. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 expands into something that includes t6, and NT17 is something else.\n\nWait, maybe I got mixed up. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking again, the start symbol S is NT28 NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, perhaps NT28 is generating something else, but maybe I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is just the top rule, and each of those can be expanded further. So, maybe NT28 and NT17 need to generate sequences that match the string.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree.\n\nThe string is t6, t3, t3, t3, t2, t0, t4, t5, t1, t2, t6, t5, t3, t6, t6, t2, t3, t1.\n\nThe first symbol is t6, so somewhere in the derivation, NT28 must generate t6. Let me see where t6 is generated.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT33 \u2192 t6. Specifically, NT33's productions include NT55 NT6, which can lead to t6. Also, other productions for NT33 include t3 or t6 with other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be divided into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach: the string is processed from left to right. Each step involves consuming some symbols and expanding a non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be reduced step by step.\n\nBut that might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of symbols. The string has 18 symbols. Each production either increases the number of non-terminals or not. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (like A \u2192 BC) or with a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So NT28 can become, for example, NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 has a production rule: NT17 -> NT7 NT30 and NT17 -> NT58. Oh, and looking at the grammar, NT17 also has another rule: NT17 -> NT58.

Let's see which non-terminals can produce t6.\n\nLooking at the rules, terminal symbols are things like t6, t5, t4, etc., and non-terminals are things like NT28, NT17, etc. So t6 can only be produced by a non-terminal that has a rule ending in t6.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33 can produce NT55 NT6. So NT33 -> NT55 NT6. Therefore, NT6 is a rule that ends with t6. Similarly, NT33 can also produce NT21 NT6. So NT33 -> NT21 NT6.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I need to list all non-terminals and see which can generate t6.\n\nLet me look for non-terminals that have rules ending with t6.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT33 -> NT55 NT6\n- NT33 -> NT21 NT6\n- NT11 -> NT26 NT46 (which maybe leads to t6 if NT46 ends with t6)\nWait, but t6 is only directly in NT33 and maybe other places.\n\nWait, let's start with the initial step: S generates NT28 NT17. Let's consider expanding NT28 as NT44 NT13. Then we have S -> NT44 NT13 NT17. Or perhaps expanding NT28 as NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, this might take a while, but let's try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for a parse tree that can match the entire string.

The first symbol is t6. So I need a production that can generate t6 as the first symbol. From the rules, I see NT23 has a rule NT23 -> NT7 NT11. Not helpful. NT45 has a rule NT45 -> NT56 NT33. Hmm. NT33 can produce NT21 NT6 or NT55 NT6.\n\nWait, so if a non-terminal can produce t6, maybe we can backtrack.\n\nWait, let's think about the first symbol, t6. The only non-terminals that can produce t6 are those that have a production ending in t6. From the rules:\n\n- NT11 -> NT43 NT20\n- NT24 -> NT53 NT43\n- NT3 -> NT19 NT55\n- etc.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT33 -> NT55 NT6 and NT33 -> NT21 NT6. So NT33 can produce t6 as the second or third token depending on what precedes it. Wait, no. The production is, for example, NT33 -> something followed by NT6. But terminal t6 can only be generated by a production where the last symbol is t6.\n\nWait, no, the production NT33 can have a production like NT33 -> NT21 t6 or NT33 -> NT55 t6.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given rules, the only production that yields t6 is in NT33: NT33 -> NT21 NT6 and NT33 -> NT55 NT6.\n\nSo to get t6 as a terminal, we need a non-terminal that is generating something that ends with t6. That non-terminal would be NT33.\n\nSo maybe the parse tree starts with NT33 -> t6 and something else. But wait, no, because the production is NT33 -> X t6, so the parse tree would have non-terminal NT33 generating X and t6 in sequence.\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to start. Let's think about the first few symbols:\n\nt6 t2.\n\nSo perhaps the first non-terminal is NT33 generating t6 and another non-terminal generating t2.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT33's production, it can generate something like NT21 t6 or NT55 t6. So perhaps NTT33 generates NT21 and t6. Then the first symbol is t6, but that would require the second symbol to be NT21, which is a non-terminal. But our string is t6 t2...\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should look for a non-terminal that can generate t6, which would require that non-terminal to correspond to a production rule that ends with t6.\n\nSo the first token is t6, which must come from a production where the last symbol is t6.

I'm a bit new to context-free grammars, but I'll try to figure it out. So, the task is to determine if the given string \"t1 t5 t4 t4 t3 t0 t2 t5 t1 t1 t6 t1 t2 t1 t0 t1 t5 t6 t4\" can be generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the right-hand side of the productions, I notice many are two-terminals or non-terminals, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nNext, the string is composed of the tokens t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and 't5', etc., but actually, all are terminals since they are 't' followed by numbers. So, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar through these productions.\n\nThe provided grammar has a lot of rules. For example, 'S' starts the process, with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and each non-terminal eventually needs to produce a terminal. The leaves in the grammar are 't0' to 't6', and some others like 't3', 't5', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals. Let's note the length: 19 tokens separated by spaces. So, the string is 19 tokens long.\n\nNow, since it's a context-free grammar, we can use the CYK algorithm to parse the string. The CYK algorithm is suitable for this because it efficiently checks if a string is generated by a given CFG.\n\nBut wait, I remember the CYK algorithm works for any context-free grammar and can determine membership. However, since I'm a bit rusty, maybe I can approach this by trying to break down the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, building a parse tree. The string is t1 t5 t4 t4 t3 t0 t2 t5 t1 t1 t6 t1 t2 t1 t0 t1 t5 t6 t4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to create a memo or table and track possible non-terminals at each step. But maybe I can start from the beginning and see if I can match the string with the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the first step is to split the string into parts that can be derived from NT28 and NT17. But this might be complicated without a table. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar more carefully. Some non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals directly. For instance, NT17 \u2192 't5' (as per NT17 \u2192 't3' and NT17 \u2192 't5'), but actually, looking again, the productions for NT17 are NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT17 \u2192 't3'. Also, NT27 \u2192 't6' etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the full list of productions includes 't's as terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30 | NT44 NT8 | NT19 NT9, but looking more closely, there are productions where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal. For example, NT17 \u2192 't3' (I might have miscounted earlier).\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT17 we have:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 -> 't3'?\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user provided a huge block of grammar rules. Let me check carefully.\n\nYes, in the productions, NT17 is defined as:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nWait, no, checking again:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nand\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nWait, but looking at the end of the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nBecause in the end, it's:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nSo, NT17 can be 't5' directly. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't6', and others.\n\nSo, now, the start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the string must be generated as [NT28 derivation] followed by [NT17 derivation].\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so NT28 is NT17 NT7.\n\nBut then, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nBut that would require that the first part of the string is NT28's derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this more methodically.\n\nLet me try to represent the string as a list of tokens and see if I can find a derivation path.\n\nThe string is: [t1, t5, t4, t4, t3, t0, t2, t5, t1, t1, t6, t1, t2, t1, t0, t1, t5, t6, t4]\n\nLet me try to split this into possible NT28 and NT17. Since S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, what I need is that the first part (let's say, some tokens) can be derived from NT28, and the remaining tokens can be derived from NT17.\n\nSo, let's suppose that the string is split into two parts at some point, let's say, after k tokens, where NT28 can generate the first k tokens, and NT17 generates the remaining 19 -k tokens.\n\nWe need to find such a k where both parts are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be handled by recursively applying the productions.\n\nBut maybe the CYK algorithm is a more efficient way to check.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I can attempt a few steps manually.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S must expand to NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nThus, S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, S expands to NT28 NT17, and then NT28 expands to NT17 NT7. So, S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nBut then, each NT can expand further.\n\nThis might get too complicated. Maybe another approach is to list out all possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal in the string and see if a valid path exists.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string, let's see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor 't1': Looking through the grammar, I see if any NT has a production that directly outputs 't1'. Scanning through, I see that NT38 \u2192 't4' (from NT38 \u2192 't4'), but 't1' might come from other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe NT13 has a production that leads to 't1'. Or perhaps some other NT.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in 't1', 't2', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3' (since looking at NT9's productions: looking for 't3' in NT9. Yes, the user wrote:\n\nNT9 -> NT15 NT20\n\nWait, no, looking at the end of the grammar, under NT9:\n\n\"NT9 -> t3\"\n\nSo, NT9 can directly produce 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for how each NT can produce a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-325","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t6 t3 t1 t0 t1 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3 t0 t2 t0 t6 t5 t0 t6 t1`, and the grammar is pretty long with many production rules. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, it seems most of the rules fit this form, but I also notice that some rules have terminals on the right-hand side, like S -> NT28 NT17, so this is a production starting with a non-terminal but producing two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions should have two non-terminals on the right. So, let me check: the start symbol S leads to NT28 and NT17, both NTs, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but then, when do terminal symbols appear? Because terminals can only appear on the right side of a production in CNF, but not on the left. So any production that has a terminal on the left side would not be in CNF. Hmm, looking at the grammar, I don't see any rules where a non-terminal is on the left with a terminal on the right. Wait, some rules start with NTs and have combinations of NTs and terminals? For example, looking at NT38 -> NT8 NT51, and NT8 is 't3', so that's a terminal. Oh, wait, no, in CNF, all productions are from a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nCNF requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 B, or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, in the given grammar, I need to check if all rules are of that form. Looking at the grammar, some rules are like NT38 -> NT8 NT51. NT8 is a terminal, so that's acceptable because it's a combination of a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all right-hand sides can only be terminals or pairs of non-terminals, but any production that has a terminal must have exactly one terminal. So a production like X \u2192 aY is allowed in CNF because 'a' is a terminal and Y is a non-terminal.\n\nBut in this grammar, what about the start symbol S? It's S -> NT28 NT17. Both NT28 and NT17 are non-terminals, so that's fine. Let me check another rule: NT7 -> NT2 NT19. That's two non-terminals, so it's okay. But looking at NT7 -> NT13 NT30, same thing. Hmm, wait, some rules have more than two non-terminals? For example, NT23 -> NT7 NT41 NT11. Wait, that's three non-terminals on the right-hand side. But that contradicts CNF, which only allows two. So that would mean this grammar isn't in CNF, right? Because some of the rules have more than two non-terminals, which violates the condition of CNF.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I see rules like NT23 -> NT7 NT41 NT11. That's three non-terminals, so that production is not in CNF. That's a problem. Because if the grammar isn't in CNF, then it's not valid as per the problem statement, or perhaps the user made a mistake. But wait, the user specified that it's a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. So perhaps I need to double-check. No, actually in the given grammar, some rules have three non-terminals on the right, like NT23 -> NT7 NT41 NT11. That would mean the grammar is not in CNF, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me look again: the problem says the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form. So if any rule has more than two non-terminals on the right, that would mean it's not in CNF. But in the provided grammar, I see at least NT40 -> NT28 NT21. Wait, but NT28 -> 't5' (from the given replacements), which is a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT40 is a non-terminal and its production is NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21. So that's two non-terminals, which is okay.\n\nBut then, for example, NT23 is not in the top-level rules, but looking for other rules, perhaps elsewhere. Wait, no, I think the user has provided a correct CNF grammar, but perhaps I'm looking at a different part. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm misunderstanding. Let me take a step back. The problem gives a string and a grammar, and tells me that the grammar is in CNF, so I can assume the grammar as given is indeed in CNF. So perhaps I just need to look at the productions where S and the rules down below.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, but since it's part of the problem, I need to work with it. So assuming it's correctly given as CNF, let's proceed.\n\nSo, the string to check is `t0 t6 t3 t1 t0 t1 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3 t0 t2 t0 t6 t5 t0 t6 t1`. \n\nNow, to check if this string is generated by the grammar, I can simulate the derivation starting from S and see if I can arrive at this string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree or use the pumping lemma, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, I can try to find if each 't' in the string corresponds to a terminal, perhaps derived from non-terminals that can produce certain 't's.\n\nWait, the given grammar, all the non-terminals when expanded lead to certain terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at NT2 -> 't5', NT3 -> 't3', NT4 -> 't2',NT5-> 't5', etc.\n\nSo each non-terminal, when ultimately derived, leads to a certain terminal. For example, S leads to NT28 and NT17, which are 't5' and 't5' respectively. Wait, but in the given replacement, S is replaced by NT28 and NT17, but in the string S will need to generate a string of terminals. Wait, in the problem, the string starts with t0, which is a terminal, but in the S rule, S -> NT28 NT17, both are non-terminals. So to get to terminals, those non-terminals must derive into some terminal. Let me see.\n\nWait, S is a non-terminal, and it's replaced by two non-terminals (NT28 and NT17). So when S is at the top, I must have a derivation where each of these non-terminals expands into a string of terminals, concatenated together. So the string should start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT28 and NT17. But in the given string, it's t0 followed by t6, etc.\n\nSo perhaps I can look at the S production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S generates the string by deriving from NT28 and NT17. So in order to parse the given string, the first string generated by NT28 must be some substring, and NT17 generates the rest.\n\nBut this could get complex. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent each step of the derivation as a transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the given string from the end, using a recursive descent approach, but since this is time-consuming, perhaps a better approach is to look for the structure of the string.\n\nLooking at the given string:\n\nt0 t6 t3 t1 t0 t1 t4 t5 t5 t0 t3 t0 t2 t0 t6 t5 t0 t6 t1\n\nLet me count the number of terminals: 19 terminals. So the derivation will start from S, which produces two non-terminals, which themselves produce terminals. So the string should have an even number of non-terminals each expanding to at least one terminal.\n\nWait, but each non-terminal can expand into a string of terminals or non-terminals. Since S produces two non-terminals, the initial expansion is S \u2192 ... \u2192 all terminals, so the number of terminals must be even? But the given string has 19 terminals, which is odd, which is impossible because S's expansion will generate an even number of terminals if all non-terminals expand into one terminal each. Wait, no: non-terminals can expand into multiple terminals, so the total number can be odd or even as long as it's generated appropriately. Wait, perhaps that's not the key here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Each non-terminal must expand into a certain string.

However, since I might not be familiar with all the details of CYK, I can also approach this by trying to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S must start with NT28 and NT17. Wait, but our string starts with t5, which is a terminal. So first, I need to check if t5 can be derived from NT28 or NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 and NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33. Hmm, both have NT17 and NT7. Also, NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13.\n\nNow, I'm looking for t5 in the grammar. Checking the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15, etc. Wait, t5 is a terminal. Looking through the productions, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces t5 except in some cases.\n\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, I see NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT9, and NT9 \u2192 t5. So NT9 can produce t5. That means, if we can derive t5, then NT9 must be part of that.\n\nSo, maybe I can start by seeing if the string can be broken down into parts that match these productions. But it's getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the string has several t's, and looking at the grammar, some terminals are followed by others. For example, t5 can be generated by NT9 \u2192 t5. T2 can be generated from NT4 \u2192 t2, which is directly a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar. Since the start symbol is S, I need to start from S and see if the derivation can reach the given string.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S must expand to NT28 and NT17 on each side.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5. So for NT28 or NT17, perhaps one of their productions can start with t5.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, which starts with NT17 (t2 maybe?), or NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33.\n\nWait, but t5 is a terminal. Let me see which non-terminals can directly produce t5.\n\nLooking through all productions, I see NT9 \u2192 t5, and NT52 \u2192 t2, NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36, etc.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me try to list the steps.\n\n1. The string starts with t5. So which non-terminal can produce t5? Only NT9 can, as NT9 \u2192 t5.\n\n2. So, the first part of the string is t5, which comes from NT9. Therefore, in the derivation, somewhere we must have NT9 \u2192 t5.\n\n3. Looking at where NT9 is used. Let's see, NT9 is used in several rules, like NT9 \u2192 t5, but also in others.\n\n4. Now, since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals. So to get t5 as the first symbol, the left-hand side must be a non-terminal that eventually produces t5 in one step, i.e., has a production that directly maps to t5, but in CNF, you can't have a direct terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, a non-terminal can't directly produce a terminal; instead, terminals are present in the productions as a single symbol. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the terminals are given as a single character. But in this case, in the grammar provided, most productions are A \u2192 BC, and some are A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT9 \u2192 t5 is a production. So NT9 can directly produce t5. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 t2, NT5 \u2192 t4, etc.\n\nSo, for the first t5 in the string, it must come from NT9 \u2192 t5.\n\nNow, since S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and the string starts with NT9 \u2192 t5, perhaps NT17 can produce something else. Wait, no, the entire string starts with t5, which would require that the first part of the string is generated by a production that starts with NT28. Wait, but S is NT28 and NT17, so the first symbol must come from NT28 or NT17.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so when we start expanding S, the first symbols must come from NT28 and NT17. So, the string starts with t5, which would come from NT28 or NT17. However, the first part of the string is t5, which is a terminal. So, to get t5 as the first symbol, the production of NT28 must produce t5 on the left or the production of NT17 must produce t5 on the left.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33, NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13, and NT28 \u2192 NT28 NT7? Wait, no, not in the given grammar. Looking at the given grammar, NT28's productions are: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33, NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13.\n\nWait, none of NT28's productions directly produce t5. So the first t5 must come from the left-hand side that comes from NT28 or NT17. Wait, but NT28 and NT17 don't have a production that directly yields t5. NT28's productions all result in other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but NT17 can be derived into something that ends with t5. Let me check NT17's productions. NT17 \u2192 t5, according to the given grammar: NT17 \u2192 't5' and also NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo NT17 can directly produce t5. Therefore, if the first symbol t5 comes from NT17 \u2192 t5, then that's possible.\n\nBut looking back, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the left-hand side is NT28 and NT17. So the expansion would be something like NT28 generates A, and NT17 generates B, so the overall string is A B.\n\nSince the first symbol is t5, then B must be t5. So B comes from NT17 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo, the first part is t5, generated by NT17. So that handles the first t5. Now, the rest of the string needs to be derived from the other part, which is NT28.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which would become NT28's derived string followed by NT17's derived string. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of NT28's derivation and NT17's derivation.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t5, which comes from NT17 \u2192 t5. Now, the rest of the string is 't2 t3 t0 t4 t4 t3 t2 t2 t2 t0 t6 t1 t3 t1 t5 t4 t6 t3 t4'.\n\nWait, but the entire string should be generated by S, which is NT28 followed by NT17. So the first t5 is from NT17, and the rest comes from NT28.\n\nSo, after the first t5, the rest of the string (all 19 symbols) must be generated by NT28.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, then t5 is generated by NT17, so the remaining symbols should be generated by NT28.\n\nWait, no, S is NT28 followed by NT17, so both nt28 and nt17 contribute to the entire string. So the entire string is a concatenation of what nt28 generates and what nt17 generates.\n\nThus, the overall structure is nt2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-353","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: `t2 t0 t4 t0 t1 t3 t6 t0 t4 t2 t1 t6 t4 t1 t0 t3 t4 t1 t0 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the start symbol S will derive the entire string by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals, following these production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see the start symbol is S. The productions for S and other non-terminals are all in CNF, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with `t2` and ends with `t6`. I need to see if this can be built starting from S. So, probably the first step is to see how S can produce the initial part.\n\nLooking at S's production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Hmm, but terminal symbols like t2, t0, etc., can't be part of non-terminals in the grammar. So perhaps S is an initial symbol, and the entire expansion is done through the non-terminals leading to terminals. So I need to trace a possible derivation starting from S and see if it can produce this string.\n\nEach production for non-terminals produces two non-terminals, which then need to further expand until terminals are produced.\n\nBut this might take a while, as the string is long. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this as a parser or a finite automaton. Alternatively, perhaps I can represent the grammar as a tree where each node is a non-terminal that ultimately expands into the given string.\n\nBut let me try to break down the string into segments that match the productions. The string is `t2 t0 t4 t0 t1 t3 t6 t0 t4 t2 t1 t6 t4 t1 t0 t3 t4 t1 t0 t6`.\n\nI wonder if each production's left-hand side (LHS) corresponds to a part of this string. For instance, looking at the S production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first part is NT28, which would produce a sequence of terminals that starts with t2, but I need to check if NT28 can derive `t2`.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 expands into NT17 and NT7. Now, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. Oh, this seems complex. Wait, but each step produces two non-terminals, so maybe the entire expansion is a binary tree of depth proportional to the string length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each `t` in the string is generated by a non-terminal that directly expands to that `t`. For example, maybe some NTs produce a specific `t`. Let me check the grammar for any terminal symbols. Oh wait, the grammar given is in CNF, so all the terminals (like t0, t1, etc.) must directly appear in the productions. So each non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI see that there are some rules like NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, and so on. Wait, looking at the terminal symbols, I notice that some non-terminals do produce specific terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the string, I see `t2`, `t0`, `t4`, etc. Let me check if these terminals are produced by any of the non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some rules that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n- NT17 \u2192 NT45 NT26\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\n- NT37 \u2192 NT\u2026 Wait, actually, looking through the given rules, I only see some non-terminals that directly produce terminals. Let me list them:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (I think? Wait, looking at the given rules, for example: NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, not a terminal. But wait, hold on. Looking closely:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the list ends with:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, that's not correct because in the given rules, I don't see these terminals appearing. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' \u2014 yes, in the last part of the grammar it says NT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't6', NT3 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't2', NT5 \u2192 't1', NT0 \u2192 't5'.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me look again:\n\nWait, the last part has:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo now I understand. Some of the non-terminals, like NT17, NT27, NT3, etc., directly produce a terminal. So for example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 't3', NT4 \u2192 't2', NT5 \u2192 't1', and NT0 \u2192 't5'.\n\nThat's important. So any time a non-terminal like NT27 expands, it produces a single terminal 't6'. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo the string starts with `t2`, which must come from a NT that produces 't2'. Looking at the NTs, NT4 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo, to get 't2', the NT must be NT4, which directly expands to 't2' (since NT4 \u2192 't2').\n\nSo in the derivation, we need to expand a non-terminal that produces 't2', which is NT4.\n\nSo perhaps the initial expansion is something that gives NT4 and another NT. Looking back at the grammar, maybe S expands into something that, along the derivation, produces NT4 as one of the left-hand sides.\n\nLooking at S, S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nThen, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 \u2192 NT45 NT26.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should try to find a path from S to the string, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the entire string as a leftmost derivation, but that could take a while. Maybe a more efficient method is to model this as a parser and see if there's a way to parse the string with the given grammar. Alternatively, using the CYK algorithm for this grammar.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some NT, and check the connections between them.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So each terminal in the string must come directly from some NT. So each terminal is produced by a single NT, which in turn must be derived from other NTs until the start symbol S is reached.\n\nSo the first step is to see if 't2' can be produced by any NT, which it can: NT4 \u2192 't2'.\n\nSo in the initial string, the first element is 't2', so in the derivation, there must be a point where a non-terminal expands into 't2', which is NT4.\n\nNow, considering that the rest of the string is `t0 t4 t0 t1 t3 t6 t0 t4 t2 t1 t6 t4 t1 t0 t3 t4 t1 t0 t6`, so after 't2', it's 't0', which is produced by NT5 \u2192 't1'? Wait, no. Let's look again: NT5 \u2192 't1' (because earlier in the rules: NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24, but I'm not seeing any rule where NT5 produces a terminal. Wait, no, wait, the rules in the grammar list have some that produce terminals, like NT7 \u2192 't3', but wait, looking back through the entire list:\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-368","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is: `t0 t2 t6 t1 t6 t2 t1 t1 t6 t5 t2 t4 t3 t3 t1 t5 t2 t3 t3 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can be a single non-terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the productions are in the form of two non-terminals. However, I also see that some productions might not fit perfectly into two non-terminals. Wait, I think that in some cases, there might be more than two symbols on the right-hand side, which would disqualify it from being in CNF. Let me check the grammar again. Hmm, actually, it seems like all the productions are of the form NT \u2192 NTs, so each rule is exactly two non-terminals. So, it should be in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string `t0 t2 t6 t1 t6 t2 t1 t1 t6 t5 t2 t4 t3 t3 t1 t5 t2 t3 t3 t0 t3` to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. Since the string is in terms of terminals (like t0, t1, etc.), I need to work backwards from the start symbol S in the grammar to see if this string can be generated.\n\nTo approach this, I think of the string as a sequence of terminal symbols produced by the non-terminals in the grammar. Each terminal symbol in the string corresponds to a production where the right-hand side (RHS) includes that terminal. For example, if a production A \u2192 BC, then either B or C must produce that terminal.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production only has two non-terminals. So, when deriving, each step of the derivation splits a non-terminal into two, each of which can themselves split until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me try to think about how to approach parsing. It might help to look for sequences in the string that match production rules. Alternatively, since it's a matter of recognizing the string, maybe I can use a recursive descent parser approach, building the parse tree from the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to represent the string in a way that's compatible with the grammar. Let me list the string as a sequence:\n\nt0, t2, t6, t1, t6, t2, t1, t1, t6, t5, t2, t4, t3, t3, t1, t5, t2, t3, t3, t0, t3.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first two non-terminals should be NT28 and NT17. Let me see what each of these produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, NT28 splits into NT17 and NT7. Then, I need to find what NT17 and NT7 produce. Looking at NT17's production: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. That's two non-terminals, NT1 and NT58.\n\nContinuing, NT1 is in the grammar as NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. NT58 is NT58 \u2192 NT4 NT30. NT4 is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. NT5 is NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6. Wait, but in the given string, t0, t2, t6, etc., I don't see NT54, NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41, which has t2 and t6? Wait, actually, let me check if t0, t2, etc., correspond to those non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's map the string to the grammar's production steps. The string starts with t0, which is a terminal. So, I need to find a production that includes t0 on the RHS. Looking through the grammar, I see NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46 and others, but perhaps I should look for t0 terminals.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar, the terminals are things like t0, t1, etc. So each non-terminal leads to some terminal when applicable. For example, T-terminals can come from NTs like NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24, but NT24 could lead to t3. Let me see\u2014looking for terminals t0, t2, etc.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the string: t0, t2, t6, t1, t6, t2, t1, t1, t6, t5, t2, t4, t3, t3, t1, t5, t2, t3, t3, t0, t3.\n\nI can start from the start symbol S, which produces NT28 NT17. So, the first two symbols in the parse should be the result of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me think. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the results of NT17 and NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So, the next symbols should be the result of NT1 and NT58.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nSo, the symbols after that would be NT58 and NT41.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT4 NT30.\n\nSo, next would be NT4 and NT30.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nWhich would be NT5 and NT36.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6.\n\nWhich would give NT3 and NT6.\n\nWait, hold on, let's check the production for NT5: yes, it's NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6.\n\nSo, the fifth step: NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6. So, in the string, the first five symbols would be generated by S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 NT1 NT58 \u2192 NT58 NT41 \u2192 NT4 NT30 \u2192 NT5 NT36 \u2192 NT3 NT6.\n\nWait, so the first six steps would be S = [NT28, NT17] \u2192 [NT17, NT7], then [NT1, NT58], then [NT58, NT41], then [NT4, NT30], then [NT5, NT36], which gives me NT5 is a production of NT3 NT6, so NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6. Therefore, in the string, the first six symbols should be NT3 and NT6.\n\nWait, but the string is in terms of terminals, so I need to find if these non-terminals produce the required terminals.\n\nLet me see: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT4 NT30.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6.\n\nThen, NT3 and NT6 would be the next in the string. But in the given string, the first six symbols are t0, t2, t6, t1, t6, t2. So, perhaps this approach is getting too bogged down, and I might be overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother approach is to represent this as a tree and see if the string aligns with the productions. Let's construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the root is S, left child is NT28, right child is NT17.\n\nThen, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So the left child of NT28 is NT17, right child is NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So NT17 splits into NT1 and NT58.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. So NT1 splits into NT58 and NT41.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT4 NT30. So NT58 splits into NT4 and NT30.\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. So NT4 splits into NT5 and NT36.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT3 NT6. So NT5 splits into NT3 and NT6.\n\nWait, this seems too long. Maybe I'm making a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the string is too short for such a deep recursion, but I'm getting into too many layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the end of the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last symbols are t0 and t3. So, perhaps the leaves in the parse tree end with t0 and t3.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find which non-terminals produce t0, t1, t2, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce the terminals. For example:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 t4\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-370","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. \n\nThe given string is `t2 t3 t3 t0 t4 t2 t1 t2 t6 t5 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t6 t2 t2 t4 t5 t4`. I notice 't's here, which probably represent terminals after a certain substitution. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT2-> 't2', NT3->'t3', and so on.\n\nFirst, I should make sure that I'm not mixing numbers in the grammar with the actual structure. The only 't's in the string come from the productions where the NT ends with 't' followed by a number. Like NT2 produces 't2', etc. So each 't' in the string corresponds to a unique non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the right-hand sides (RHS) don't have 't's. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the 't's in the string are the result of the terminals in the RHS productions. That is, each production in the grammar leads to some terminals and non-terminals. The 't's are terminals, so each 't' in the string must correspond to a terminal in some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some of the RHS have 't's followed by numbers. For instance, NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, which doesn't have a 't'. Wait, no, some productions do have 't's. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5', which is 't' followed by 5. So in the grammar, NT17 produces 't5', which is a terminal string consisting of 't' followed by 5.\n\nBut in the given string, the terms are like 't2', 't3', etc., which suggests that each 't' is followed by another number. So each 't2' is a terminal string 't2', which can only be produced by NT2.\n\nBut looking back, the grammar doesn't seem to have any non-terminals that produce a single 't'. Instead, NT's like NT2 produce 't2', so each 't' is part of a larger string. However, in this problem, the 't's follow a number, like 't2' 't3', so each 't' is a separate string element.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The string is a sequence of 't's with numbers, such as 't2', 't3', etc., each separated by a space. So it's a list of terminal symbols. For example, the string is composed of tokens 't2', 't3', 't0', etc.\n\nNow, considering the grammar, each production on the RHS has non-terminals. To see if the string is in the language, we need to find a derivation path from the start symbol S to this string by expanding non-terminals into terminals and non-terminals.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S is replaced by NT28 and NT17. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 becomes NT17 and NT7. Now, NT17 \u2192 't5' as per the grammar, which is a terminal. Then, NT7 has multiple productions. One of them is NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Let's take that.\n\nSo now, we have NT13 and NT30. Let's look at NT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7. So NT13 becomes NT1 and NT7. NT1 has a production NT1\u2192 't2' (from NT1 \u2192 NT3 NT24 but no, wait, looking back, I don't see NT1 in the production list. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has some NT's like NT21, NT27, etc.\n\nWait, let me check the production list again. Oh, I might have missed some NT's. For example, looking at the end of the list:\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23.\nNT10 \u2192 NT23 NT21.\nNT32 \u2192 NT46 NT1.\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I notice that some NT's don't have an explicit 't' production. Wait, no, in the grammar, each production ends with a terminal or another non-terminal. The only 't's are when a non-terminal produces a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5', which is a terminal string 't5'.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So S expands to NT17, NT7, NT17. Now, let's expand each of these step by step.\n\nNT17\u2192 't5' (since NT17 \u2192 't5').\nNT7\u2192 one of its productions is NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 (t5 NT13 NT30) t5.\n\nWait, but NT30 expands to NT15 NT30, because NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30. That's a recursive production. So NT30 is NT15 followed by NT30. Let me see, this would create an infinite loop unless NT15 can expand to a terminal or another non-terminal that can eventually expand to a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7. So substituting, S's derivation becomes complicated. This seems like a problem because NT30 is a loop. Maybe I should check if the string can be derived without such loops.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string is manageable without expanding loops. Let me try alternatively.\n\nLooking at the string to be derived: t2 t3 t0 t3 t4 t2 t1 t2 t6 t5 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t6 t2 t2 t4 t5 t4.\n\nThat's 21 elements. Let's count the length: 21.\n\nEach element represents a step in the derivation. Let's try to see how the string can be broken down.\n\nThe start symbol S leads to NT28 NT17, which is 't5' as before. Wait, but in the string, the first element is 't2'. That suggests that the expansion must eventually produce 't2' somewhere. But NT28 leads to NT17 and NT7. NT17 is 't5', but we have 't2' as the first element, which is not possible. That's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is incorrect. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me see.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S becomes NT28 and NT17, which in the string would translate to two elements. But the string has 21 elements, which is odd because it's S leading to two non-terminals, which would split into 21 elements, implying that the derivation must include many splits and joins.\n\nWait, but wait, in the initial expansion, S is two non-terminals, which after substitution would produce four non-terminals, but some produce terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into 21 elements, each corresponding to a terminal in the RHS. Since each production step is of non-terminals, each time a non-terminal is expanded, if it produces a terminal, that's one element, and if it produces non-terminals, they can expand further.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't2', so there must be some non-terminal that expands into 't2'. Looking at the grammar, is any non-terminal that can produce 't2'?

{"custom_id":"request-383","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each right-hand side is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to fit that structure, so that's a good start. \n\nThe string to check is: `t5 t5 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t2 t5 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t6 t2 t3 t2 t4 t3 t0 t6`. That's quite long, but I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S has the production S -> NT28 NT17. So, the initial expansion of S will involve NT28 and NT17.\n\nI'll need to trace the derivations or maybe build a parse tree to see if the string can be generated. Another approach is to convert the grammar into a parsing strategy, like using the CYK algorithm, but given the size of the grammar and the string, that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the components of the grammar. Let me look at each non-terminal and their possible productions with terminals.\n\nStarting with the first part of the string, t5 appears twice. Looking at the grammar, NT29 -> t5 and NT20 -> t3 (but wait, NT20 also has some productions involving other non-terminals). So, the initial t5 might come from NT20 if some rules lead to it.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT20 has several rules, for example, NT20 -> NT52 NT26, NT20 -> NT21 NT57, etc. Hmm, perhaps it's better to list all the terminals and see how they can be derived.\n\nLet me note down all the terminal symbols from the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules, terminals are:\nt5, t5, t0, t3, t4, t3, t2, t2, t5, t4, t2, t4, t4, t1, t6, t2, t3, t2, t4, t3, t0, t6.\n\nWait, compiling the list of terminals present in the grammar:\nt5, t3, t4, t2, t0, t1, t6, t9, t8, t7.\n\nBut in the string, I see t5, t0, t3, t4, t2, t1, t6. The other symbols like t9, t8 are not in the string, so maybe they are not needed. But since the grammar can produce any of these, as long as the given string's symbols can be produced without involving the unused ones.\n\nNow, looking at the productions that lead to terminals.\n\nLet's list the productions where the right-hand side results in terminal symbols:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19 (no terminal, unless NT2 or NT19 produce terminals)\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT40 -> NT28 NT21\n- NT40 -> NT28 NT21 ... Wait, maybe it's better to make a mapping of each non-terminal that can eventually produce a terminal.\n\nLet me create a list of non-terminals that can be directly produced into terminals:\n\n- NT27 -> t6 (from NT27 -> t6)\n- NT7 -> if it can reach a terminal, but unless the left-hand side non-terminals produce terminals, it won't. So, for example, NT7 can lead to t2 or t19, but t19 is not in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a tree of possible terminals from each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about a specific string, perhaps working backwards from the terminals is easier.\n\nLet me see the string as a sequence: t5 t5 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t2 t5 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t6 t2 t3 t2 t4 t3 t0 t6.\n\nGiven the string is a list of terminals, I need to see if they can fit into some leftmost derivation from S.\n\nLet me start with the entire string as derived from S, which is two non-terminals (NT28 and NT17). So:\n\nS = NT28 NT17.\n\nI need to see if the string can be split into two parts, one generated by NT28 and the other by NT17. Let me check NT28's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 can be:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nWait, checking the productions: NT28->NT17 NT7, yes. So, NT28 can first divide into NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, the string must start with what NT28 generates. Let's see what NT28 produces.\n\nWait, the first symbol of the string is t5. So, if NT28 can produce t5, but looking at NT28's productions:\n\nOnly NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which are non-terminals. So, NT28 itself will need to be expanded recursively until terminals are reached.\n\nSimilarly, NT17's production is: NT17 -> NT1 NT58. So, NT17 can start the derivation with NT1 (non-terminal) and NT58.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me consider using a stack-based approach, like the CYK algorithm, but perhaps manually tracing the possible splits.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can find a way to split the string into multiple parts that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each symbol in the string is covered by the grammar's terminals. Since all symbols in the string are present in the grammar as terminals, that part is okay. Now, the structure of the string must conform to the production rules.\n\nMaybe I can check if there's a way to partition the string into parts that match the non-terminals.\n\nFor example, starting with S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nLet me try to find if the first part (t5) can be generated by NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 can only expand to NT17 NT7, so it's a two-symbol non-terminal product. So, the first part of the string should be generated by NT28, which is a combination of two non-terminals. So, the string must split into two parts, one generated by NT17 and the other by NT7.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. Let's see what generated t5. Looking for t5 in the grammar terminals: NT29 -> t5, NT19 -> t5, etc. So, I need to see if t5 can be produced by either NT29 or NT19.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string can be divided into smaller chunks that match the productions.\n\nAnother idea is to work recursively. The string is a list of t5, t5, t0, t3, t4, etc. Let's see:\n\nS = NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58.\n\nSo, S would expand to NT17 NT7 NT58. Now, each of these NTs may further expand:\n\nNT1 can have productions that might include more NTs or terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT1: Is there any production for NT1 that includes a terminal? Let's check the production list.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I don't see any NT1 -> t, so NT1 must eventually expand into NTs.\n\nBut wait, in the given list, I don't see NT1 defined. Did I miss it?\n\nWait, going back to the grammar, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI see NT57, NT28, etc. Let me scan for NT1.\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\nI don't see NT1 explicitly listed. Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me read through all the productions again:\n\nLooking for NT1: It's not present. So, perhaps NT1 is a typo? Or perhaps it's another non-terminal that's referenced but not defined here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the grammar. Maybe NT1 is defined elsewhere, but in the provided list, I don't see it. So, perhaps NT1 is non-terminal but not present, which might be an issue.\n\nBut for now, assuming that NT1 can only produce non-terminals, since no terminal is listed under it.\n\nSo, in the derivation, when S expands to NT28 NT17, then to NT17 NT7 NT58, and then NT7 and NT58 need to expand.\n\nNT7 can produce various combinations. Let me see:\n\nNT7 can be expanded as:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nSo, both options produce two non-terminals, unless one of those further terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, after the first t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The terminals here are t3, t6, t4, t5, t0, t1, t2. Checking the grammar, all these terminals are either directly rewritten by some rule or are non-terminals that eventually derive to these.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t3. Looking at the grammar, NT3 can be either 't3' or derived from NT19 and NT55. Since t3 is a terminal, I can directly match it, so the first t3 is satisfied by the production NT3 \u2192 't3'.\n\nNext is t6. Looking for where t6 is a terminal. In the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't4', which doesn't match t6. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check the NT productions again.\n\nLooking back, NT33 \u2192 't3' or 't6' because NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6 and NT55 \u2192 't2' (from NT55 \u2192 NT29 NT54, and NT29 \u2192 't5', and NT54 \u2192 't3'). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, checking all the terminals and their possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t6 can be derived from NT33 and NT55? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all terminal strings in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, the terminals are t3, t6, t4, t5, t0, t1, t2 as per the rules. Now, any non-terminal that can derive directly to these terminals would have that production.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (from NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, but that's a non-terminal derivation. Wait, no: NT7 can also be NT4 NT48, but that's non-terminal. So perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, no, looking back: for example, NT3 \u2192 't3' or another non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-400","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string to evaluate is `t4 t6 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a string generated by a grammar in CNF must consist of a sequence of terminals that correspond to the leftmost derivations according to the rules. Since the grammar is small, maybe I can parse the string step by step, checking if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules again. The start symbol is S, which is initially `S -> NT28 NT17`. So the first production should start with NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t4 t6`. Wait, the first token should be derived from S -> NT28 NT17, which would be a string starting with the first symbol of NT28's expansion, which is 't4' according to the rules. So nt28 => 't4' and nt17 => 't6' based on the given rules.\n\nSo the first two tokens, t4 and t6, would come from NT28 and NT17 respectively.\n\nNow, after using S, we have remaining non-terminals NT28 and NT17, which are now part of the parse tree leaves. So the next tokens should come from these non-terminals expanding further.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recursive descent parser or simulate the expansion step by step. Let me think in terms of steps:\n\n1. S starts as NT28 NT17. So the string must start with NT28 and then NT17. The first token is t4 (from NT28) and the second is t6 (from NT17). So the first two tokens match.\n\n2. Now, we have to derive the remaining string, which is `t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2`.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the entire string is `t4 t6 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2`.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to process the string as a sequence and see if it can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to process the string step by step, keeping track of open non-terminals and expanding them as needed.\n\nLet me write down the string again: \n\n1. t4\n2. t6\n3. t2\n4. t0\n5. t3\n6. t4\n7. t3\n8. t2\n9. t5\n10. t6\n11. t5\n12. t3\n13. t3\n14. t4\n15. t2\n16. t3\n17. t3\n18. t4\n19. t4\n20. t1\n21. t3\n22. t0\n23. t2\n\nWe start with S: NT28 NT17. So after processing t4 and t6, we're left with NT28 \u2192 't4' and NT17 \u2192 't6', so the string is now processed up to the second token, and we have to parse the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, no. The start symbol S expands into NT28 and NT17, each of which expand into a sequence of terminals. So the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, the entire string must be the expansion of NT28 followed by the expansion of NT17. So I can split the string into two parts: the expansion of NT28 and the expansion of NT17.\n\nLooking at the string: The first token is t4, which comes from NT28. Then, the second token is t6 from NT17. So the rest of NT28's expansion starts after t4, and NT17's expansion is followed by the rest. Wait, no, because the expansion of S is NT28 first, then NT17, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT28's derivation and NT17's derivation.\n\nSo after the first two tokens, I have to parse the remaining part of the string as the expansion of NT28 followed by the expansion of NT17, but perhaps this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the parsing as a stack, using the leftmost derivation approach.\n\nLet me try that. The stack starts with [S]. We read the first symbol, which is t4. We need to find a production for NT that starts with t4. Looking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 t4 (since NT28's expansion is 't4')\n\nSo we replace S \u2192 NT28 NT17 with 't4' and push NT17 and any remaining symbols to the stack. Wait, no, in a leftmost derivation, when a symbol is replaced by its body, the next symbols in the body come next.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the stack as the current state of the parse stack, processing symbols.\n\nLet me approach it as a recursive descent parser, keeping track of the current position in the string and the stack of symbols to parse.\n\nInitialize: position = 0, stack = [S], string = \"t4 t6 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2\"\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model the stack as [S] and at each step, pop the top, and see if it's a terminal or non-terminal. If it's a non-terminal, replace it with its production.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Stack is [S], current position 0, symbol is 't4'.\n\nS is a non-terminal, so look for its first production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nReplace S with (NT28, NT17). Stack becomes [NT28, NT17].\n\nNow, look at the top of the stack which is NT17. But NT17 is a terminal, so check if the current string symbol matches the first symbol of NT17's expansion. NT17 \u2192 't5'? Wait, according to the rules:\n\nLooking at NT17: from the given rules, NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo for NT17, the first token should be 't5'. But the string's current symbol is 't6'. So that's a mismatch.\n\nWait, no. Wait, after replacing S with NT28 NT17, the stack is [NT28, NT17]. Now, we take NT28 first, because it's leftmost.\n\nSo, NT28's expansion is 't4'. So the first symbol to consume is 't4', which matches. So we replace NT28 with nothing (since it's the leftmost and 't4' is the terminal), and push the rest symbol if any. Wait, no, since NT28 is replaced by 't4', which is a terminal, the stack becomes [t4, NT17]. Now, we move to the next symbol, which is the first symbol of NT17.\n\nBut NT17's expansion starts with 't5', but the next token in the string is 't6'. So that's a problem. So the current stack is [t4, NT17], and the current position is 1 (t6), so comparing the first symbol of NT17's production ('t5') with the current token 't6' does not match.\n\nThis suggests a possible mismatch. However, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is that S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the entire string must be the concatenation of NT28's expansion followed by NT17's expansion. So after checking t4 from NT28, the next must check if the next part of the string matches NT17's expansion.\n\nWait, the first part is t4 from NT28, the second is t6 from NT17. So NT28 produces t4, NT17 produces t6. So the string would be 't4 t6'. But the string starts with 't4 t6', so that's correct so far.\n\nSo now, after these two tokens, the remaining string is tokens 3 to 23: 't2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t2 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2'.\n\nNow, we have to parse the remaining string.

{"custom_id":"request-399","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t2 t0 t6 t4 t6 t1 t5 t3 t6 t4 t6 t6 t4 t1 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1`. The grammar provided is a bit complex with a bunch of productions, so I'll need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. From CNF, I know that the language can be generated by a pushdown automaton, and the structure of the string should reflect the derivation steps, especially with non-terminals expanding to terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all non-terminals are expanded eventually into sequences of terminals except for a few. For example, some NTs expand into other NTs, but eventually, they all lead to terminals like 't0', 't1', etc., which I assume are the atomic symbols of the string.\n\nThe given string is of length 21, so it's a pretty long string, but I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nStarting with the string, each token is either a non-terminal or a terminal. Since all the productions in CNF expand non-terminals into two non-terminals except for when they expand into a terminal, the string should consist of a series of expansions that ultimately result in terminals, and the order should match the structure imposed by the grammar.\n\nI notice that the first symbol is 't2', which is a terminal. Let's check which production in the grammar results in t2. Scanning through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't2' (from NT4's production: NT4 \u2192 't2'). Also, in NT2, the production is NT2 \u2192 't5', but maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me look carefully. The NT2 production isn't listed here; perhaps I need to check each NT's production. Wait, no, the user provided the grammar, so I need to refer to those.\n\nLooking back, the last part says:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT15\nBut earlier in the grammar:\n\nNT2: NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10\nNT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33\nNT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\nNT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2\nWait, this might be getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the parsing as a bottom-up or top-down process.\n\nIn top-down parsing, the start symbol is expanded, and each step introduces non-terminals, until terminals are reached. However, parsing from a bottom-up approach might be easier sometimes, especially if the string can be matched in segments.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each possible production that results in the string by checking if the string can be split into two parts that correspond to the left-hand side of a production.\n\nWait, perhaps the better approach is to represent the string as a sequence of symbols that can be generated by the grammar, perhaps by trying to find a way to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the productions that result in terminals, as these will directly match the string's symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (if I remember correctly, but in the provided grammar, maybe it's not directly)\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, it lists:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2' (from \"NT4 -> 't2'\")\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4' (from \"NT6 -> 't4'\")\n\nNT0 \u2192 't5' (from \"NT0 -> 't5'\" \u2014 wait, but in the provided grammar, the last part is:\n\n...\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT21 -> 't0'\nNT33 -> 't3'\nNT33 -> 't6'\nNT4 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't2'\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nSo, NT0 \u2192 't5', and NT4 \u2192 't2', NT6 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nSo the string `t2 t0 t6 t4 t6 t1 t5 t3 t6 t4 t6 t6 t4 t1 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1` can be analyzed by trying to see if each part can be matched by a production.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits a non-terminal into two parts, so each symbol in the string (except the first and last) should be part of the expansion tree in a way that the overall structure aligns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent this as a series of split points where the string can be divided into chunks that match the productions.\n\nMoreover, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, a terminal.\n\nTherefore, when parsing from left to right, for each non-terminal, we can explore the possible productions that could split the string into two parts, each compatible with the non-terminal's left-hand side production.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can produce the given string.\n\nLet me also note that since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree, and the string length should be 2^k for some k, but our string length is 21, which is not a power of two, so that might indicate some issues, but perhaps the grammar allows for that with merging.\n\nWait, no, the length of the string in CNF can vary because each non-terminal can produce more than one symbol in a step. Let's see: Starting from S, which may produce NT28 NT17, and each of those can produce more non-terminals, and so on, so the string length can indeed be anything, as long as the structure aligns.\n\nHmm, to approach this, perhaps I can use a recursive descent parser or try to see if the string can be split into segments corresponding to the productions of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the problem as a series of possible expansions, considering the given string and trying to match the possible production sequences.\n\nLet me start by noting that the entire string must be derived from S. Let's write the string as:\n\nt2 t0 t6 t4 t6 t1 t5 t3 t6 t4 t6 t6 t4 t1 t2 t1 t0 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t1\n\nThe first symbol is t2, so looking back to the grammar, t2 appears in NT4's production:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nBut let's check if the grammar has NT4 \u2192 t2 or if it's part of a longer production. Wait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2' \u2014 yes, at the end of the list, NT4 is one of the NTs.\n\nSo, can S derive to a production that results in the first symbol being t2? Wait, S starts as:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28: it's in the grammar as:\n\nNT28 -> NT44 NT13\n\nWait, but another NT28 is in the grammar:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7 (from the early part of the list: \"NT28 -> NT17 NT7\")\n\nSo NT28 can expand into NT17 and NT7. Or, alternatively, in other lines:\n\nAlso, NT28 -> NT14 NT33 (maybe not, let me check the exact grammar:\n\nLooking again, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28 NT17\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nAnd then looking through the non-terminals, I see:\n\nNT28 is mentioned several times, e.g., NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and another line:\n\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33 (if applicable?), but wait, no, in the full list, looking for NT28:\n\nAh, here's NT28: \"NT28 -> NT17 NT7\", but let me check if that's the only definition of NT28.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT28 is given several productions, including:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT14 NT33\n- etc.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me recheck the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, let me re-examine it step by step.\n\nThe grammar is as follows:\n\n- S -> NT28 NT28 NT17\n\nWait, no"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is a good starting point because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to analyze.\n\nFirst, I notice that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has two main types of production rules: either a non-terminal (A) expands into two other non-terminals (BC), or a non-terminal can produce a terminal symbol (like 't2', 't0', etc.). So, I should start by mapping the CNF rules provided to see how they can generate terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S generates NT28 and NT17. These are non-terminals, so I'll need to see how they expand further.\n\nThe next step is to break down each of these non-terminals into their respective productions. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, then NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, and so on. But wait, each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nI also notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols, like NT2 \u2192 't5', NT3 \u2192 't3', and others. So, I can track the string by following these productions.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t2 t0 t0 t6 t1 t6 t6 t0 t2 t0 t6 t3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t2 t2 t5 t4 t1 t0`.\n\nLet me think of this as a series of steps through the grammar. Each step consumes two non-terminals and produces two terminals, or it produces a terminal.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT28 NT17. Let's see how that expands:\n\n1. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n   So now, we have NT17 and NT7.\n\n2. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n   We now have NT1 and NT58.\n\n3. NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\n   So, NT58 and NT41.\n\n4. NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15\n   Now, NT1 and NT15.\n\n5. NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n   So, NT3 and NT7.\n\n6. NT3 \u2192 't3'\n   That's a terminal, so we consume 't3'.\n\n7. NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n   Now, NT2 and NT19.\n\n8. NT2 \u2192 't5'\n   Another terminal.\n\n9. NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n   Now, NT4 and NT30.\n\n10. NT4 \u2192 't2' (I think, looking back, NT4 is not directly a terminal, wait, let's check the rules.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the rules, I need to make sure. Not all NTs have direct terminals, so I have to track whether they can produce terminal symbols. For example, NT4 might lead to something else, but in the given grammar, some of them do lead to terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. Neither 5 nor 36 are terminals yet. So, I might have to go deeper.\n\nHmm, perhaps taking this step-by-step approach is getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to use a method akin to parsing, starting from the leaves and working towards the root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production in CNF requires two steps, each consuming two symbols and producing one or two. So, for a string of length n, it's generated in n-1 steps since each production reduces the number of symbols by one.\n\nWait, but the string has 24 symbols. So the parse tree would have a certain structure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the string as being built by the grammar through a series of non-terminals and terminals, and check if each step conforms to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to structure this.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nEach non-terminal production leads into more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, every production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, every step is either combining two non-terminals or terminating with a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a series of terminals, each possibly from a production rule.\n\nLet me think of the given string as t2 t0 t0 t6 t1 t6 t6 t0 t2 t0 t6 t3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t4 t4 t2 t2 t5 t4 t1 t0.\n\nThat's 24 terminals. So, the parse tree would have 24 -1 = 23 splits. Each split corresponds to a production.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can see whether each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can map each terminal to the non-terminals that can produce them. For example, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can see which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5' (from NT2 \u2192 't5').\nNT3 \u2192 't3'.\nNT4 \u2192 't2' (but wait, looking at the rules, NT4 is: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. So perhaps NT4 doesn't produce a terminal. Let me check the rules again.)\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nNT4: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nHmm, so NT4 doesn't directly produce a terminal, but perhaps through other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me go through each rule and note which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5' (so it produces 't5')\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2' (Wait, no. Wait, in the rules provided, for NT4, I think I might have missed. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each production for NT... I see that some have terminals, others don't. Let me go:\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nWait, do any of the NT rules produce a terminal?

{"custom_id":"request-418","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t1 t1 t0 t2 t1 t1 t2 t1 t6 t2 t5 t4 t6 t1 t2 t0 t6 t6 t5 t5 t6 t3 t4 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The starting symbol is S. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice many production rules like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, which is two non-terminals. So the grammar is indeed in CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. I need to see if starting from S, I can derive this string by expanding non-terminals step by step. The approach would be to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nBut parsing such a long string manually would be complex. Maybe I can think about what the grammar produces by looking at the rules. Let's see some of the terminals provided:\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT7 can derive 't5' because one of its productions is NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48 and another is NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Wait, but in the grammar provided, I see that some non-terminals are mapped directly to terminals. For example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t5, NT4 \u2192 t2, NT52 \u2192 t2, NT32 \u2192 t1, and so on.\n\nWait, looking at the top-level productions:\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT17 also leads to 't5' because another production is NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, but wait, looking deeper, I see NT17 \u2192 t5. So S can produce t5? Let me check.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 can be broken down as NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Then NT17 can lead to 't5' directly because one of the productions is NT17 \u2192 t5. So S can generate 't5' through S \u2192 NT28 NT17, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, NT17 \u2192 t5, and NT7 could also be a terminal. Wait, but wait, NT7 has a production that can end with 't5' as well.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, check which non-terminals lead to terminals directly. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 has a production NT7 \u2192 t5.\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT48 \u2192 t1\n- NT32 \u2192 t1\n- NT54 \u2192 t3\n- NT5 \u2192 t43, but wait, t43 isn't a terminal, that's another non-terminal. Hmm, so that might not be useful directly.\n\nSo the terminals we can easily produce are t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, but some non-terminals produce other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t1 t1 t0... So let's see how t1 and t0 could fit into the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t0 is produced by NT0. How does NT0 derive? Looking through the productions:\n\nNT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 NT29 NT54, but then NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36 and NT54 \u2192 NT29 NT52, which seems recursive. Wait, another production is NT0 \u2192 t5, so if NT0 can be t5, then in the production S \u2192 NT28 NT17, if NT17 \u2192 t5 and NT28 \u2192 something else, but let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and how they are derived.\n\nFrom the grammar, terminals are the ones with productions ending in 't' followed by a number, like t0, t1, t2, etc. So let's list all terminals and their sources:\n\n- t0 from NT0 when it can directly produce t5? Wait, wait, looking at the productions, I see NT0 \u2192 t5. So if NT0 can produce t5, that's one way. But to get t0, do I have any production that ends in t0?\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t0. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps NT15 \u2192 t0. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7, and NT3 \u2192 t3, but wait, no. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7 \u2192 t3 NT7.\n\nBut NT7 can be directly t5, so NT15 \u2192 t3 t5, which is t3 t5, but that's not t0. Hmm, maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can produce t0, but in the given grammar, the only terminal directly produced is t0 from NT0 \u2192 t5? Wait, that's confusing. Wait no, NT0 produces t5 directly. So NT0 cannot produce t0 directly.\n\nWait, but the string includes t0, but in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce t0? Because looking through, I don't see any production that produces t0 except in the case where NT15 \u2192 t0? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the grammar's production rules, I see NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7. Now, NT3 \u2192 t3, and NT7 can be t5. So NT15 \u2192 t3 NT7 \u2192 t3 t5. No t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through all the productions again.\n\nWait, I see NT0 \u2192 t5, so t0 isn't directly produced. Hmm, that's a problem because the string has t0, so if the grammar can't produce t0, then the string can't be generated. Unless t0 is produced by some other rule, perhaps indirectly through recursion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT29 NT54 (prod1)\nNT0 \u2192 t5 (prod2)\n\nSo from NT0, you get t5. No direct way to get t0.\n\nWait, maybe t0 is produced indirectly through some other path. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce t0, which in turn can produce t0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe in the grammar, t0 is from NT29, let's see:\n\nLooking at NT29's productions: NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36, NT29 \u2192 NT30 NT13, NT40 \u2192 NT47 NT11, NT57 \u2192 NT12 NT36.\n\nWait, but none of these seem to directly produce t0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t0 is produced through something else. Wait, perhaps via NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44, but that leads to other non-terminals.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, so all productions are left- or right- context free. So I can parse the string starting from the start symbol S and see if each symbol can be expanded step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t1 t1 t0 t2 t1 t1 t2 t1 t6 t2 t5 t4 t6 t1 t2 t0 t6 t6 t5 t5 t6 t3 t4 t6`.\n\nThat's 24 symbols, so the derivation would require starting from S and expanding into these 24 terminals. Each step would increase the number of non-terminals by replacing a single non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The total number of symbols increases until it matches the string length.\n\nWait, but for a CFG in CNF, the derivation length n-1 steps for a string of n terminals, which in this case would be 23 steps. That's a lot, but perhaps I can find a pattern or use a parsing table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to match the string by breaking it down into possible subparts.\n\nLet's look at the string and see if any of the grammar rules match long sequences or parts of the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check the presence of t0. Since we can't directly get t0 from S, maybe through some non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, how is t0 generated? Looking at the rules, perhaps it's produced by some"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-436","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. CNF grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals, except for the base cases where a symbol can go to a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's in CNF because all the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or terminals. However, some rules end with terminals, like NT17 -> 't3', which I think means that NT17 is a terminal symbol and can directly produce 't3'.\n\nThe string we need to check is: `t1 t2 t1 t3 t5 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6 t1 t3 t2 t6 t4 t5 t5 t5 t2 t4 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1`.\n\nThat's a long string of t0 to t6. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nI think the best way is to construct a parse tree or follow the substitutions step by step, possibly using the leftmost derivation method.\n\nLet me start by identifying how the grammar produces the start symbol, which is S.\n\nFrom the grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't1' and ends with 't1', so let's see if S can generate these.\n\nWait, S is NT28 NT17. So, NT28 must derive to t1, and NT17 must derive to t1?\n\nWait, NT17's production is:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' \n\nSo, NT17 is a terminal, and it can only produce 't5'. But in the string, the first token is 't1', so S \u2192 NT28 NT17 would produce 't1' only if NT17 is somehow part of it, but that's not the case here because NT17 directly produces 't5'. So, is there any production where NT17 can derive to more than one symbol, thus allowing for interleaving to get 't1'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check all the productions for NT17.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17's productions are:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nAre there any others? It doesn't seem so. So NT17 can only be 't5', which doesn't match the first 't1' in the string. That already suggests a problem because S directly leads to NT28 and NT17. So the string must start with NT28's production followed by NT17's, which is 't5', but the string starts with 't1' perhaps multiple times.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't1 t2 t1 t3 t5 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6 t1 t3 t2 t6 t4 t5 t5 t5 t2 t4 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1'.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't1', and the second is 't2', etc. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. Identify which non-terminals can produce each token in the string.\n\n2. Starting from S, see if we can break down the string into parts that match the productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's better to look for the highest-level productions and see how they can break down the string.\n\nBut let me see the structure:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo the string must be the concatenation of what NT28 produces and NT17 produces.\n\nSince NT17 -> 't5', the last part of the string must end with 't5'. But looking at the given string, the end is 't0 t1', so that's a problem because NT17 can't produce 't0' or 't1'. Wait, that's a big issue.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting NT17's productions. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'.\n\nSo NT17 can only derive into 't5', which is a single terminal. Therefore, the string must end with 't5'. But the given string ends with 't0 t1', which is 't0' followed by 't1'. So that doesn't match. That would mean the string can't be generated by this grammar because the last symbol doesn't match.\n\nBut I should make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me see the entire derivation again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can produce more than two symbols because in CNF, perhaps we can derive via multiple steps, but S is a single symbol derivation to NT28 NT17. So, the first step is to get NT28's expansion and NT17's expansion.\n\nGiven that, the string must be the concatenation of NT28's expansion and NT17's expansion. Since NT17 can only produce 't5', the string must end with 't5'. Let me check the given string:\n\nThe string is: t1 t2 t1 t3 t5 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6 t1 t3 t2 t6 t4 t5 t5 t5 t2 t4 t2 t4 t1 t0 t1.\n\nWait, the last token is 't1', not 't5', which suggests that NT17 can't produce that. So that's a conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding NT17. Let me check the productions again to be sure. Are there any other productions for NT17?\n\nLooking at the production list:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nThat's the only production. So yes, NT17 is a terminal that only produces 't5'. Thus, the string must end with 't5'.\n\nLooking at the string: ends with t0 t1. Which are 't0' and 't1', so that's definitely a problem. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar because S produces NT28 NT17, which must end with 't5', but the given string ends with different tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding which symbols are terminals and non-terminals. Let me clarify that.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, non-terminals generate other non-terminals, and terminals are the atomic symbols (like 't0', 't1', etc.) So, in this grammar, symbols like NT17 are non-terminals. Their productions determine what they can generate.\n\nBut in the production NT17 -> 't5', that would mean that NT17 is a non-terminal that can produce a single terminal symbol 't5'. Therefore, any occurrence of NT17 in the string must be replaced by 't5'.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (something) t5.\n\nTherefore, the string must end with 't5'. However, the given string ends with 't0 t1', which means that the last symbol is 't1', which is different from 't5'. Therefore, the string cannot be derived from S in this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong in reading the productions. Have I perhaps misread the grammar rules where some NT's can produce multiple symbols?\n\nLet me check another example to confirm. For instance, NT7 \u2192 NT28 NT7. Wait, that can't be because 't5' is a terminal, and NT7 is non-terminal. So NT7 can generate more non-terminals.\n\nWait, but how does the string end with 't1'? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the production for NT17 can be part of a larger derivation, but no, if NT17 \u2192 't5', then it only contributes to a single token in the string. So if the string ends with 't1', then it can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding which symbol is derived when. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me try to structure the parse as follows.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t0, t1, etc., and each token in the string must be either a terminal or the result of a derivation starting from S.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of what NT28 generates and what NT17 generates.\n\nAs established, NT17 generates 't5'. Therefore, the string must end with 't5'. Let me check the string provided: it ends with 't0 t1', so that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the grammar rules. Let me check if any non-terminals can generate multiple terminals, such that the overall string can have 't1' as the last symbol.\n\nWait, looking at other productions, maybe NT1 can generate 't1'.

{"custom_id":"request-452","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break down how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar, making certain parsing algorithms more efficient, like the CYK algorithm. But I'm not sure if I need to use CYK here, but knowing the structure might help.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that it's indeed in CNF. All the production rules are either converting a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a single terminal. No rules have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side, and each terminal is a single symbol. So that's good.\n\nNow, the task is to check whether the string `t2 t3 t4 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t5 t1 t6 t0 t4 t3 t3 t2 t0 t0 t4 t6 t2 t2 t2 t2 t3 t2` is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst thing I think of is that since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for the string must be a binary tree, meaning the parse tree has a certain structure where each node has exactly two children. The length of the string will give me some initial insight\u2014since each production can produce two symbols (terminals or non-terminals), but terminals can't produce further, perhaps the length must be a power of 2? Let me check the string length.\n\nThe given string has 27 tokens. 27 is not a power of 2 (since 2^4=16, 2^5=32). Hmm, that's an interesting point. Wait, but in the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the start symbol will produce two non-terminals. Each of those could produce two non-terminals, and so on. So the number of terminal symbols should be a power of 2. Because each step doubles the number of symbols. So if I start with 1 symbol, next step 2, then 4, 8, 16, 32... So the number of terminals should be 2^k for some k.\n\nBut the string has 27 terminals, which isn't a power of 2. So that immediately makes me think that the string can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes you can have a derivation that results in a string which isn't a power of 2 if you have left recursion or other structures, but in this case, the grammar is in CNF, which typically means each step produces exactly two symbols, so the length should be a power of 2.\n\nSo if the string length isn't a power of 2, it can't be generated. Therefore, regardless of the specific symbols, the string can't be generated because 27 isn't a power of 2.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The example given in the problem has a string length of 27. 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32. 27 is in between, so yes, it's not a power of 2. So the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look more into the structure of the grammar to see if some specific paths can produce a longer string, but I'm pretty confident that the length must be a power of 2 in a properly derived CNF grammar.\n\nSo, given that the length is 27, which isn't a power of 2, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side. The start symbol is S, and the string is composed of terminals (t0, t1, etc.) and non-terminals (like S, NT57, etc.). \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT57 and NT28. So the string must start with the expansions of NT57 and NT28. Let me check the string starts with 't0 t5', which looks like two terminals. I'll need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce these.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT27 can produce t6 and t1. Hmm, not matching. Wait, the first part is 't0 t5', so maybe NT15 and NT29? Wait, let me check the initial productions more carefully.\n\nWait, NT27 has productions like NT17 and NT27, which leads to t6 and t1. But the string starts with t0. Looking back, NT30 can produce t4 and t3, but not t0. NT29 can produce t5 and t5 or t4 and t0. Wait, NT29 has production: NT29 -> NT0 NT36, and looking at the terminals, there's NT15 -> t0 and NT36 -> t4, but that's for NT15.\n\nWait, maybe NT0 can produce t5. Looking at the rules, NT0 -> NT3 NT5, which are NT3 and NT5. NT3 isn't a terminal either. Hmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree step by step. The string is long, but let me try to break it down.\n\nThe string is: t0 t5 t5 t1 t6 t1 t2 t1 t0 t0 t2 t0 t6 t3 t2 t4 t6 t1 t1 t0 t2 t1 t4 t1 t2 t6.\n\nLet me see where each part could come from. Starting with S->NT57 NT28. So the first two non-terminals to expand are NT57 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT57's rules: NT57 can go to NT19 NT9 or NT13 NT30. So the first part of the string starts with t0 t5. Let's see:\n\nIf NT57 -> NT19 NT9, then NT19 and NT9 would produce t0 and t5. Looking at NT19: NT19 -> NT4 NT48, but in the terminals, we don't see NT48. Alternatively, NT19 has production NT7 NT48. NT7's rules include NT2 NT19, but I don't think that's helpful. Maybe NT9?\n\nWait, looking at NT9: NT9 can go to NT21 NT9 (which is a recursion) or NT15 NT20. Let's see if NT15 or NT20 can produce t0 or t5.\n\nLooking at NT15: NT15 -> NT3 NT7. NT3 is NT26 NT40 and so on. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, looking back at the start symbol S->NT57 NT28, let's consider other possibilities. NT57 could also be NT13 NT30. So NT13 and NT30.\n\nNT13 has production -> NT1 NT7. So t1 could come from NT1, but wait, NT1 isn't a terminal. It's a non-terminal. Hmm. Or maybe NT13's production is NT45 NT26. But NT45 and NT26 would produce other things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing the production NT57 -> NT5 NT3, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, looking at the rules again: NT57 has several productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the given string might not be the output of this grammar because each production leads to a certain way of expanding, and the given string's structure doesn't match any possible combination. But I'm not sure. It's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother approach: let's try to parse the string step by step. Given that the string is a series of terminals, we can see which non-terminals can expand into these sequences.\n\nStarting with S -> NT57 NT28.\n\nThe first part of the string is t0 t5. Let's see if any of NT57's or NT28's expansions can start with t0 t5.\n\nLooking at NT57:\n\nNT57 can be NT13 NT30 or NT5 NT3.\n\nSuppose NT57 expands to NT5 NT3:\n\nNT5: Looking at rules, NT5->NT43 NT24. Doesn't help because t43 and t24 are non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, NT57 -> NT5 NT3. Then NT5 could produce another NT, but I don't see a terminal t0 or t5 directly.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the way. Let's try a different approach. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't0'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT15 -> NT3 NT7. NT3 is not terminal, so no.\n\nNT29 -> NT0 NT36. NT0 is a non-terminal that can produce 't5'. Wait, let me check NT0 rules: NT0->NT3 NT5. NT3 is NT26 NT40, which is still not terminals.\n\nHmm, maybe looking for where 't0' is produced. Looking at the rules, NT32->NT46 NT1, but in the string, we have 't0's. Wait, in the string, there's 't0' several times. Let me check where 't0' appears as a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't0' is mentioned only as NT29->t0 t5. So NT29 can produce 't0' and 't5' when you expand it. Wait, wait: NT29's rule is NT0 NT36, right? But NT0 is a non-terminal. So maybe NT29 being NT0 NT36, which then need to produce 't0' and 't5'? \n\nWait, let me clarify. If a non-terminal like NT29 can produce a t0 followed by a t5, then maybe that's the way to go. Let's see:\n\nNT29 -> NT0 NT36 (from the rules): NT29 has production NT0 NT36. So if NT0 can produce 't5' and NT36 can produce 't0', then that would generate 't5 t0', but that's not matching. Wait, no: NT0 is a non-terminal whose production is NT3 NT5. So it doesn't directly produce a terminal.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's try another angle.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t0 t5 t5. So the first two terminals are t0 and t5. So if S produces NT57 and NT28, then perhaps one of them produces t0 and the other t5, but that can't be because in the context of a two-symbol production, both must be terminals or one terminal and one non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, because S produces NT57 and NT28, each of those non-terminals will expand into a sequence of non-terminals, but their expansion might produce the terminals at the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t0 being generated by a non-terminal that eventually leads to t0, and t5 by another. Let me check where t0 and t5 are produced.\n\nLooking at NT29: production NT0 NT36, which may produce 't0' if NT0 or NT36 produce 't0'. But NT0 is NT3 NT5. So maybe when NT3 expands, it could produce 't0'? Let's see NT3's production: NT3 is NT26 NT40, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce t0.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT52: NT20 NT36. If NT20 can produce t0, but I don't think so.\n\n- NT29: NT0 NT36. If NT0 could produce 't0', but I don't think NT0's production does that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the rules again. Maybe somewhere a non-terminal directly expands to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT27 has production NT17 NT27 and NT5 NT53. Hmm.\n\n- NT28 has production NT7 NT21.

The grammar consists of a set of production rules that define how non-terminal symbols (like S, NT57, NT17, etc.) can be rewritten into sequences of other symbols. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, which likely represent the specific symbols in the string we're testing.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of these terminal symbols. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except possibly the start symbol. Looking at the rules given, the left-hand side (LHS) of all production rules is a single non-terminal symbol, confirming it's in CNF.\n\nIn CNF, each derivation step reduces the number of symbols by applying a production rule. Each production rule directly generates two symbols. This implies that the derived strings have lengths that are powers of two, but with the start symbol S, since each step doubles the length.\n\nLet's check the length of the string: it's 27 symbols long. Since 2^5=32 and 2^4=16, and 27 isn't a power of two, this indicates that the string could not have been generated by a typical CNF grammar where each production adds exactly one symbol on each side. However, this alone doesn't necessarily mean the string is invalid because some rules might lead to more complex length combinations, though in practice, in a proper derivation, each step in CNF would generate a string whose length is a power of two. \n\nWait, that might not be exactly correct. Let me think: in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. So each application of a production increases the number of non-terminals by adding one more, but the actual length in terms of terminal symbols is different. Actually, the length in terminal symbols can vary according to the number of derivations.\n\nWait no, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Each application of a CNF production rule increases the number of symbols by 1 (from one non-terminal to two). So starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, the length after each step would be:\n\n- Step 1 (S): 1 non-terminal, which can become two, so length 1 in non-terminals becomes 2. But in terms of terminal symbols, it depends on the productions.\n\nHold on, perhaps I should think of each step in terms of how the string of symbols grows.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a parse tree to see if the given string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to use dynamic programming (CYK algorithm) for parsing, but since the string is a bit long (27 symbols), that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can start by trying to see how the string can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols in the string, I need to match them against the possible productions. Each step in the derivation using CNF will produce exactly two symbols, so I should check how the string can be split into parts that correspond to the production rules.\n\nWait, the string is \"t6 t3 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t4 t6 t3 t5 t2 t6 t4 t5 t0 t5 t2 t0 t1 t4 t6 t2 t0 t0 t6 t0\". Let me count the number of 't's. It's 27, which is problematic because each production in CNF adds symbols in such a way that the number of terminal symbols is variable, but for a string generated by a CFG in CNF, the length must be a product of the derivations. However, the string's length is 27, which is not a power of two, but in CFGs, the length can be any number, not just powers of two, as each production can affect different parts of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's instead try to see if the string can follow a derivation by considering the possible splits.\n\nEach production in the grammar splits a non-terminal into two parts. So, the entire string can be considered as starting from S and being split into two parts, then each of those can be split again, etc., until all are terminals.\n\nSo, the string is 27 symbols, so maybe 27 is 2^4 + something, but that's unnecessary. Alternatively, perhaps it's more straightforward to look for the possible ways to split.\n\nLet me look for the productions that generate these terminals. First, let's see which non-terminals produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, any NT ending with -> tX is a terminal, where X is a number. So, for example, NT9 -> 't3'? Let me check more closely.\n\nWait, in the last lines, I see rules like NT4 -> 't2', NT11 -> 't2', NT0 -> 't5', etc. So each terminal symbol corresponds to certain non-terminals.\n\nI can try to parse the string by starting from the end, checking possible splits from the end down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal appears in the productions and whether the possible splits can produce this string.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to see if the string has a structure that can be decomposed into pairs according to the rules. But given the length is 27, which is odd, which complicates that because each step of the CFG in CNF splits into two, so the length after each step should be even unless it's from the start.\n\nWait, but wait: the start symbol S is a single non-terminal. Let's consider the string's length:\n\n- The start symbol S is length 1 non-terminal.\n- Each step replaces a non-terminal with two, so the length becomes 2, then next step can apply to any of those, making it 3, or maybe split into 4, etc.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each application of a production replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols, which could be non-terminals or terminals. Each derivation step increases the count by 1 non-terminal. So the length of the string in non-terminals increases by 1 each time. Thus, the total number of symbols (both terminals and non-terminals) increases by the number of productions applied.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too detailed. Maybe a better way is to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the possible production rules.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for sequences of terminals that can be generated from a single rule. For example, if a production rule NT57 -> NT13 NT47, and NT13 and NT47 have their own productions leading to terminals, then a possible string after two steps would be from NT57 -> NT13 (which could become something) and NT47 (something else). But this is getting too abstract without knowing exact productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find which non-terminals directly produce each 't' in the string.\n\nLooking for the rules that lead to each terminal:\n\n- 't0' is in NT0's production: NT0 -> 't5'\n- 't1' in NT1's production (somewhere, I haven't found it yet)\nWait, looking back: in the last part, I see NT11 -> 't2', NT1 -> 't5'; looking through the rules, let me search for NT producing a specific tX.\n\nLooking for rules that produce 'tX' as terminals:\n\n- From the list, I see that some non-terminals produce 't3', like NT24 -> 't2', but wait, let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, I see that:\n\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't2'\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't3' (wait: from the rule, I think NT96 -> maybe not in the given rules. Looking, the rule at the end has NT9 leading to 't3'? Let me check:\n\nYes, looking further down, there's NT3 -> 't3', NT6 -> 't4', NT9 -> 't3' (wait, no) -- Wait, let me check all rules.\n\nWait, looking through the entire rule list, here are the rules where the RHS is a terminal:\n\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't2'\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- Additionally:\n\nWait, looking closely, some rules have one or two terminals on the RHS. For example:\n\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT23 -> 't7' (Wait, no -- let me check actual rules.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

The string provided is: `t3 t4 t5 t5 t1 t1 t0 t1 t2 t5 t2 t4 t6 t3 t0 t1 t4 t4 t6 t3 t4 t1 t2 t0 t0 t0 t5`.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see that all the rules indeed start with a non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. So the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nNext, to determine if the string is in the language generated by this grammar, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for testing membership in a CFG given in CNF. However, since the string is quite long (26 tokens), manually applying CYK would be time-consuming and error-prone. But maybe I can find a pattern or backtrack through the grammar to see if the string can be derived.\n\nLet me list out the symbols in the string for clarity:\n1. t3\n2. t4\n3. t5\n4. t5\n5. t1\n6. t1\n7. t0\n8. t1\n9. t2\n10. t5\n11. t2\n12. t4\n13. t6\n14. t3\n15. t0\n16. t1\n17. t4\n18. t4\n19. t6\n20. t3\n21. t4\n22. t1\n23. t2\n24. t0\n25. t0\n26. t0\n27. t5\n\nI notice that the string consists only of terminals, so it's a sequence of terminal symbols. I need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S by successively replacing non-terminals with terminal sequences according to the rules.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first step would be to try to find a way to derive t3, which is one of the terminals.\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT17 has other possibilities, but let's see. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT17 has a production rule NT17 -> NT1 NT58, but also NT17 \u2192 't5', which is specified in the end where NT52 is 't2' and so on. Wait, no\u2014looking at the production rules, some NTs directly map to terminals.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to list the rules and see which non-terminals directly map to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT19 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT24 \u2192 't1' (Wait, NT24\u2192NT53 NT43, and then NT53\u2192't2' and NT43\u2192't2', so it's t2 t2, which is 't2t2')\n- Wait, no, actually, in the given rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking more carefully, for example:\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1' (because NT32 \u2192 NT15 NT3, and NT15 \u2192 't0' and NT3 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, in the end, NT3 is 't3'. So actually, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the end of the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT19 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo these non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nSo NT17 can produce t5, NT19 \u2192 t3, NT20 \u2192 t4, etc.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is t3. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals produce t3? Looking at the rules, NT19 \u2192 t3, NT3 \u2192 t3, and from the start symbol S, I can see that S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nHmm. Let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe first token is t3. Let's see where that can come from. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo either NT19 or NT3 can produce t3 as the first symbol.\n\nLet's assume it's NT19 \u2192 t3. Then we move to the next symbol, which is t4.\n\nLooking at the productions for t4:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 t4\n- NT28 \u2192 't3'? Wait, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so it's not a terminal. Wait, no, checking the rules:\n\nLooking at the first production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Hmm, not a terminal. So which rule produces t4?\n\nLooking back, NT20 \u2192 t4, NT52 \u2192 t2, NT32 \u2192 t1, etc.\n\nWait, in the given rules, NT20 \u2192 t4.\n\nSo the second token is t4. So from S \u2192 NT28 NT17, the next step would be to produce the right-hand side of S, which is NT28 NT17. So NT28 and NT17 need to produce t3 and t4 in that order.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals. So each symbol in the string is a result of a production step where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can determine the possible start symbol by seeing which rules can produce the entire string.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo to generate the string, S would expand to NT28 NT17. Then, both NT28 and NT17 will need to produce sequences of terminals starting with the first symbol of the string, which is t3.\n\nBut in reality, the production process is more hierarchical. So perhaps it's better to model the string as a sequence of terminals, each coming from the right-hand side of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the string as a series of t's and numbers and see how the grammar can generate them step by step.\n\nWait, I'm a bit lost. Maybe I can look for the presence of certain production rules that map directly to these terminals and see if the string can be derived.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\n1. t3\n2. t4\n3. t5\n4. t5\n5. t1\n6. t1\n7. t0\n8. t1\n9. t2\n10. t5\n11. t2\n12. t4\n13. t6\n14. t3\n15. t0\n16. t1\n17. t4\n18. t4\n19. t6\n20. t3\n21. t4\n22. t1\n23. t2\n24. t0\n25. t0\n26. t0\n27. t5\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3. As mentioned earlier, that could come from NT19 or NT3.\n\nLet's try NT3 \u2192 t3. Then NT28 needs to produce t4. So looking for NT28 \u2192 t4. But from the rules, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT17 needs to produce t4, but looking at the rules, NT17 \u2192 t5 or NT1 and NT58. But t5 doesn't match t4. So that might not work. So perhaps NT19 \u2192 t3 first.\n\nLet's go with NT19 \u2192 t3. Then NT28 NT17 needs to produce t4 followed by t5, t5, etc. Wait, no\u2014the string starts with t3, t4, t5, t5, etc. So after t3 (which is NT19), perhaps NT28 \u2192 something that starts with t4.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Here, the terminals are t0 to t5, and the non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers or letters, like NT57, NT30, etc.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which is defined as NT28 NT17. So, any string generated by this grammar must start with whatever NT28 and NT17 produce. Wait, but in the given string, the first symbol is t0. Hmm, so does NT28 or NT17 produce t0? Let me check the production rules.\n\nLooking at NT28: its productions are NT17 NT7 and other combinations. Oh, there's also NT28 -> NT14 NT33, but does any NT produce a terminal directly? Scanning through, I see that most non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals. But wait, there are some NT's that produce terminals. For example, NT32 -> NT10 NT3, but I don't see any NT directly producing t0. Wait, maybe T0 is produced by some non-terminal?\n\nLooking again, T0 is not directly produced by any NT. Wait, the grammar doesn't seem to have any NT producing T0. Wait, is T0 a terminal? Because in the string, the first symbol is t0. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps T0 is a non-terminal that can produce t0? No, no, in the grammar, the production rules are for non-terminals (NT followed by a number or letter). The actual terminals are the t's. So, in this grammar, I don't see any NT rule producing t0, t1, etc. So that's a problem because the string starts with t0, but there's no rule that allows NT's to produce t0. That suggests the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the production rules. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT producing T0. The NT's eventually derive into various NTs, but in the process, do they generate t0? For example, NT15 -> NT3 NT7, and NT3 -> NT19 NT55, and so on. None of these seem to produce any Ts. T0 is only present in the string as a terminal, which isn't defined in any production.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a path where some NT eventually produces t0. Let me track down all NTs and see if any can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the production rules, T0 is in NT30 and NT57. For example, NT30 -> NT44 NT13. Does any of these lead to T0? NT44 is in NT44 -> NT21 NT14, and NT14 is in NT14 -> NT53 NT5, etc. I don't see T0 appearing anywhere. Similarly, NT30 also has NT44 NT13, but again, no T0. Hmm.\n\nWait, what about NT57? NT57 has two rules: NT30 NT5 and NT19 NT9. NT30 has no direct path to T0, and NT19 has NT2 NT15, but T0 isn't produced there either. Wait, NT15 is in NT15 -> NT3 NT7. No T0 again.\n\nWait, I'm missing something. Maybe I should try to see how the string is built up from the top-down, using the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT28 NT17. So, the first step is to expand NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So, when we expand NT28 at the start, we get NT17 NT7. Similarly, NT17 has productions like NT1 NT58 or NT27 NT27, etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, after S, the first symbol is t0. So, if NT28 produces t0 and some other non-terminals, then that's the start. But looking at NT28's productions, none of them directly produce t0. So, maybe through a chain of expansions.\n\nWait, let's try to see how t0 could be produced by expanding S.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nNT28 can be replaced by NT17 NT7. So, S \u2192 (NT17 NT7) \u2192 (something) something else.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t0, so one of the expansions must lead to t0.\n\nWait, perhaps NT28 eventually leads to t0 through some chain. Let's explore the possible derivation paths.\n\nFor example, NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5.\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23.\n\nWait, NT12 is in NT12 -> NT19 NT41 or NT29 NT13.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's track it all.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nNT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT29 NT13\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT19 NT48\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n\nBut NT30 is another complex non-terminal that expands into other NTs. This seems like a dead end because I can't see T0 popping up here.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the production NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT7 has options like NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30.\n\nIf we choose NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, then:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17) (NT7) \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 so at this point, we have NT17 followed by NT2 and NT19.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 can expand into NT27 NT27 or other options.\n\nWait, maybe this is taking too long. Let me think if there's a better way.\n\nPerhaps the first step is to check if the string can be broken down into the start symbol S followed by some expansion.\n\nWait, the string starts with t0 t2 t3... So, the first symbol is t0. But according to the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t0. That suggests the string cannot be generated because the first symbol is a terminal that's not produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nBut let me make sure. Is T0 a terminal? Yes, because in the grammar, all the rules are between non-terminals (NTs). The Ts are terminals, meaning they cannot be expanded further. Since in the string, t0 appears as the first symbol, but in the grammar, there's no production rule that starts with t0. Therefore, the grammar cannot derive a string that starts with t0.\n\nWait, is that right? Because in a CNF grammar, only the top symbol can be a terminal or a non-terminal. The start symbol is always a non-terminal, because S \u2192 NT... so S must expand into non-terminals. So any string derived from S must start with what S produces, which are non-terminals. Therefore, the initial symbol in any string produced by this grammar must be a non-terminal that can expand into a sequence of Ts.\n\nSo, since the string starts with t0, which is a terminal, the grammar cannot produce that string, because the starting symbol S is a non-terminal, and its expansions must consist of non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol in any generated string should be a non-terminal that can derive into t0, but as per the grammar, there's no such rule.\n\nWait, unless there's a way that a non-terminal chain of expansions leads to a terminal t0. But let me check the NTs again.\n\nWait, looking through the production rules, some rules include t3, t4, etc. For example, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36, but wait, do any NTs produce t0? Let me check all NT rules again.\n\nLooking in the entire list of production rules, the only NTs that have terminals in their productions are those where the RHS includes a terminal. However, the terminals are t0 to t5, but none of the NTs seem to directly produce t0 except maybe when a chain of expansions leads to t0.\n\nWait, let's see. Is any NT producing t0 somewhere as a direct or indirect result? For example, let's see if NT21 can somehow produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n\nSo, this is a cycle between NT21 and NT35, which goes into NT6 and beyond"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It consists of a series of production rules for terminals ('t' followed by numbers) and non-terminals (abbreviated as NT<number>). The start symbol is S, which immediately expands to NT28 and NT17. My job is to see if the string can be derived from these productions.\n\nLet me start by looking for the initial expansion. S -> NT28 NT17. So, the first two symbols after S would correspond to the productions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 is defined as NT17 NT7. So, after the first NT28 (which becomes NT17 NT7), we have NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, the string starts with \"t5 t2 ...\". Let me map the initial steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT28 NT17\n   - NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n   - So, the first two non-terminals after 'S ' would be NT17 and NT7.\n   \nBut the actual string starts with t5. Looking at the options, maybe I should look for how NT28 and NT17 are expanded. But perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which parses strings to see if they belong to a CFG. But since this might be complex, I can try breaking down the steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t5 t2 t6 t2 t6 t5 t3 t6 t6 t6 t4 t2 t3 t0 t2 t3 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t2 t6 t2.\n\nFirst, the entire string must be generated from S. Let's see the initial expansion:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nSo after expanding NT28, the next symbol is NT7. Looking at NT7, the productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30.\n\nNext, the first 't5' in the string. Looking at the grammar, 't5' is a terminal. Let me find where 't5' appears as a production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find 't5' as NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7, but wait, that's for NT15. Additionally, 't5' is directly a result of NT3, as NT3\u2192 't3'? Wait, wait, let's check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, under NTxx, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 NT23 NT20 (wait, perhaps not the best way).\n\nWait, the grammar includes:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list all the terminals. \n\nTerminals in the grammar are: all strings that end with 't' followed by a number. From the grammar:\n\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals:\n\nFrom the rules, any rule that ends in 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo the possible terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.\n\nWait, looking again, 't4' appears as a result of some NT productions, for example, NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26, but I'm not sure. Let me scan the grammar more carefully.\n\nYes, the terminals are:\n\n- t5: from NT29, NT0, NT48 (which becomes 't3'), etc. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT59? Wait, no. Let me list all rules where a terminal appears:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't3' in some rules? Wait, I'm confused. Looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the direct terminals:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo the terminals in the string are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.\n\nIn the provided string, I see t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 as follows:\n\nt5, t2, t6...

The initial string given is:\n\nString: `t5 t2 t6 t2 t6 t5 t3 t6 t6 t6 t4 t2 t3 t0 t2 t3 t1 t2 t1 t1 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t2 t6 t2`.\n\nBut wait, in the original problem statement, I should check whether 't6' is allowed because I can't find 't6' anywhere in the grammar rules. Because the terminals are only up to t5.\n\nSo 't6' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, any 't6' in the string must be part of a non-terminal's expansion. But in the given string, the substring contains 't6's. Let's see, it appears as the third element: t5, then t2, then t6. \n\nSince 't6' isn't a terminal in the grammar, it can't appear directly. Therefore, the first three tokens would require that 't5' is derived, followed by 't2' and 't6'. But 't6' can't be a terminal. So this might already be a sign that the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but the string provided includes 't6' in the middle. So perhaps the problem is that 't6' isn't defined in the grammar as a terminal, meaning it's part of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nIf that's the case, then the string has 't6', which is not a terminal. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But I need to be careful because maybe the grammar includes 't6' as part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nLet me check: Do any non-terminals derive 't6'? Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see 't6' as any of the productions. For example, looking at the rules, the only possible terminal is t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5.\n\nSo 't6' is not a terminal and not part of any non-terminal definition in the grammar. Therefore, the presence of 't6' means the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So the answer is 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nLooking through each production, the RHSs of all rules either have non-terminals or the terminals I've listed. I don't see any 't6' in any of them. For example, NT9 produces 't3' (looking at some rule like NT9 \u2192 't3'), but no 't6's.\n\nSo, the string has 't6's, which are invalid. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Hence, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar follows this structure, so that's good. The string to check is in terms of terminals t0 to t6, so the grammar's productions seem to correspond correctly.\n\nI need to parse the string starting from the top of the grammar and see if it can derive to the string. Let me start by looking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the initial symbols are NT28 and NT17. NT17 is a non-terminal, so we'll need to replace it.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3, which corresponds to the production NT27 \u2192 t6, because in the grammar NT27 can go to t6. But looking at the grammar, NT27 has productions:\n\nNT27 -> NT17 NT27\nNT27 -> NT4 NT3\nNT27 is a non-terminal, so it can't be a terminal itself. So the string starts with t3, which is another non-terminal. Wait, let me check the terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that terminals are t0 to t5 and possibly t6? Wait, the grammar entries have t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, 58, etc. Hmm, no, the string provided is \"t3 t4 t5...\". So it's a sequence of these terminals, except t58, t7, etc., which may come into play.\n\nWait, initial productions: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Let's break this down. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, for example. Wait, looking at NT28, the rule is:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17 becomes S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17\n\nWait, that seems a bit complex. Maybe it's easier to reverse-engineer the string, building a parse tree from the string upwards.\n\nThe string is 32 tokens long. Let's think about steps:\n\nEach production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. So starting from S, we'd have two non-terminals, each of which we'd replace step by step.\n\nBut since the grammar is pretty big, it's a challenge. Maybe a better approach is to look at the string and see if all the terminals in the string can be generated by non-terminals' productions that can lead to the string.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to reconstruct the parse tree starting from the string and seeing if it matches any structure in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with t3. From the grammar, which non-terminals produce t3?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t6 or NT4 NT3. Wait, NT4's productions are NT28 NT21 and others, so NT4 isn't a terminal. So, NT27 doesn't produce t3.\n\nLet me check all the grammar rules to see which non-terminals have t3 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through, NT13 has NT13 \u2192 NT45 NT26, but let me look for any production that ends with t3:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT6 is not a terminal, so NT6 in any production ends with t4 (NT6 \u2192 t4). \n\nWait, let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, for each rule, if it's B \u2192 a, then B is a non-terminal that produces a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t4\n- NT13 \u2192 t3?\nWait, checking NT13. The rules are NT13 \u2192 NT45 NT26, etc. Hmm, no, NT13 doesn't produce t3. Let me go through all the rules.\n\nLooking for B \u2192 a where a is a terminal:\n\nIn the provided grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t4\n- NT6 \u2192 t4 (in one rule, another nt6 is in another production)\nWait, looking at the provided productions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, is there a rule like NT6 \u2192 t4? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 is produced by: NT29 \u2192 NT7 NT53, which doesn't have a terminal. Hmm, wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT6 is actually being produced by some rules:\n\nWait, for example, NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT52. Hmm, but that's not a terminal. Wait, looking through the list, it seems that I might have missed some productions.\n\nLooking for terminals (t0, t1, etc.) as productions:\n\nFor instance:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 NT35 NT33, but looking further:\n\nWait, no, wait: Looking at the production NT14, which is 't4'?\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar:\n\nYes, several rules end with t0, t1, t2, etc.\n\nLet me list all non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2 (from somewhere)\nWait, let me parse each rule:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t4 (looking for NT6's production): Let me check.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLine 25: NT6 is not a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-504","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t5 t0 t0 t2 t3 t1 t4 t1 t1 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t1 t4 t6 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t0 t0 t6 t0 t2 t4 t6`. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The given grammar has productions with two non-terminals, so that's consistent. Also, the string consists of terminal symbols, which in this case seem to be tokens like 't0', 't1', etc. Each of these must have been derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe strategy here is to use the parsing method for CNF grammars, which is essentially performing a breadth-first search (BFS) expansion of the start symbol until we reach the string. Alternatively, we can model this as a derivation tree, ensuring that each step adheres to the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, let's break it down into individual tokens: t5, t0, t0, ..., up to t6. The total length is 31 tokens. Since each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, the number of steps needed should be roughly logarithmic, but considering the string length, the maximum height of the parse tree would be log2(31) \u2248 5 levels. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the start symbol S produces NT28 and NT17. So any valid derivation must start by expanding S into NT28 NT17. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded further until we reach terminals.\n\nFor example, NT28 can be split into NT17 and NT7 according to the rule S->NT28 NT17. Then NT17 can be split into NT1 and 't5' (from NT17->'t5'). Similarly, NT28 can go to NT7 and NT21, but another path is through NT7->NT2 NT19, which would go to 't3' and 't5'.\n\nLet me try building a parse tree step by step. Let's see if the string can be constructed by the given grammar.\n\nThe string starts with 't5', which from the grammar could be NT17's terminal. Looking at NT17's rules, one production is NT17->'t5'. So the first symbol 't5' can be derived from NT17. Similarly, the last symbol is 't6', which from the rules is produced by NT3 or NT36, both of which are non-terminals that eventually produce 't6'.\n\nTo start, S expands to NT28 NT17. So the first part of the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t5, t0, t1, etc. Let me map this.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT28 NT17\n   - Let's see what NT17 can produce. One production is NT17->'t5', which matches the first symbol. So after this step, we have:\n     - NT28 | 't5'\n\n2. Now expand NT28. NT28 has rules: NT28->NT17 NT7. Let's choose this first. Now NT17 can be 't5' again, which matches the next token, which is 't0'\u2014wait, no, the second token is 't0', not 't5'. Hmm, maybe I need to choose a different path for NT28.\n\nWait, perhaps in step 2, after NT28, we should look at the next token. The second token is 't0' which is in the grammar as NT0->'t0'. So maybe we need to see how 't0' gets produced.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0->'t5' and NT0->'t2'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I'm not seeing NT0->'t0' directly. Wait, let's check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the user's provided grammar, under NT15, there's a rule NT15->'t0'. But there's no NT0 node\u2014it seems that in the grammar, 't0' is produced by NT15. So 't0' must come from NT15.\n\nBut that would mean the start sequence would have to derive to NT15 somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Looking back, under the grammar rules, there's a production for NT15-> 't0'. So 't0' is generated by NT15. So perhaps the start symbol needs to expand through a path that reaches NT15.\n\nWait, but the start is S -> NT28 NT17. So for the string to start with 't5' from NT17, the next part must come from NT28, which is NT17 NT7. Let me try expanding NT28 to NT17 NT7.\n\nSo after S, we have NT17 (for the first 't5'), and then NT28 would expand into NT17 and NT7. Now the string starts as 't5' and the next part would be from NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach: try to walk through the string step by step, trying to match it with the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t0 t1 t2 t2 t3 t1 t4 t1 t1 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t1 t4 t6 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t0 t0 t6 t0 t2 t4 t6.\n\nWe can try to parse this as a leftmost derivation.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\n2. Now, we look at NT28 and NT17.\n\n   - NT17 can be 't5', which matches the first symbol. So we have 't5'. Now, the next symbol is t0.\n\n3. Now, after 't5', we need to expand the NT28 side. NT28 can be expanded, for example, to NT17 NT7.\n\n   - We've used up S's NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\n   - NT17 again can be 't5', which would give 't5 t5', but the next symbol is 't0', which doesn't match. So maybe this path is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, after 't5', maybe the NT28 should expand to another path.\n\nLooking at NT28's rules, there's another production: NT28->NT7 NT21. Perhaps this is the right path to generate 't0'.\n\nFrom NT28, using NT28->NT7 NT21, the first part after 't5' would be from NT7 and NT21.\n\n- NT7 can produce 't3' (via NT7->'t3'), and NT21 can produce 't0'. Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT21 can produce 't0'? No, in the grammar under NT15, there's NT15->'t0', but I don't see NT21 having that. Let me check.\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT21. There's NT21->'t0' under NT7? Wait, no.\n\nLooking again: under NT7's rules, one production is NT7->'t5'; another is NT7->NT2 NT19. Also, NT38->'t4' is another production.\n\nWait, perhaps NT21 can be derived from another rule. Oh, looking at the rules, there's NT21->'t0' under NT24. Wait, no, looking: NT21 has production NT21->'t4' from NT38->'t4', but that's in another context.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT21 can go to NT35 and NT2, which can then yield terminals. This is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of trying to parse the string symbol by symbol, perhaps I can check if each symbol can be derived from some non-terminal, considering the order in the string.\n\nThe string is 't5 t0 t1 t2 t2 t3 t1 t4 t1 t1 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t1 t4 t6 t5 t2 t5 t3 t4 t0 t0 t6 t0 t2 t4 t6'.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\n1: t5\n\n2: t0\n\n3: t1\n\n4: t2\n\n5: t2\n\n6: t3\n\n7: t1\n\n8: t4\n\n9: t1\n\n10: t1\n\n11: t3\n\n12: t6\n\n13: t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So all the productions here are in CNF because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string: `t3 t2 t4 t0 t0 t5 t4 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t4 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t2 t2 t4 t2 t4 t0 t5 t2 t6 t3 t4 t4 t1`. Let me count the tokens\u2014there are 37 tokens. Each token is a terminal like t3, t2, etc.\n\nThe grammar symbols include terminals like t0, t1, ..., t6, and non-terminals like S, NT57, NT48, and others. Wait, looking at the productions, I see symbols like NTxx, which are non-terminals. But in the string, I don't see any of these NT symbols; all are terminals. So perhaps S is the start symbol, and in the string, we need to derive this string starting from S.\n\nThe first step is to check if the entire string can be derived starting from S, using the given grammar.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. From S, according to the rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17, we need to derive a string starting with NT28 followed by NT17. But in the string, the first two tokens are t3 and t2. So we need to see if NT28 can derive t3 and t17 can derive t2.\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (from the grammar). So to derive t3 from NT28, perhaps NT28 first produces NT17 NT7, and then NT17 and NT7 can produce t3 in the end.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. Let's see, how do these non-terminals resolve to terminals?\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to approach this as a string derivation problem using the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if they can be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me parse the string step by step.\n\nt3 t2 t4 t0 t0 t5 t4 t3 t4 t5 t1 t3 t4 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t2 t2 t4 t2 t4 t0 t5 t2 t6 t3 t4 t4 t1\n\nI'll start by trying to find the first production that produces t3. Looking at the grammar symbols, the terminals are t0 to t6, and non-terminals are those with NT.\n\nIn the grammar, t3 can be derived by which non-terminals?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9 (but t19 and t9 don't directly produce t3)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 (t2 doesn't directly produce t3)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (recursion)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT52 NT40 (t52 and t40 don't directly)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (no)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT57 NT33 (t57 doesn't)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21 (t17 and t21)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36 (no)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT47 NT11 (no)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT29 NT46 (no)\n- NT39 \u2192 NT13 NT32 (no)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3 (t4 and t3; so NT27 can produce t4 followed by t3)\n- NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51 (no)\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23 (t1 and t23)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23, etc., none seem to go directly to t3\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48 (but t48 goes to t1 and t23)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56 (no)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7 (yes, can go to t1 then something)\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me look at each non-terminal and see their productions to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each non-terminal and see if it can derive a specific terminal.\n\nLooking at NT27: It can go to NT4 NT3. So, to produce t3, maybe NT27 can be a starting point, because it can derive NT4 followed by NT3, and if NT4 can produce t3, then we can get t3 t something else.\n\nLooking at NT4: productions are NT5 and NT36. NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24. NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43, which then might go to t7 or t43... but let me see NT5: NT43 NT24. NT7 can go to NT2 NT19, which can lead to t2 or t19. Not directly to t3.\n\nWait, maybe NT27 can produce t3 directly? No, because NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3, so that's two non-terminals, so it's like t3 would be the last symbol of NT4's derivation, which may take multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is t3 followed by t2, which could be derived from S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 produces NT17 and NT7. Now, each of these needs to derive a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t3 t2... So the first symbol is t3. Let me see which non-terminal can derive t3.\n\nLooking at all productions, I find that NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, but that doesn't produce t3. Wait, let's look again:\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 t3.\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3. So if NT27 can produce t4 followed by t3, then perhaps nt27 can produce t4 and t3, but that requires that NT4 can produce t4?\n\nWait, no. Wait, T3 is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So in NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3, so when you derive, you have [derivations of NT4] followed by t3.\n\nSo, for it to produce t3, perhaps NT4 must produce t4. Let's check NT4's productions: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. Neither NT5 nor NT36 directly give t4. Wait, but wait:\n\nLooking further, NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24. Then NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43. So NT43 can derive a series of NTs, perhaps leading to t3 via another path. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let's take a step back. The entire string starts with t3 t2. So the first two symbols are t3, t2. Let's see if that can come from S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nThen, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo the first part would be [derivations of NT17] [derivations of NT7].\n\nSo, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. So NT17 could be NT1 followed by NT15. But that doesn't get me t2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT17 can derive t1, and NT7 can derive t2.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then, NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to construct the derivation step by step.\n\nLet's try the first few tokens.\n\nString: t3, t2, t4, t0, t0, t5, t4, t3, t4, t5, t1, t3, t4, t5, t0, t0, t3, t1, t2, t2, t4, t2, t4, t0, t5, t2, t6, t3, t4, t4, t1.\n\nSince the string starts with t3, which seems to come from NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3. So, to get t3 as the first symbol, the non-terminal must be NT27, which produces NT4 followed by t3. So, the first two symbols would be [derivations of NT4] t3.\n\nWait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-520","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t4 t3 t4 t6 t0 t1 t6 t5 t4 t3 t4 t0 t6 t4 t0 t1 t5 t0 t4 t2 t4 t6 t0 t2 t0 t2 t6 t6 t4 t2 t3`. It's a pretty long string, and the grammar seems quite involved, so I need to break this down methodically.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) consists of productions where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. The provided grammar follows this structure, with each rule having either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right side.\n\nGiven that, my approach should be to find a sequence of productions that can derive the target string starting from the start symbol, which in this case is 'S'. The target string ends with 't3', which corresponds to a production rule that has 't3' as a result. Looking at the grammar, I see that 'NT3' (or '3' in short) has a production to 't3', specifically 'NT3 \u2192 t3'.\n\nMy plan is to work backwards from the target string, trying to find a way to split it into substrings that match the grammar's productions. Each step, I'll look for a production that can generate a part of the string, starting from the terminal symbols and moving up to the initial non-terminals.\n\nLet's start by listing the string: `t4 t3 t4 t6 t0 t1 t6 t5 t4 t3 t4 t0 t6 t4 t0 t1 t5 t0 t4 t2 t4 t6 t0 t2 t0 t2 t6 t6 t4 t2 t3`. I'll count the tokens to make sure I have 30 parts, which I do.\n\nI'll begin by looking for the longest possible match at the beginning of the string. The first symbol is 't4'. Looking at the grammar, I see if any production ends with 't4'. Scanning the rules, I find 'NT54 \u2192 t3', but that doesn't help. Wait, 'NT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10'. Hmm, not helpful. Maybe another approach: looking for which non-terminals can produce a single terminal. For example, 'NT4 \u2192 t2', 'NT14 \u2192 t5', 'NT52 \u2192 t2', 'NT28 \u2192 t17' which translates to 't5', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by repeatedly splitting the string into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions. Let's try to find which part can be generated by which production.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I'll look for possible productions that can split it. Let's see. The first symbol is 't4'. Looking for a production that ends with 't4'. Scanning through the grammar, I find 'NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46' and 'NT46 \u2192 NT13 NT47'. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 'NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26', but that's not ending with 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can directly generate 't4'. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- 'NT52 \u2192 t2'\n- 'NT47 \u2192 t3'\n- 'NT17 \u2192 t5' (but in the grammar, it's 'NT17 \u2192 t5', but wait, looking again: 'NT17 \u2192 t5' is in the grammar. Yes, 'NT17 \u2192 t5' exists because in the grammar, 'NT17 \u2192 t5' is present.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, the rule is 'NT17 \u2192 t5', but in the given string, the first symbol is 't4', not 't5'. So that's not helpful here. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, looking back, in the provided grammar, there are several instances where non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- 'NT4 \u2192 t2'\n- 'NT14 \u2192 t5'\n- 'NT52 \u2192 t2'\n- 'NT29 \u2192 t5'\n- 'NT58 \u2192 t6'\n- 'NT28 \u2192 t17 \u2192 t5' (wait, no: 'NT28 \u2192 NT17 \u2192 t5' is that correct? Wait, in the grammar, 'NT28 \u2192 NT17', and 'NT17 \u2192 t5'.\n\nWait, no, 'NT17 \u2192 t5' is a production. So 'NT28' can produce 't5' via two steps: NT28 \u2192 NT17 \u2192 t5.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't4', so maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce 't4' directly. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- 'NT52 \u2192 t2'\n- 'NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46'\n- 'NT46 \u2192 NT13 NT47'\n- 'NT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7' and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps 'NT22' or other non-terminals, but in the given grammar, I don't immediately see a production that ends with 't4' as a terminal. Let me list all the productions that have terminals:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 t5 and then t4 via NT7 \u2192 t4? Wait, actually, 'NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19', and neither of those seem to produce 't4'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look through the productions again.\n\nLooking for any NT rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal, but in this grammar, are any of the rules directly producing a terminal?\n\nNo, for example, 'NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7', which are both non-terminals. Similarly, 'NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19', and so on. So perhaps all the terminals are ultimately reached via non-terminals that produce them through a chain. So maybe I need to trace back.\n\nGiven that, I need to find a way to split the string into parts that can each be generated by some production, starting from the start symbol.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find a way from 't4' upwards. So, 't4' must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't4'. Since none of the productions directly produce 't4' as a terminal, 't4' must result from a non-terminal that can split into further productions, ultimately leading to 't4'. This might involve multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to use a top-down approach, starting from 'S' and trying to match the string. Let's see.\n\nThe start symbol is 'S', which has the production 'S \u2192 NT28 NT17'. So 'S' can split into NT28 and NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 can produce 't5' (since NT28 \u2192 NT17, and NT17 \u2192 t5). So the first part is 't5'. But the string starts with 't4', not 't5', so this doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe NT28 can produce other things. Wait, NT28 \u2192 NT17, which \u2192 t5. So 'S' can only start with 't5', but our string starts with 't4', so this can't be correct. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 'S' can split into NT28 and NT17, and then NT28 can be expanded into something else. Wait, but NT28 only has one production: 'NT28 \u2192 NT17'. So from 'S', the first symbol must be 't5' (from NT28 \u2192 t5 via NT17), but our string starts with 't4', so that's a mismatch. Therefore, perhaps 'S' can't directly start with 't4'.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, since our string starts with 't4', so perhaps my initial approach is flawed. Maybe I need to consider that some non-terminals may have multiple productions or that the start symbol can have other productions. Wait, let's check the start symbol.\n\nIn the grammar, 'S' only has one production: 'S \u2192 NT28 NT17'. So 'S' must expand into 't5' followed by something. But our string starts with 't4', which is not 't5', so this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But that seems too quick. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way for 'S' to generate a string that starts with 't4' through some other productions. Let's re-examine.\n\nFrom 'S \u2192 NT28 NT17'. So the first symbol is 't5' (from NT28 \u2192 NT17 \u2192 t5), as mentioned earlier. So the first symbol must be 't5', but our string starts with 't4'. That suggests that the string is invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the grammar provided. Let's start by understanding the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t0 t6 t4 t0 t1 t1 t3 t0 t2 t1 t2 t5 t1 t2 t0 t4 t2 t1 t0 t2 t6 t3 t4 t3 t6 t1 t5 t4 t2 t5 t2`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar uses non-terminals like S, NT57, NT40, etc., and terminals like t3, t0, etc. The goal is to parse the string using the grammar rules and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT28 NT17, so the first two non-terminals must produce 't3' and 't5' respectively because NT17 is t5 from the rules (NT17 -> 't5'). So the first part of the string should start with 't3 t5'.\n\nLooking at the string: It starts with 't3 t0', which doesn't match 't3 t5'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, NT17 -> 't5', yes. So S starts with NT28 and NT17. The first part should be 't3 t5', but the string starts with 't3 t0'. Hmm, that doesn't match. But maybe the first step is more complex. Perhaps the grammar allows for left or right derivations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a parse tree step by step. Let's try breaking down the string.\n\nLet me check the grammar rules. For example, NT7 has two productions: NT7 -> NT2 NT19 and NT7 -> NT13 NT30. NT2 -> 't5' etc. from the rules. Wait, looking at the terminal rules:\n\nThe grammar has some terminals:\n\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't3' (from NT7 -> 't3')\n- NT28 -> 't3' (from NT28 -> 't3')\n- NT30 -> 't4' (from NT30 -> 't3')\n- NT5 -> 't2' (from NT5 -> 't2')\n- NT27 -> 't6' (from NT27 -> 't6')\n- NT4 -> 't2' (from NT4 -> 't2')\n- NT11 -> 't2' (from NT11 -> 't2')\n- NT13 -> 't0' (from NT13 -> 't0')\n- NT0 -> 't5' (from NT0 -> 't5')\n- NT52 -> 't2' (from NT52 -> 't2')\n- NT3 -> 't3' (from NT3 -> 't3')\n\nWait, some of these might not be accurate. Let me cross-verify.\n\nLooking back to the rules, for NT3: it goes to 't3' (NT3 -> 't3'). Similarly, NT4 -> 't2' etc.\n\nThe string starts with t3 t0 t6... So the first part is t3 followed by t0. Let's see how that can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first step is S -> NT28 NT17. So the left side is NT28, which must generate t3. From the rules, NT28 -> 't3' (yes, that's one of the rules: NT28 -> 't3'). So the first symbol 't3' is okay.\n\nNow, the next is 't0'. So the right side is NT17, which must generate t5. But the string's second token is t0, not t5. So that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the NT17 isn't the starting point. Maybe the first production isn't S-> NT28 NT17. Wait, no, according to the grammar, it's S-> NT28 NT17.\n\nSo if that's the case, the first two symbols should be 't3' followed by 't5', but the string starts with 't3 t0'. That suggests that the initial step might not be correct, but that doesn't make sense because S must be the start symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the right-hand side. The first symbol in the string is 't3', and the second is 't0'. If S produces NT28 (t3) and NT17 (t5), then the first two tokens should be 't3 t5', but the string is 't3 t0', so that's a mismatch.\n\nBut maybe NT17 has multiple productions. Looking back, NT17 only has one production: NT17 -> 't5'. So that's the only way to get 't5' from NT17. Therefore, the first two tokens must be 't3' and 't5'. But the string starts with 't3 t0', which can't be generated by S->NT28 NT17. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is to be parsed differently, but according to the rules, S must start with NT28 and NT17, producing 't3' and 't5' respectively. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but the string has more tokens, so perhaps it's using other non-terminals that can derive different terminals. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is correct, but perhaps the next symbols are generated by other productions. Alternatively, perhaps the NT17 can be further broken down, but from the rules, NT17 only goes to 't5'. So no, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking up the non-terminals. Let me check the production for NT17. In the rules, I see NT17 -> 't5', correct. So that's a terminal symbol, not a non-terminal. That means NT17 can only produce 't5', so the right-hand side of S must generate 't5', but the string starts with 't0', which is inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar allows variables to be split differently. Or perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S can split into a different tree, but according to the grammar, S->NT28 NT17 is fixed. Therefore, the first symbols must be 't3' and 't5'.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar consists of non-terminals and terminals, where the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the production rules, each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right, except for some non-terminals that produce a terminal. Wait, no, actually, I notice that some rules produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like `NT7 -> NT2 NT3` or `NT4 -> NT5 NT36`. So each rule is a binary production, which aligns with Chomsky Normal Form where each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to two terminals.\n\nGiven the string to check, it's a sequence of terminals like t1, t5, etc. The string starts with `t1` and ends with `t5`. Let's see.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree from the string, ensuring it can be reduced by the grammar. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of t's and see if they follow some pattern.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each non-terminal to the possible terminals it can produce. Let's list out the non-terminals and see if they can lead to the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces `NT28 NT17`. So each S is a combination of NT28 and NT17. Let's see what NT28 can produce.\n\nNT28: `-> NT17 NT7`. So each NT28 is NT17 and NT7. Let's look at NT17.\n\nNT17: `-> NT1 NT58`. Wait, no, the grammar has NT17: `-> NT1 NT58` and NT58: `-> NT27 NT11`. Wait, no, actually looking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar rules:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT17: `-> NT1 NT58`\nWait no, more carefully:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe rules are:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT54 -> NT35 NT33\n\nNT48 -> NT1 NT23\n\nNT10 -> NT23 NT21\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a tree or figure out the structure.\n\nBut maybe I can look at this as a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and leaves are terminals. The string is supposed to be a concatenation of these terminals, so the parse tree should exactly match the string when read from root to leaves.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string is 35 tokens long, perhaps the parse tree's depth would correspond to this. But perhaps it's easier to count the number of t's and see if it follows any pattern.\n\nWait, another approach: Since all productions are binary, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^k, where k is the depth of the parse tree, assuming no reduction beyond leaves. But the string is 35 symbols, which is not a power of two. Let me compute 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 35 is between them, so this suggests some non-terminals must produce terminals, but perhaps in a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, each production step expands a symbol into two, so for the entire string, if all non-terminals at the top produce non-terminals, the length doubles each time. But when a non-terminal produces a terminal, the length doesn't increase.\n\nWait, the initial symbol S is replaced by NT28 and NT17. Each of these can produce non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t1, followed by t5, etc. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t1, t5, etc.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal tX.\n\nFor example, NT36 -> 't5' (so NT36 can produce 't5'). Similarly,\n\nOther terminals include:\n\nNT4 -> 't2'\n\nNT11 -> 't2'\n\nNT21 -> 't0'\n\nNT27 -> 't1'\n\nNT33 -> 't3'\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT3 -> 't3'\n\nNT5 -> 't3'\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nNT7 -> 't3'\n\nWait, actually, in the initial part of the rules, I see lines like:\n\nNT4 -> 't2'\n\nNT11 -> 't2'\n\nNT21 -> 't0'\n\nNT27 -> 't1'\n\nNT33 -> 't3'\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\n\nNT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT3 -> 't3'\n\nNT7 -> 't3'\n\nAdditionally, NT13: multiple options, but some produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me create a list of terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\nt1: NT7\n\nt2: NT4, NT11\n\nt3: NT3, NT6, NT27, NT33, NT3, NT11 (Wait, need to clarify)\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT... -> tX:\n\nNT6 -> 't4'\n\nNT7 -> 't3' (from two rules, but both same)\n\nNT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT11 -> 't2' and 't0'\n\nNT13 has several rules but none are tX directly.\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nNT21 -> 't0'\n\nNT27 -> 't1'\n\nNT33 -> 't3'\n\nNT36 -> 't5'\n\nSo the string has t1 (NT7), t5 (NT17 or NT36), etc.\n\nWait, but each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule where a non-terminal directly maps to it.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some non-terminals can produce terminalets. For example:\n\nNT36 -> 't5'\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nSo let's list all non-terminals that can produce each terminal:\n\nt0: NT21, NT0 is a terminal t5. Wait, looking:\n\nLooking at the rules, the non-terminals that produce 't0's are:\n\nNT21 -> 't0'\n\nSo the only symbol that can produce 't0' is NT21.\n\nSimilarly, 't1' is produced by NT7 and NT27:\n\nLooking through the rules, I think NT7 can produce 't1'? Wait no, earlier I saw NT7 -> 't3' in some cases.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nLet me check for each NT what they produce.\n\nNT7: \n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30 (duplicate?)\n\nNo, in the initial provided rules, NT7 has two production rules:\n\nLine 1: NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nLine 2: NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nLine 3: NT7 -> NT4 NT48 (from line 58?)\n\nWait, actually lines 58: NT4 -> 't2'\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, the lines are:\n\nLook at the rules, perhaps it's better to list each NT and their possible productions.\n\nLooking at NT7 in the rules:\n\nLooking again:\n\nLines from 1 to:\n\nWait the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nAnd another line:\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nSo NT7 can produce NT2 and NT19, or NT13 and NT30, or NT4 and NT48.\n\nNone of these directly produce a terminal except when a non-terminal on the right side is a terminal.\n\nSo from NT7, the possible terminals it can produce are only if any of the components on the right are directly a terminal. For example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Wait, but NT17 can produce t5.\n\nWait, sorry, perhaps it's better to approach this with the string and see if we can match each token to a possible non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the first token: t1. Which non-terminals can produce 't1'? Looking through the rules, NT7 can produce 't3' but not 't1'. Wait, does any NT directly produce t1?\n\nYes, looking:\n\nNT27 -> 't1'\n\nSo NT27 can produce t1.\n\nSo in the string, the first token is t1, which could come from NT27.\n\nSimilarly"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-537","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to figure out if the string provided is generated by it. Let me break this down step by step because I'm a bit new to this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way a context-free grammar is structured. Each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to consist mostly of production rules where non-terminals produce two other non-terminals, except some that directly produce terminals like 't3', 't5', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t3 t3 t6 t5 t2 t0 t6 t6 t4 t2 t3 t5 t3 t3 t2 t0 t1 t1 t6 t1 t6 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t4 t0 t6 t2 t0 t0 t2`.\n\nSince all the elements in the string are terminals, we need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I'll consider how the grammar can derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the string starts with t3 and t5 because according to the rules, NT28 \u2192 't3' and NT17 \u2192 't5'. That's the first two symbols.\n\nNow, after that, we have t6, t5, etc. Each NT production eventually leads to a terminal symbol. For example, NT28 can produce either NT17 NT7 or 't3'. Since we already used S \u2192 NT28 NT17, we need to consider what comes next from NT17 and NT28.\n\nNT28 also has another production: NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33. Wait, no, looking back, the production for NT48 is given as NT14 NT21, but I think my eye might have missed some production. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, the production NT28 is in the list: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So after NT28 is 't3', the next symbol is 't5' (from NT17). Then NT7 has multiple productions, like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30, etc. So perhaps each step involves resolving these non-terminals into their terminals.\n\nI should probably build a parse tree for the given string, starting from S \u2192 NT28 NT17. The first two symbols, t3 and t5, consume the first two tokens. Then, for each subsequent symbol, I need to see if there's a production that can generate that symbol.\n\nBut since this is a tree with multiple possible branches, it might get complex. Instead of trying to do it manually, I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be decomposed using the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each non-terminal eventually produces a specific terminal symbol through a series of steps. For example, NT57 can produce NT19 NT9 or 't5', etc. But since the string only has certain terminals, I need to see if the grammar can produce exactly that sequence.\n\nLooking at the string, it ends with t2 t0 t0 t2. So I need to see how the non-terminals can produce these terminals. Each step down from the non-terminals should eventually reach a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that each production leads to exactly one terminal in the end. For instance, NT3 \u2192 't3', NT5 \u2192 't5', etc. So each non-terminal directly or indirectly leads to a terminal through a chain of productions.\n\nThe key is that after expanding all non-terminals, the generated string's terminals should match. Since the grammar in CNF allows for binary trees, each non-terminal produces two terminals or other non-terminals. The process continues until all leaves are terminals.\n\nBut without a concrete parse tree, it's a bit challenging. However, looking at the grammar, all paths from non-terminals to terminals seem to terminate, so the grammar is ambiguous but in the standard form for CNF.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long (34 symbols), it's plausible if the grammar can generate it through a sequence of productions.

{"custom_id":"request-545","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is quite long, consisting of a bunch of tokens like t2, t0, t1, etc. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific structures, so I should use that to my advantage.\n\nFirst, I'll try to parse the grammar a bit. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the start symbol S, it's producing two non-terminals: NT28 and NT17. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNext, I'll go through the productions to see how non-terminals expand into terminals or other non-terminals. It looks like the terminals are the ones ending with 't', like t2, t0, t3, etc. So, any time I see a production that ends with a single terminal, that\u2019s a leaf node in the parse tree.\n\nI think the approach here is to attempt to parse the string by working backwards from S and see if it can generate the given string step by step. Starting with S, which requires NT28 and NT17. Let's look at their productions.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, and NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7, and so on. Wait, but NT28 is used once, so perhaps it's better to look for the leftmost symbol first.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to try to find which non-terminals can produce each part of the string. Alternatively, I can think of each production as a function that takes one non-terminal and replaces it with two non-terminals (unless it produces a terminal directly). The string given is a sequence of terminals, so each must come from a production that eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nLet me note down all the non-terminals to see their possible terminals:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (so NT17 and NT7 must produce certain terminals)\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 (which goes to t5 and NT58)\n- NT7 has multiple productions, all leading to combinations of NTs that eventually produce terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, and NT23 is either t3 or reduces to other NTs.\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach it by trying to substitute step by step, starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree. The string is 35 tokens long, and each production step replaces one non-terminal with two. So starting from S which is two non-terminals, each step increases the count by one. So to get to 35 tokens, we'd need 34 steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work backwards from the string and see if it can be built up using the productions.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step doubles the number of symbols except when it produces a terminal, which doesn't double.\n\nBut in any case, let's try to see if the string can be formed step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t2. So let's trace back where t2 can come from.\n\nLooking at the productions, t2 is part of some non-terminals: NT4 \u2192 t2, and NT47 \u2192 t3, t47 also is used in other places, but t2 comes from NT4.\n\nSo, if we have NT4, then it produces t2 and something else. Wait, looking back, NT47 is a non-terminal that produces t3 and t47, but NT4 is a non-terminal that directly produces t2.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are tokens like t2, t0, etc. The non-terminals expand into these. So when a non-terminal is directly a terminal, that's a leaf. Otherwise, it splits into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some non-terminals do produce terminals directly. For example, NT4 \u2192 t2. So NT4 directly produces t2.\n\nSo, if somewhere in the parse tree, we have NT4, it will produce t2 as one of its tokens.\n\nSo, the first token is t2. Maybe the leftmost symbol in the string is t2, so perhaps it's produced by NT4. Then, the production for NT4 is t2, so the other non-terminal has to be matched accordingly.\n\nLooking back, NT4 is produced by NT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20, and NT39 \u2192 NT39 NT10, but wait, I'm confusing the non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the production rules, NT4 is directly a terminal (righthand side is t2). So the production is NT4 \u2192 t2.\n\nSo, for S to produce the string, eventually, it must produce sequences that include t2, t0, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each production for each non-terminal that ends with a terminal, to see what each can produce.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5 (from NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, then NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, etc. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10, but that's non-terminal. Hmm. Wait, no, looking again, the productions:\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their possible terminals:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t2\nNT54 \u2192 t3 (look for NT54 productions: NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33; NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6; NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6; NT55 \u2192 ... Hmm, actually, some NTs produce t3 directly: NT3 \u2192 t3 (from NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 and elsewhere). Similarly, NT53 \u2192 t21 NT2 (I think no, but need to check).\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for direct terminals:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT21 \u2192 t0 (wait, no, NT21 is a non-terminal that may produce t0? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking at NT21: it has a production NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2, but does it directly produce a terminal? Looking through all NT productions, only NT4 directly produces t2, and NT54 \u2192 t3.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I missed some.\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT54: NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33 and NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9. Wait, NT14 is also a non-terminal with NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5. So, maybe NT14 produces t5, but it's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals in the string are produced by certain non-terminals that directly produce them or through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree for the string, starting from the overall structure.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t2, which comes from NT4. So the leftmost part of the string is t2, which is from NT4.\n\nBut how is NT4 formed? Looking at the grammar, NT4 is a terminal, directly from NT4 \u2192 t2. So, to get t2, the parse tree must have NT4 as a node that directly produces t2.\n\nSo, the first part of the parse tree is NT4 \u2192 t2.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the parse tree will expand nodes into their right-hand sides. So, the S production is two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, to get the string starting with t2, perhaps the NT28 or NT17 must produce the t2, but looking at the productions, NT28 produces NT17 and NT7, which then further expand. Maybe that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be analyzed by matching the start non-terminal S and seeing if it can derive the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to recognize that in CNF, the language consists of strings of terminals where the number of symbols is 2^n for some n, with n being the number of non-terminals in the derivation. But the given string has 35 symbols, which isn't a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 35 is between them, so perhaps it's not possible.\n\nWait, but the starting symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is two symbols, so each application of productions increases the count by one (since each production replaces one non-terminal with two, but some are terminals). However, for the initial steps, S (1 symbol) becomes two, then depending on those, it becomes two each, and so on. However, if any of those two are terminals, they don't split anymore.\n\nSo, to get the initial string, let's think about how the starting point can expand to 35 symbols.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe the number of symbols isn't the key, but rather looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-548","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, first, I should probably recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. From what I remember, CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should help because all the production rules here seem to be in that form.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the start symbol is S, and the production rules are all binary except the single terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and other NT symbols break down into other NT symbols or terminals. So it aligns with CNF.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers. The string is: `t2 t0 t5 t0 t1 t4 t3 t0 t6 t1 t1 t0 t6 t3 t5 t4 t5 t0 t6 t6 t6 t3 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t3 t4 t4 t5 t4 t0 t5`. I notice that there are 38 elements, and each corresponds to a symbol in the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here is to probably parse the string step by step using the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But since the string is quite long, I might need to think about how the grammar structures the possible strings.\n\nFirst, let's see how the string starts. It begins with 't2', which is a terminal. In the grammar, looking at the productions, which non-terminals directly produce a 't' terminal? For instance, NT5\u2192... I see NT54 \u2192 't3', NT36\u2192't5', NT29\u2192't5', NT30\u2192't4', NT20\u2192't4', NT2\u2192't5', NT17\u2192't5', etc. So 't's come from specific non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the initial string, starting with 't2', so I need to find a rule that produces 't2'. Scanning the productions: I see NT46 \u2192 't1', NT41 \u2192 't2' if I'm not mistaken because in the rules, NT41 \u2192 't2'? Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT41 is defined elsewhere but wait, in the given rules, I don't see NT41 having a terminal, but looking back:\n\nWait, let me check: in the productions, I see NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23, NT44 \u2192 \"something\", but further down, NT41 \u2192 'something', no terminals. Wait, no, maybe I'm missing a terminal. Looking again at the rules, in the initial part, all the starts have NTs, except towards the bottom, some have terminals. Wait, looking:\n\nAt the very end, I see rules like:\n\nNT39 -> NT39 NT30 (so doesn't produce terminals), NT24 -> \"something\" (no terminal), but some like NT46 \u2192 't1', NT54 \u2192 't3', NT51\u2192 'something' (no terminal?), NT47 \u2192 't3', NT36\u2192't5', NT29\u2192't5', NT30\u2192't4', and others.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I have several production rules where non-terminals are converted into terminals. For example, NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44, but no terminal. Wait, let me actually search carefully.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see that several non-terminals do produce terminals:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT20\u2192 't4'\n\n- NT2\u2192 't5'\n\n- NT27\u2192 't6'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT52\u2192't2'\n\n- NT32\u2192't1'\n\n- NT15\u2192't0'\n\n- NT21\u2192't0'\n\n- NT38\u2192't4'\n\n- NT17\u2192't5'\n\n- NT27\u2192't1'\n\n- NT33\u2192't3'\n\n- NT33\u2192't6'\n\n- NT4\u2192't2'\n\n- NT11\u2192't2'\n\n- NT0\u2192't5'\n\nSo all these non-terminals produce specific terminals. Therefore, to parse the string, I need to start from the top symbol S and see if I can derive this string step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, but wait, no, NT17 is another symbol. Alternatively, let's break down the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a parsing approach, constructing parse trees. Alternatively, build an empty string and see if I can generate the given input by expanding the non-terminals. But this is time-consuming, but maybe manageable given the rules.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by following the production rules through the non-terminals, breaking down each symbol according to allowed productions.\n\nLet's start from the beginning:\n\nThe string starts with 't2', so the first non-terminal must produce 't2'. Looking through the productions, NT46 \u2192 't1' and NT41 \u2192 't2'? Wait, wait, let's check all the rules again:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2': yes, NT4 \u2192 't2'? Let me check the production rules:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. Wait, no, that's a production from NT4. Then, looking for rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't2':\n\nLooking for NT... \u2192 't2'. Hmm, the rules I have don't mention any non-term producing 't2' directly. Wait, perhaps I missed one.\n\nWait, the rules include NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41. NT41 \u2192 't2'?\n\nWait, let me check: looking at the terminal assignments at the end:\n\nNT44 -> 't14' for example? Wait, no, the very end of the rules shows:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n\n...\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\n...\n\nI think I need to go back to the initial part and look for any NT that directly produces a terminal starting with 't2'. Wait, looking:\n\nNT41 \u2192 't2'? Yes, according to the last part, NT41\u2192 something, but at the bottom, I have NT41->... but looking at the end of the provided rules:\n\nWait, actually, at the very end, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT52\u2192't2'\n\nNT32\u2192't1'\n\nNT15\u2192't0'\n\nNT21\u2192't0'\n\nNT38\u2192't4'\n\nNT17\u2192't5'\n\nNT27\u2192't1'\n\nNT33\u2192't3'\n\nNT33\u2192't6'\n\nNT4\u2192't2'\n\nAh, yes! NT4 \u2192 't2'. So NT4 can produce 't2'. Okay, that's one way to get a 't2'.\n\nSo starting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5', as per the rules (NT17 \u2192 't5').\n\nSo S's first symbol is 't5' if we expand it that way. But our string starts with 't2', so that's not matching directly. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the production.\n\nWait, wait, S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nExpanding further, NT17 \u2192 't5'?\n\nBut the string starts with 't2', so this might not help. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for production rules in a way that each symbol can be expanded into multiple steps. Let me try to parse the string from right to left using a top-down approach.\n\nBut perhaps another method is to use a table-driven parser, such as the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But since I'm doing this manually, let me see how the CYK algorithm would approach it.\n\nThe CYK algorithm processes the string from left to right, maintaining a table where each cell (i,j) represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j.\n\nGiven the string, which is 38 symbols long, this would require a lot of computations, but maybe the string has a structure that can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if I can find"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the task and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, perhaps even allowing for a recursive descent parser. But since this is a decision problem, I don't need to implement a parser; instead, I just need to figure out if the string can be derived from the start symbol, S, step by step.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t2 t1 t5 t6 t5 t2 t5 t1 t0 t4 t4 t4 t0 t6 t5 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t4 t6 t2 t6 t6 t2 t1 t6 t0 t6 t5 t3 t0 t6`.\n\nEach rule in the grammar has either two non-terminals or, sometimes, terminals on the right side. Since CNF allows rules to have terminals, it must have been rewritten to handle that. In CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, do I see any productions that have terminals on the right-hand side? Let me check a few. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17: both are non-terminals. NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19: non-terminals. But then there's a production like NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, which are both non-terminals. However, looking through all the symbols, I notice that some of the \"rules\" end with a terminal. For instance, looking at NT56: NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT2. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no. The last line of the provided grammar says: NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT2? Or maybe some other combination. Let me scan again. Oh, I see some productions ending with terminal? Wait, hold on. The user may have presented a misformatted grammar. Because in CNF, rules must have two non-terminals, so any rule with a terminal is part of the transformed grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the user's input. Let me re-read.\n\nThe user provided a long list of rules. For example, looking at the first few:\nS -> NT28 NT17\nNT57 -> NT13 NT47\nNT30 -> NT44 NT13\nNT40 -> NT28 NT21\nNT48 -> NT20 NT26\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT44 -> NT21 NT14\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nand so on.\n\nBut then, for example, NT27 appears in a production as NT27 -> NT17 NT27. Hmm, that's a recursive rule, which is allowed but may complicate things. Also, later on, some rules like NT47 -> NT57 NT33, etc.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm confusing this with another form. Let me think: Chomsky Normal Form requires all productions to have two non-terminals, except for the base case, which can have a single terminal. But the given grammar seems to have all productions with two non-terminals, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nHowever, I notice that most of the productions have non-terminals on both sides, and some are like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, which is fine. But perhaps some have more complex right-hand sides, but in CNF, each production should have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals because it's context-free. So the grammar provided must have transformed the original into CNF, which is correct.\n\nBut looking at the given rules, all the productions seem correct. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT3 NT5, etc. But then, the problem states that some symbols end with 't', like t2, t1, etc. Wait, that suggests that these are actual terminals. So perhaps the grammar was transformed to include terminals in the rules.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because in CNF, each production must be of the form NT \u2192 NT NT. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nWait, I see that some end with 't'? Like NT56 \u2192 NT29 NT46, which is entirely non-terminals. Wait, but perhaps in the full grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, looking at:\n\nNT4 -> NT5 NT36\nNT56 -> NT3 NT2\nNT47 -> NT57 NT33\nNT48 -> NT1 NT23\nNT14 -> NT41 NT44\nNT24 -> NT41 NT20\nNT3 -> NT55\nNT17 -> 't3'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT29 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't4' etc.\n\nAh! There are rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal. So, for example, NT17 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT54 \u2192 't3', and so on.\n\nSo this means that in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. That makes sense because in the Chomsky Normal Form, it's possible to have terminals on the right-hand side, but each production must have exactly two non-terminals except for the base case which is a single terminal.\n\nBut now, looking at the given grammar, many of the non-terminals have productions with two non-terminals, but some have productions that are terminals. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nOkay, so the string to evaluate is a series of terminals: t2, t1, t5, etc. Since the start symbol is S, and each production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be a sequence of terminals generated by following the derivation rules.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a way to parse the string from the start symbol S by applying the productions step-by-step, breaking down the string into non-terminals, eventually replacing them with terminals to form the string.\n\nThis process is similar to top-down parsing, perhaps using a recursive descent approach. I can attempt to simulate this process.\n\nFirst, let me note that S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the derivation starts with S, which splits into two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. Each of these will need to produce a terminal string.\n\nSo first, let's consider NT28 and NT17.\n\nThe string is: t2 t1 t5 t6 t5 t2 t5 t1 t0 t4 t4 t4 t0 t6 t5 t2 t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t4 t6 t2 t6 t6 t2 t1 t6 t0 t6 t5 t3 t0 t6.\n\nLet me denote this string as a list: [t2, t1, t5, t6, t5, t2, t5, t1, t0, t4, t4, t4, t0, t6, t5, t2, t0, t0, t4, t3, t5, t4, t6, t2, t6, t6, t2, t1, t6, t0, t6, t5, t3, t0, t6]\n\nSo the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Therefore, the string is generated by NT28 followed by NT17.\n\nSo, I need to check if NT28 can generate the first half of the string, and NT17 can generate the second half.\n\nLet me tackle NT28 first.\n\nLooking up NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 = NT17 NT7.\n\nSo from the start of NT28's production, the string starts with NT17, followed by NT7.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t2, so NT17 must produce t2.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 has rules, some of which are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. So if we use NT17 \u2192 't3', that would give a string starting with t3, which is not t2. Alternatively, NT17 also has other productions that produce non-terminals, like NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, etc.\n\nBut to produce t2, which is the first symbol, we can't use the terminal production NT17 \u2192 't3'. So instead, we must use a non-terminal production for NT17 that eventually leads to generating t2.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, the only terminal production for NT17 is NT17 \u2192 't3'. So that's a problem because t2 is the first terminal in the string."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar provided starts with S, and each production is written as S -> NT1 NT2, where NT1 and NT2 are non-terminals. The terminals are represented by 'something' where 'something' is a number or a letter followed by a 't' and another number, which stands for a terminal symbol. So, for example, 't6' is a terminal symbol, whereas 'NT54' is a non-terminal.\n\nThe string given consists of a series of terminal symbols: t6, t5, t5, etc. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done by tracking the non-terminals and their expansions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, we can apply the standard algorithm for such parsing, perhaps using a recursive descent method or another suitable technique.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t6. So, I need to see which production rules produce t6. Looking through the grammar, I notice that NT32 and NT57 have t6 in their productions. For example, NT32 -> NT52 NT40, and looking further, NT40 has NT17 and another NT, but I might be getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let me take it step by step. Maybe starting from the top-down approach using the start symbol S, which is NT57 -> NT12 NT28. So, the first step is to expand S into NT57 and NT28. Now, let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT57 has two productions: one is NT57 -> NT19 NT9, and the other is NT57 -> NT9 NT5, based on looking at the grammar rules. Wait, looking back: in the grammar, NT57 has two rules: NT57 -> NT19 NT9 and NT57 -> NT9 NT5. So, S becomes NT57 NT28, and each of these can expand further.\n\nBut the string starts with t6, so I need to see if any of these non-terminals can directly produce t6. Looking at NT57's productions, I see NT57 -> NT19 NT9 and NT57 -> NT9 NT5. Neither of these directly produce t6. So perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at other non-terminals that can produce t6. Checking the grammar, NT21 -> NT35 NT2, which isn't helpful. NT31 isn't a non-terminal in the grammar, so maybe I should look deeper.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see that NT52 -> NT53 NT40, and let's look at those further: NT53 -> NT13 NT44 and NT40 -> NT28 NT21, which in turn expand to NT17 NT7, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the initial step isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that t6 is a terminal symbol, so it has to come directly from a production rule of a non-terminal that only has the terminal and maybe another non-terminal that goes directly to a terminal. But in the grammar, looking for any non-terminal that can derive directly to t6, but I don't see any such rule. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the first expansion is different. Let me check the production rules again. Looking at NT32: NT32 -> NT52 NT40, and NT52 -> NT20 NT36, and NT36 -> 't5', which is a terminal. But how does that help with t6? Alternatively, NT24 -> NT53 NT43, which might eventually produce a t something. I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that some non-terminals can derive a sequence ending in a t6. Let's take NT32: NT32 -> NT52 NT40. Now, NT52 is a non-terminal, and looking at its production: NT52 -> NT20 NT36, and NT36 -> 't5'. So NT52 can produce a sequence that ends in t5. Similarly, NT40 -> NT28 NT21, and NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and NT7 has various productions, one of which is NT7 -> 't5'. So perhaps that's a way to get t5s and t6s.\n\nWait, looking for something that can produce t6. Let me check NT23: NT23 -> NT7 NT41. NT7 can produce t5 or t3 or t1, but not t6. Hmm. NT53: NT53 -> NT13 NT44 or NT6 NT56. NT13 can produce NT45 NT26, etc. Not seeing t6 yet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a path. Let me think: t6 appears in NT30 -> NT15 NT30, but that's recursion. Or NT40 -> NT47 NT11, where NT47 can produce NT57 NT33, etc. Maybe this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of productions. Let's look at the string and see how the t6s and t5s might fit.\n\nThe string starts with t6. Since no non-terminal directly produces t6, perhaps the initial step is to look for a path that leads to t6 after some other symbols. Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly and need to use a different method, like the CYK algorithm.\n\nWait, CYK is designed for CNF grammars, so let's try that. The CYK algorithm works by creating a table of possible non-terminals for each substring.\n\nFirst, I need to tokenize the string into individual symbols. The string is: t6 t5 t5 t6 t6 t4 t4 t3 t5 t1 t6 t2 t4 t6 t0 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t3 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t3 t2 t6 t4 t5 t5. So each token is separated by a space, making 41 symbols.\n\nThe CYK algorithm involves creating a table with rows representing the positions in the string and columns for each position. For each position, I check which productions can derive the substring and update the non-terminals accordingly.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t6. Since no non-terminal directly produces t6 in the start. Wait, maybe I'm missing that. Let me check the grammar again. Wait, looking at NT15: NT15 -> 't0' 't3'? Or perhaps NT15 -> NT7 NT12? Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT9 -> 't3' 't0', which is two terminals. So NT9 produces \"t3 t0\", but we have a single t3. Wait, that's one of the rules: NT9 -> 't3' is there, and also NT9 -> 't0' 't3' is another.\n\nWait, in the production rules, I see that NT29: NT29 -> NT0 NT36, but NT0 and NT36 can produce t3 or t5. Not directly t6. Looking for where t6 appears as a terminal, perhaps in NT32: NT32 -> NT52 NT40, and NT52 -> NT20 NT36, and NT36 -> 't5'. Hmm, not t6.\n\nWait, maybe t6 is produced by some combination of expansions. For example, NT25 isn't present, but perhaps looking elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol t6 is not in the initial expansion but deeper in the parse tree.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for possible sequences that can lead to t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT25: NT25 -> NT9 NT17, and NT9 can produce 't3' or 't0' 't3'. NT17 is 't5' according to one of the productions: NT17 -> 't5'. So if NT9 is 't3' and NT17 is 't5', that would generate 't3 t5' for NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at NT32: NT32 -> NT52 NT40.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a string generated by a grammar in CNF has a length that's a power of 2. Let me count the tokens in the string. Hmm, that's 39 tokens. Wait, 2^5 is 32 and 2^6 is 64, so 39 isn't a power of 2. That alone might suggest the string isn't in the language, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions just yet. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount: 1. t5, 2. t5, 3. t3, 4. t1, 5. t1, 6. t0, 7. t3, 8. t4, 9. t0, 10. t4, 11. t4, 12. t3, 13. t2, 14. t3, 15. t6, 16. t0, 17. t6, 18. t2, 19. t5, 20. t5, 21. t4, 22. t5, 23. t2, 24. t0, 25. t3, 26. t3, 27. t2, 28. t6, 29. t3, 30. t2, 31. t6, 32. t1, 33. t4, 34. t4, 35. t0, 36. t1. Wait, that's 36 tokens. Okay, 36 is not a power of 2. So that's a red flag.\n\nIn CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each step effectively doubles the number of symbols. So the length of the string must be 2^n where n is the number of derivation steps. If the string isn't of that form, it's definitely not generated by this grammar.\n\nBut to make sure, I should see if there's any way the string could fit. The starting symbol is S, which seems to break down into NT57 and NT28. Let's look at NT57 and NT28 in the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT57: it can produce NT13 NT47 or NT19 NT5 (since production 28 is NT57 -> NT13 NT47 and 27 is NT57 -> NT19 NT9, but in the string, I saw t9 might be NT9 leading to 't3'? Wait, let me check the terminals.\n\nWait, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't5', NT27 -> 't1', NT30 -> 't4', etc. So each non-terminal eventually refers to a terminal symbol via productions.\n\nWait, but focusing back on the length: 36 isn't a power of 2. The powers of 2 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. 36 is between 32 and 64. So it's not a power of 2.

{"custom_id":"request-567","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of symbols ending with 't3'. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar given seems to fit this form since all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, except for the last one which is a terminal. Wait, no, actually, looking again, the last one in the given grammar is a production like NT15 -> 't0', so that's a terminal symbol on the right side. So the grammar is indeed in CNF, which is good because CNF is useful for certain parsing algorithms, but I'm not sure if that affects my approach here.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t3 t6 t1 t2 t6 t1 t6 t0 t5 t2 t1 t4 t0 t5 t0 t5 t2 t0 t0 t0 t3 t4 t0 t2 t5 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t3 t3 t4 t5 t6 t3.\n\nI notice that the string ends with 't3', which is a terminal symbol. The grammar has several terminal symbols: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. So I don't have to worry about invalid terminals.\n\nNow, the challenge is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT28 NT17. So the initial expansion starts with two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. Each of these can be expanded into other non-terminals or terminals, depending on their production rules.\n\nI need to model how these non-terminals can generate the terminals in the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step will expand a single non-terminal into two others or a terminal. However, because the production rules are mostly two non-terminals, the process will involve a sequence of substitutions expanding these non-terminals until all that's left are terminals matching the target string.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One method is to represent the string as a list of symbols and model the replacements step by step, contracting the non-terminals. Alternatively, since it's a tree structure, the string corresponds to a derivation of the start symbol into the given terminal sequence.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see if there's a systematic way to check if the string can be generated. Let's see the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal can expand into two others, so the string is built up by combining the expansions of these non-terminals. Each terminal in the string must correspond to a production that directly matches that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have multiple possible terminals. For example, NT40 can expand to NT28 NT21 or NT4 NT54. NT28 can go to NT17 NT7 or NT7 NT15. NT7 has multiple productions: NT7 can go to NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, or NT4 NT48.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3. So the first symbols should be generated by the leftmost non-terminal expanding into a terminal. Let me check what non-terminals can directly derive into 't3'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all non-terminals that can produce 't3':\n\n- NT1 -> 't5' (No)\n- NT2 -> 't5' (No)\n- NT3 -> 't3' (Yes)\n- NT6 -> 't4' (No)\n- NT9 -> 't3' (Yes)\n- NT4 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT39 -> NT13 NT32 or NT39 NT10\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nNT3 -> 't3' (Yes)\nNT9 -> 't3' (Yes)\nNT4 -> 't2' (No)\nNT5 -> NT43 NT24 (no terminal)\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, NT4 NT48\nLooking for where NT3 or NT9 produce 't3'.\n\nWait, actually, checking the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT19 NT55 (No terminal)\nWait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't3' except perhaps NT27 and NT17.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' and 't3'?\nWait, in the given grammar, the last entry is:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' (Yes)\nBut earlier, it's also NT17 -> NT1 NT58. So NT17 can produce 't5' directly.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't3'. So maybe the first expansion is from a non-terminal that can produce 't3'. Looking again:\n\nLooking through all rules, NT7 can produce 't3' via NT7 -> 't3'? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under the terminal symbols:\n\nLooking for any NT that directly produces 't3':\n\n- Is there any rule like NTx -> 't3'? I think not. Wait, let me recheck the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the end part of the grammar:\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT21 -> 't0'\nNT27 -> 't6'\nNT33 -> 't3'\nNT38 -> 't4'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't3'\nNT17 -> 't5'\nAnd other rules that are not terminal.\n\nAh, so NT9 can produce 't3' directly.\n\nSo, if S expands into NT28 NT17. So NT28 and NT17. If NT17 can produce 't5', but the first symbol is 't3', so that wouldn't match unless one of the non-terminals in the leftmost expansion produces 't3'.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, the only way to get 't3' as a terminal is through NT3 -> 't3' or NT9 -> 't3'.\n\nWait, the first symbol is 't3', so one of the non-terminals in the initial expansion (NT28 or NT17) must produce 't3' through a series of productions. But looking at NT28:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nSo NT28 immediately leads to NT17 and NT7. Neither of these can produce 't3' directly. So if the initial expansion is NT28 NT17, both of which are non-terminals, they will have to be expanded further.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think about the process of expanding S.\n\nS starts as NT28 NT17. Each of these non-terminals will be expanded step by step until we reach the string.\n\nSo the string is built from the leftmost derivation, so we start replacing the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nSo first step: S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, I need to choose which of NT28 or NT17 to expand first. Let's try expanding the leftmost, NT28.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo now the string (or the current expansion) becomes NT17 NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the expansion replaces NT28 with NT17 NT7, so S becomes NT17 NT17 NT7.\n\nBut then, in the next step, I would expand the leftmost NT17, which can be replaced either by 't5' or by NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the target string is 't3', so perhaps the initial expansion needs to somehow produce 't3' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion is not NT28, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait no, the start is S -> NT28 NT17. So the first two symbols after expansion are the results of NT28 and NT17. So perhaps I need both of them to produce strings that can combine into the target.\n\nBut looking at the target string, it starts with t3. So perhaps either NT28 or NT17 must produce a 't3' in the terminal sequence, but as per the grammar, NT28 can only produce NT17 NT7, and NT17 can produce 't5' or NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, but neither of these can produce 't3' directly. So is there any way to produce 't3' as a terminal in the expansion?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't3' comes from one of the non-terminals in further productions.\n\nLooking deeper, NT7 can be expanded into 't3' through NT7 -> 't3'.\n\nAh, yes, NT7 can produce 't3'. So perhaps the path is S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string to evaluate is: `t6 t3 t5 t3 t5 t5 t4 t3 t4 t6 t6 t1 t1 t1 t3 t4 t6 t1 t1 t4 t1 t5 t4 t3 t4 t0 t4 t6 t0 t4 t5 t1 t5 t4 t6 t1 t6`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, looking at the given grammar, I can confirm that all rules are in this form except maybe some have more than two symbols on the right, but I see that after checking, most are two symbols, with a few like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 or NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, which are two non-terminals. I think that's CNF because in some cases, CNF allows for length-2 and length-3 productions, but typically, it's the version where all productions are length 2 or 1. Wait, no, actually, in binary Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are length 2, so each production has exactly two symbols on the right. So this must be in binary CNF.\n\nThe string consists of symbols that are terminals: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. So these correspond to the terminals in the grammar. The non-terminals are NT1, NT2, NT3, up to NT58. So the idea is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that S starts as S \u2192 NT28 NT17, right? So the initial step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the string must be generated by replacing NT28 and NT17 through a series of productions until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals, matching the input.\n\nBut this approach would involve building a parse tree that's very large, given the string length of 40 terms. That's impractical to do manually.\n\nAn alternative approach is to simulate the CYK algorithm, which is a dynamic programming algorithm used for parsing strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm can determine whether a string can be generated by a given grammar.\n\nWait, but implementing CYK would require setting up a table and checking each substring, which is time-consuming. Since I'm just starting, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt to find a way to derive the string step by step, but the string is 40 symbols, so without a parse tree, it's challenging.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps I can find a way to relate certain terminals to non-terminals.\n\nLet's consider each NT's production rules and see if I can identify how they can lead to the string.\n\nFor example, looking at the start symbols NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So after replacing S, the first part is NT28 and the second part is NT17. Let's see what NT28 becomes: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So overall, the string starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17. So the string will have three parts: NT17, NT7, NT17. Now, we have to replace each NT in order.\n\nLet me try to break down NT17. From the rules, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So replacing NT17 gives us NT1 and NT58. Now, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, so the first NT17 becomes NT1 and NT58, and the second NT17 (from the start) is still pending. Wait, no, the initial replacement is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which is then replaced as NT17 NT7 NT17. So the first NT17 becomes NT17 NT7, but wait, no: S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17. So we have three parts now: NT17 (from first), NT7 (middle), NT17 (third).\n\nSo now, each of these NTs needs to be broken down.\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So replacing each NT17:\n\nFirst NT17: a \u2192 b c, becomes NT1 and NT58. Second part is NT7, which can be replaced multiple ways. The third part is another NT17, which again becomes NT1 and NT58.\n\nBut I need to track how each replacement affects the string. Alternatively, perhaps focusing on the terminals.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6. In the grammar, some NTs produce t symbols:\n\nLooking for NT rules that directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at the given rules, NT36 \u2192 't4', NT3 \u2192 't3', NT6 \u2192 't4' (I think?), or wait:\n\nWait, going through the rules again, the terminals are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't2', 't4', etc., but some produce terminals:\n\nWait, let me check each rule for direct terminals:\n\nFrom the provided grammar, when a rule is like NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, that's a production with two non-terminals, but direct terminals appear immediately, such as:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' (I think?), or wait, NT51 \u2192 NT1 NT15? No, in the given, the terminals are:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\n\nWait, the very last rules have: NT10 \u2192 't1', NT29 \u2192 't3', NT39 \u2192 't3', etc. So I think NT17 \u2192 't5', and NT27 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo when the grammar is at S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which is then NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nEach NT17 can produce 't5', as per the rules. So if NT17 is replaced directly by 't5', then each occurrence of NT17 in the left and right could produce 't5'. But wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nWait, no\u2014looking through the provided grammar, the only NT that produces a terminal is when it's a single symbol on the RHS. But in the rules, for example, NT36 \u2192 't4'\u2014but I don't see ND36. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, actually, the rules are a bit hard to parse because of the way they're written. Wait, more accurately, looking through the rules, I see rules like:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n\nAnd so on. The only rules that produce terminals are when a single NT is expanded to a single terminal. But maybe I'm mistaken because sometimes productions can produce mixed symbols. Wait, no: in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So in the given grammar, any rule that has a terminal symbol on the RHS must have only that terminal and nothing else.\n\nSo, looking for rules where the RHS is a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nIs there any rule that produces a terminal? Let's check.\n\nLooking through each production, for example, NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24: that's two non-terminals. NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47: two non-terminals.\n\nLooking for a production where RHS is just a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I've missed some. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 't5' \u2014 yes! So NT17 directly produces t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't6' \u2014 that's a rule where NT27 is replaced by t6.\n\nAlso, NT10 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't3' \u2014 no, wait: looking at the rules, NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36? Or is there a production where NT29 is replaced by a single terminal? Hmm, looking again:\n\nWait, checking the provided grammar, the terminals are as follows:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't3' \u2014 wait, no, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6: two non-terminals.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33: two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

I need to clarify this. The production rules include terminals as the right-hand side. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, and then NT17 and NT28 are also in the grammar and can be expanded further until we reach terminals. But looking at the given productions, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT17 -> 't3', NT54 -> 't3', etc. So, when parsing, whenever we encounter a terminal, we can match it against the corresponding production rules.\n\nThe string to parse is a sequence of these terminals. So the string is: t0 t4 t5 t4 t1 t4 t1 t0 t3 t5 t4 t0 t1 t4 t2 t6 t0 t0 t5 t4 t6 t0 t0 t5 t5 t2 t6 t0 t2 t3 t2 t6 t1 t3 t3 t6 t5 t4.\n\nLet me try to construct a parse tree step by step. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals on the right, so a parse tree will be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children. The problem is that each non-terminal can produce two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which is NT28 NT17.\n\nWe need to derive the string starting with 't0' 't4' etc.\n\nWait, but S is NT28 followed by NT17. So, the production S -> NT28 NT17 means that the start symbol S corresponds to the sequence t28 followed by t17, but t28 and t17 themselves can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but according to the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't3', NT54 -> 't3', etc. So, in the initial step, S expands into two non-terminals, which we then need to expand until we get all terminals.\n\nBut let's see: the very first symbol in the string is t0. So, let's look at which non-terminals produce t0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 is a non-terminal, but looking through all the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t0. The closest is NT15 -> NT3 NT7, NT21 -> NT35 NT2, etc. Wait, the given productions:\n\nLooking back, the rules for NT0: actually, looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-591","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string is pretty long. Let me take a step back and try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules. Each production is either A -> BC, A -> a, or A -> the empty string. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the productions on the left side (like S, NT57, etc.) only produce two non-terminals or one terminal. So it's definitely in CNF.\n\nThe string to check is \"t1 t5 t4 t3 t3 t1 t1 t0 t2 t1 t3 t4 t4 t2 t3 t2 t1 t6 t2 t6 t2 t5 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t3 t5 t1 t6 t6 t0 t2 t2 t5.\" I need to see if there's a derivation starting from S and ending at this string, expanding all the non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit time-consuming, but let's see. The process would involve building the parse tree or using a method like CYK parsing since it's in CNF. But since I'm just doing this manually, I might need another approach.\n\nWait, I recall something called the \"derivation tree\" method. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can represent it as a binary tree where each internal node is A->BC, and the leaves are terminals. So each production must produce exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, I can start by identifying all the terminals. The string is separated by spaces, so each \"t\" and number is a terminal symbol. Wait, but looking back at the grammar, some terminals are like t0, t1, t2, etc. So the string must match these terminal symbols.\n\nI should map the string to the grammar's terminals. Let me list the terminals present in the string and the grammar. In the grammar, I see terminals like t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. The string uses t1, t5, t4, t3, t2, t0, t6, so all are covered.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, so any derivation must start from S. The first step in the parse tree is S -> NT28 NT17, according to the given grammar. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond to the productions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t1. Wait, according to the grammar, S -> NT28 NT17, so the first two non-terminals are NT28 and NT17.\n\nBut let me check what NT28 and NT17 derive to.\n\nLooking up NT28: It's NT44 NT13. Both NT44 and NT13 must be expanded. Wait, in the string, the first symbol is t1. So perhaps NT17 produces t1? Let me check NT17's production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a production NT17 -> NT1 NT58, and another production NT17 -> NT58 NT1, but wait, maybe I need to look more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production is NT17 -> NT1 NT58, but also other possibilities. Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT17: I see NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and another line says NT17 -> NT58 NT1. Hmm, but wait, both are the same, just swapped. Because it's a CNF, it's an OR of all possible production rules. But in the given grammar, NT17 is shown several times, so let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT17, I see lines like:\n\nNT17 -> NT11 NT17\n\nWait no, looking again, the user provided the grammar with several lines. Let me find where NT17 is defined. Looking through the lines, I see:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT1 NT58\"\n\nand\n\n\"NT17 -> NT58 NT1\" \u2014 but I think these are two separate productions, which in the grammar can only have one. Wait, in CNF, each non-terminal has a set of production rules. So likely, the two lines under NT17 are alternative productions. So NT17 can be NT1 NT58 or NT58 NT1.\n\nWait, but both are the same because the order might not matter in the left-hand side, but for parsing, the context matters. Hmm, maybe I need to check all possibilities.\n\nWait, but I might be making a mistake here because NT17 can only expand to a certain number of options. Let me look again at the grammar. Oh, in the grammar, there's only one production for NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nand\n\nNT17 -> NT58 NT1\n\nWait, that's two separate productions, which would be possible if the grammar allows for different orders.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a single production that includes both? Wait, no. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at line 9: NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nThen line 10: NT17 -> ?\n\nWait, I might have miscalculated earlier. Let me read the entire grammar again, but perhaps this is too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t1, and S -> NT28 NT17, I need to see if NT17 can produce t1 as its terminal. But let's see, the initial S splits into NT28 and NT17. The first derived terminal would come from one of these, and the next from the other.\n\nWait, perhaps S -> NT28 NT17. So the first step is to derive S into NT28 and NT17, each becoming their own trees. So the first symbol in the string comes from either NT28 or NT17.\n\nIf the string starts with t1, and looking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can derive t1.\n\nLooking through all the grammar productions, find all non-terminals that have a production that ends with t1. For example, looking at NT17, if it can derive something that eventually leads to t1.\n\nWait, but maybe another approach: the string is composed of a series of terminals, so each step in the derivation must expand the current nodes to produce the next terminal in the string.\n\nThis might take a while, but perhaps I can outline a possible parse.\n\nLet me try to map the first few symbols.\n\nString: t1, t5, t4, t3, t3, t1, t1, t0, t2, t1, t3, t4, t4, t2, t3, t2, t1, t6, t2, t6, t2, t5, t4, t5, t4, t3, t3, t4, t0, t3, t5, t1, t6, t6, t0, t2, t2, t5.\n\nStarting from S. S -> NT28 NT17. So the first thing is that the string should be built from the expansion of NT28 and NT17.\n\nSuppose NT28 expands to two symbols, and NT17 expands to two, etc., but let me try to see the initial steps.\n\n1. Derive S into NT28 and NT17. The first two symbols in the string are t1 and t5.\n\nBut wait, does that mean that one of the NT28 or NT17 produces t1 and the other produces t5? Or is it that the order is flipped?\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S -> NT28 NT17. So the first non-terminal in the expansion is NT28, and the second is NT17. So when we expand, the first token derived from NT28 is t1, then the next token from NT17 is t5.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the parse starts from S, which splits into NT28 and NT17. The first production starts at the first symbol, and the next starts at the second symbol. But in this case, both NT28 and NT17 are leaves in the parse tree, so their derivations can produce any number of symbols, but in the context of the string, the order matters.\n\nWait, but since we're building the string from left to right, the first symbol in the string comes from the NT28 derivation, and the next from NT17, assuming that NT28 is the leftmost derivation. But wait, in CNF, each production expands to exactly two symbols, so perhaps I need to model it as a tree where each node splits into two children, which can either be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look for the longest possible match. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be more efficient, but as I'm doing this manually, it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the strings, most of them are made up of t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. The grammar translates some non-terminals to these tokens. For instance, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and in the terminal mapping, NT17 -> 't3', so that part becomes t3.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT14 -> 't5', wait no, looking back, NT14 produces NT5 and NT44, and further down, I see NT14 -> NT53 NT5, but NT53 and NT5 are non-terminals. However, looking more carefully, I see NT5 -> NT43 NT24, but wait, I might be missing some terminal mappings. Let me check all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar productions, some non-terminals produce a terminal at the end. For example, NT7 -> NT4 NT48, but wait, NT48 -> NT20 NT26, and so on, but perhaps some non-terminals directly give a terminal. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should create a mapping of each non-terminal to its terminal.\n\nLooking again through the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't3' (because NT17 -> NT17's production leads to 't3' in the right-hand side). Wait, no, looking for where NTx -> 't something'. Hmm, in the grammar, some of the productions may end up as terminals. For example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, but NT17 -> 't3', NT7 is a non-terminal. So that production would result in 't3' followed by whatever NT7 produces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the grammar more clearly. Let's list all the non-terminals and see which ones produce terminal tokens.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't3' (I see NT17 -> NT17's production, wait no, looking at all the rules, I see lines like NT7 -> NT4 NT48, but I need to find where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, not a combination.\n\nWait, maybe some of the lower-level non-terminals do produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT3 -> 't19' no, not directly. Wait, let me check each production to see if any RHS consists entirely of terminals. For example, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT17 NT27: no terminals here.\n\nWait, maybe the 't' tokens are directly produced by certain non-terminals? Oh, I see at the end, there's a list of NT -> t? Let me look:\n\nWait, the very end of the grammar says:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n...\nBut then later:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\nWait, no, looking again, I think I'm wrong. Looking through the grammar, the last few lines:\n\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT55 -> 't29' no, wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals that produce terminals are NT3 (t19?), no, wait the very end says:\n\nLooking from the bottom:\n\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT55 -> 't29' no, wait no. Let me re-express all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar again, the lines towards the end are:\n\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT30 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't4'\n- NT20 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT21 -> 't0', no, NT21 -> NT15 NT2, but in another line, NT21 -> 't6'? No, I think I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminal assignments are listed at the bottom of the grammar:\n\nLooking at the last lines:\n\n- NT48 -> 't1' No, looking carefully:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT54 -> 't3'\nWait, maybe I'm misreading. I think the user provided the grammar in a long list, and towards the end, under some NT productions, there are terminal symbols. For example, at the end of the user's message:\n\nNT40 -> NT47 NT11\n...\nNT29 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't4'\nNT30 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't4'\nNT20 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT27 -> 't6'\nNT3 -> 't3'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT32 -> 't1'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT21 -> 't0'\nNT38 -> 't4'\nNT17 -> 't5'\nNT27 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't3'\nNT33 -> 't6'\nNT4 -> 't2'\nNT11 -> 't2'\nNT0 -> 't5'\n\nWait, so now I see that several non-terminals directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT27 -> 't6', NT30 -> 't4' (among other possibilities), etc.\n\nSo the terminal symbols are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and others like t47, t57, etc., but looking at the grammar, I see those are non-terminals that might produce terminals, but in the given grammar, only some of them directly do.\n\nSo now, the string to check is:\n\nt4 t6 t0 t4 t4 t1 t1 t3 t4 t3 t3 t4 t0 t6 t3 t3 t1 t5 t1 t3 t2 t4 t0 t4 t4 t2 t4 t6 t6 t2 t6 t0 t6 t5 t4 t0 t1 t3 t6.\n\nThat's a long string, but I can see that each symbol is t0 to t6. So my approach is to parse the string according to the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S is NT28 NT28. Wait, no: in the given grammar, S is defined as:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28? Wait, looking back: the first line is S -> NT28 NT28 NT28? Wait, no, the first line is S -> NT28 NT28? Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the user's message, the first line is:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28\nWait, no, wait, no, in the initial user message, it's:\n\nFirst line: S -> NT57 NT17\n\nOh no, I misread. Let me look again.\n\nThe starting production is S -> NT28 NT28? Wait, no:\n\nWait, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28? Wait, no, the initial line is:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar lines again:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT57 NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, the user wrote:\n\n\"Here is the start: ```Context-free grammar: S -> NT57 NT17``\". Wait, no, actually, the initial line is:\n\nContext-free grammar:\n\nS -> NT28 NT28\n\nWait, no, let me read the user's grammar.\n\nHere's the very first line of the user's grammar:\n\nS -> NT57 NT17\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's message:\n\nThey wrote:\n\nGrammar: \nS -> NT57 NT17\nNT57 -> NT13 NT47\n...\n\nSo the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT57 followed by NT17. So the first two symbols in the string should be whatever NT57 and NT17 produce.\n\nLooking at the end of the user's message, under the terminal productions:\n\nNT57 -> 't19'\n\nWait, no, in the terminal productions, the user wrote:\n\nNT29 -> 't5'\nNT30 -> 't4'\nNT30 -> 't3'\nNT20 -> 't4'\nNT20 -> 't3'\nNT2 -> 't5'\nNT27 -> 't6'\nNT3 -> 't3'\nNT6 -> 't4'\nNT9 -> 't3'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT32 -> 't1'\nNT15 -> 't0'\nNT21 -> 't0'\nNT38 -> 't4'\nNT17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is quite long, but I think the process involves breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. But wait, in the provided grammar, some rules have more than two symbols, like NT32 \u2192 NT46 NT1. So, maybe I need to simplify these into intermediate steps or use a parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but that might be complicated for a human.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be represented as a series of expansions starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S expands into NT28 NT17, and each NT has its own production rules. So, the string should be built by processing these step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The string starts with t4 t4... Let me see which NTs can produce t4. Looking at the grammar, for example, NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43, but that doesn't produce a terminal directly. Maybe I need to see a list of NTs that can output a terminal.\n\nI notice that some NTs like NT6 \u2192 't4' and NT9 \u2192 't3' etc. So, let's see:\n\nt4 is produced by NT6, right?

Wait, NT20 expands into NT52 NT26, and those further expand. Let me check:\n\nLooking at each NT's productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 (and 7\u2192\u2026). Wait, NT17 also has NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and others. Hmm, this is getting tangled.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a tree structure. The start is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string begins with something derived from NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me consider the first part of the string: t4 t4 t3 t0 t3 t4 t6 t4 t1...\n\nLooking for t4, which comes from NT6. So, if T is a terminal string, perhaps the initial part starts with NT6.\n\nBut NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, both NT17 and NT7 must contribute to the first few terminals. Let me check the productions for NT17:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Wait, this seems recursive. Alternatively, NT17 also has NT17 \u2192 NT27 NT27? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me see which NTs produce t4. From the list, NT24 produces t2 when NT53 is involved? Wait, no\u2014a terminal t4 might come from NT24's expansion, but I'm not sure. Let's see the direct terminals:\n\nWait, the terminals are when an NT produces a terminal symbol, such as 't3', 't4', etc.\n\nLooking back at all NT rules, the ones that end with a terminal are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2' (Wait, looking back at the grammar... Hmm, I need to double-check all NT rules.)\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46\nNT32 \u2192 NT52 NT1\nBut actually, looking again, the only direct terminals are those that appear towards the end, like:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT36 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n- NT20 can be t4 or t3?\nWait, no\u2014NT20 can expand into NT52 NT26, and then further. So, maybe NT20's expansions don't produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT \u2192 terminal rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT39 \u2192 't6' (Wait, NT15 \u2192 't0' and other NTs, but I'm missing a list here. Let me go through each rule:\n\nLooking at each production, I'm only seeing a few NTs that produce terminals:\n\nWait, looking at all rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2' via NT29? No, looking again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the entire grammar for NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\nNT36 \u2192 't5'\nNT30 \u2192 't3'\nNT33 \u2192 't6'\nNT33 \u2192 't3' (Also)\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\nNT19 \u2192 't4'\nNT43 \u2192 't5'\nNT52 \u2192 't2'\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\nNT11 \u2192 't2'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\nNT20 \u2192 't3' or another path?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. For example, NT39 \u2192 NT56 NT30, which ultimately might produce a terminal, but it's unclear. Maybe the best approach is to consider that each non-terminal either produces another non-terminal or a terminal, and each step in the string corresponds to a production.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nLet's see what NT28 and NT17 can produce:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 or other options.\n\nBut the string begins with t4 t4... So, perhaps NT28 produces NT6, which then becomes t4.\n\nWait, but NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, both NT17 and NT7 need to produce the initial t4, t4... How?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like S producing NT28 NT17, which then might produce terminal tokens.\n\nWait, the non-terminals in the grammar end up producing sequences of terminals. For example, S starts as NT28 NT17. Looking at NT28, it produces NT17 NT7. NT17 produces NT1 NT58, and NT7's productions involve NT2 and NT19, and so on. Eventually, each of these non-terminals seem to produce sequences ending in terminals like 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nBut the string we have consists only of terminal symbols: t2, t4, etc. So the grammar's S must derive the given string through a series of steps where only terminals appear at the top level.\n\nWait, but each production that ends in 'a' must be an atomic production. For the given string to be valid, the entire string must be a sequence of these atomic steps starting from S and expanding until only terminals are left.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a leftmost derivation. Alternatively, I can check if the string can be split according to the grammar's productions. Each step in the derivation will reduce parts of the string based on the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is quite long. Maybe it's better to model this as a tree. Alternatively, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is suitable here, known as the Cocke-Younger-avedala parser, but I'm not sure how to implement that manually.\n\nAn alternative way is to check if the string can be built by recursively splitting it according to the grammar's rules, starting from S. But given the complexity, this might take a lot of steps. However, since the given string is t2 followed by t4, t6, etc., I can consider possible splits.\n\nWait, let's see. The initial S is NT28 NT17. So the derivation starts with NT28 NT17 \u2192 something, but actually, the left-hand side is two non-terminals, so each must expand into their respective sequences.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string by looking for possible splits. For example, the first part is t2. Looking at the grammar, what non-terminals produce t2?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 ends with NT58 \u2192 NT2 NT19. NT7 has productions like NT2 NT19, so maybe that's a path. Alternatively, NT24 -> NT41 NT20, which eventually might produce t2 via NT44 ->... Wait, looking at the non-terminals that produce t2.\n\nLooking at all the productions, I see NT44 -> NT14 NT2 and NT24 -> NT41 NT20, but elsewhere, NT2 appears in NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33, and NT54 \u2192 NT3 NT33, but not directly. Wait, looking through all the rules, I see that NT? sometimes end up producing 't's.\n\nWait, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5', NT23 \u2192 't2', etc. So perhaps the string can be split into these.\n\nSo, let's look at the given string: t2 t4 t6 t5 t1 t4 t4 t2 t3 t0 t1 t1 t0 t2 t1 t6 t0 t0 t4 v40 t0 t0 t1 t5 t4 t5 t6 t5 t6 t1 t2 t5 t1 t4 t3 t6 t3 t2 t3 t1.\n\nWait, the string is a series of 't's with subscripts. Each 't' is a terminal.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the entire string can be split into productions. Starting from S, which is NT28 NT17 \u2192 their respective expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to go backwards. The last symbol is t1. Looking at the productions, which non-terminals produce t1? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t1. So that's a problem. Because in the grammar, the only way to produce t1 is if some non-terminal expands into a combination that includes t1 at the top level.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any non-terminal's production includes t1 in the top level.\n\nLooking at the rules: I see NT47 \u2192 NT57 NT33, NT57 has some rules, but I don't see any production that leads directly to t1. Wait, actually, looking again, maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2, NT2 has a rule to 't5', and NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT3, which leads to t6 (since NT30\u2192t4), etc.\n\nWait, I think I might have made an error earlier. Looking at the grammar, some of the non-terminals might produce t1. For example, looking at NT27: it has a production NT17 NT27, but perhaps one of its productions includes t1 directly.\n\nLooking again, there's a rule for NT21: NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33, but perhaps somewhere else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the given rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT17 \u2192 't5', NT23 \u2192 't2', NT29 \u2192 't5', NT30 \u2192 't3' or 't4', NT32 \u2192 't1', oh yes! NT32 \u2192 't1'. Because looking at the rules:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT52 NT40, which when expanded could eventually produce t1, but wait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's go step by step. Let's represent each non-terminal and their productions.\n\nNon-terminals and their direct terminals (if any):\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't2' (from NT27 \u2192 NT23 NT27, but wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the actual direct productions where a non-terminal leads to a terminal:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20 (does it ever lead to a terminal? Yes, looking down, NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15, which might lead further.)\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on the 't's in the input and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals produce 't1':\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't2'\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- Others like NT47, NT57, etc., don't have immediate terminals, but let's check if any productions lead to t1.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, perhaps some non-terminals produce combinations that include 't1'. For example, NT39 \u2192 NT56 NT30, and then NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT2, which eventually lead to 't3' and 't4', but that's probably not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44, and NT44 can eventually produce 't4' and 't5' through its productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which non-terminals produce 't1's. Wait, NT32 seems to produce 't1' because I see a rule NT32 \u2192 NT52 NT40, but looking deeper in the rules, does NT32 ever lead directly to 't1'? Or does it produce something that leads to 't1'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list all non-terminals that directly produce tertinals:\n\nLooking at each rule, perhaps those where a non-terminal is followed by a 'a' symbol (the t's with numbers are terminals):\n\n- NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT2 (but '2' is a terminal, so NT44 produces t2)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20 (NT41 and NT20 eventually might produce t's, but not sure here)\n- NT58 \u2192 't3'\n- NT10 \u2192 't2'\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce terminals.

It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions are either two non-terminals or they end with a terminal, so that checks out.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t5 t6 t1 t3 t1 t6 t5 t6 t3 t2 t0 t2 t1 t3 t4 t4 t5 t0 t1 t2 t0 t1 t6 t0 t3 t4 t1 t4 t5 t4 t1 t4 t5 t4 t1 t2 t3 t4 t0 t2`.\n\nI'll need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Starting with S, which is the start symbol, the first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string must start with T28 and T17, but wait, looking at the string, the first two terminals are t5 and t6. Hmm. Wait, but in the grammar, NT17 is a non-terminal. The productions for NT17 are NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT17 \u2192 't5'. So, perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, S becomes NT28 NT17. Now, NT28 can be derived from production NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, let's consider that first. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So now, the string would involve NT17 from S and NT17 and NT7 from NT28.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire string and see if it can be parsed by the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can try to see if it's a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building a parse tree would help. Let's see.\n\nBut since I'm a bit overwhelmed, perhaps I'll first look for the order of terminals that must appear in the string. For example, in the grammar, certain non-terminals produce 't's. For instance, NT17 can produce 't5', and some other non-terminals directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t5, t6, t1, t3, etc. I'll need to see if these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the first part of the string should correspond to NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet's see: NT28 can produce NT17 NT7. So, the first part of the string from NT28 would involve NT17 (producing 't5'), and then NT3 (since NT7 \u2192 't3' or NT2 NT19, etc., but in the given string, after t5 comes t6, which is different. Wait, no: from NT28, the production is NT17 NT7, so the NT28 produces NT17 and NT7. Then, NT17 can produce 't5' or more NTs. But in the string, the next term after t5 is t6.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Terminals here are the 't' followed by numbers, like t5, t3, etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S -> NT28 NT17. So, S starts by producing NT28 and NT17. \n\nI'll need to trace how S can derive the given string. Let's list the string for clarity:\n\nt5, t3, t0, t0, t5, t0, t6, t4, t4, t5, t1, t0, t2, t5, t0, t1, t2, t1, t5, t4, t0, t3, t6, t4, t2, t5, t2, t3, t0, t0, t2, t1, t2, t2, t1, t1, t3, t3, t1, t4, t2.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which produces NT28 and NT17. Each of these needs to produce the respective parts of the string. Let's consider NT28 first.\n\nNT28's production: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So NT28 splits into NT17 and NT7. NT17 produces 't5' according to the given rules: NT17 -> 't5'.\n\nSo the first part of the string should start with 't5' which matches the first token.\n\nNow for NT7: NT7 can produce several things. Looking at the productions for NT7, one of them is NT7 -> NT4 NT48. Let's see what NT4 and NT48 produce.\n\nNT4: NT4 -> NT5 NT36. NT5 produces 't2' as per NT5 -> 't2'. NT36 is 't4', so NT4 becomes 't2' 't4' = t2t4.\n\nNT48: NT48 -> NT1 NT23. NT1 is 't5' and NT23 is 't3', so NT48 is t5t3.\n\nPutting NT7 -> NT4 NT48 together, that's t2t4 t5t3. But wait, let me check. NT4 is t2t4 (since NT4->t2t4 from NT4's production? Wait no, looking back, NT4's production is NT4->NT5 NT36, which is 't2' and 't4', so indeed t2t4. So NT7 becomes t2t4 t5t3, but that doesn't seem to match.\n\nWait, perhaps I should trace it properly. The string starts with t5, so that's from NT17. Then the next part is NT7. So how many symbols do we have after that?\n\nWait, the string is 40 tokens long. Let's note that each non-terminal production has two symbols, so the entire string length should be such that the number of non-terminals and terminals adds up correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either a terminal or a pair. Each string is built from leaves (terminals) corresponding to the production steps.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a stack-based method or try to build the string backward.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols should double each step until terminals are reached. However, the given string seems to have a mix of terminals, so perhaps a single start can't produce it directly. Alternatively, maybe it can, but I need to explore the possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this by seeing if the string can be parsed according to the grammar. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps another approach is to see if the string can be built by recursively applying the grammar. Starting from S, each production splits into two, which in turn can split further, until the terminals match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be decomposed into segments that match the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, maybe the string can be broken down as follows:\n\nStarts with t5, which matches NT17.\n\nThen comes t3, t0, t0, t5, t0, etc.\n\nWait, let me see the breakdown:\n\nt5 (NT17) t3 (NT27?) Wait, no. Wait, according to NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and NT17 is 't5'. So after NT17 (t5), the next part is NT7. So after 't5', the next sequence must be the expansion of NT7.\n\nLooking at the possible expansions for NT7:\n\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT7 -> NT21 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48 (again)\n- Also, another path for NT7: NT7->NT53 NT5 (but that doesn't fit immediately).\n\nWait, but the string after t5 is t3, t0, t0, t5, t0, t6, etc. So t3 is the next symbol after t5, which suggests that NT7 must produce a 't3' at some point.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT7, one of them is NT7 -> NT27 NT17. Wait, no, NT7's production is:\n\nNT7:\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT7 -> NT21 NT9\n- Also, looking back, I see other NT7 productions?

{"custom_id":"request-627","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t0 t4 t1 t0 t1 t4 t6 t2 t4 t6 t1 t0 t0 t5 t5 t2 t6 t0 t3 t0 t1 t2 t2 t1 t5 t2 t2 t3 t0 t6 t6 t2 t3 t0 t6 t3 t5 t6 t2 t0 t0`. Hmm, that's a bit long, but let's see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or terminals. Since this grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, it should follow this structure. Also, I notice that the grammar includes terminating symbols like 't0', 't1', etc., which means the language consists of strings composed of these terminals.\n\nNow, the string in question is entirely composed of 't' followed by numbers like t0, t1, t2, up to t6. So, each token is a terminal symbol. My goal is to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce these terminal symbols. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, but that's a two-step production. Wait, actually, the grammar's right-hand side only consists of non-terminals, except when a rule directly produces a terminal. Let me check each rule to see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT36\n- ... and so on\n\nWait, actually, some rules like NT17 -> 't3', NT20 -> 't3', NT2 -> 't5', etc. So, these are the production rules where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal symbol.\n\nThis means that the grammar has productions that directly emit these terminals, which are the leaf nodes. So, when generating the string, the derivation would involve applying these production rules until only terminals are left.\n\nNow, the given string starts with t0. Let's look for which non-terminals produce 't0'. From the rules, I see that NT0 -> 't5'. Hmm, that's 't5', which isn't 't0'. Wait, maybe I need to trace back. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong rule.\n\nWait, looking again, I think I may have misread. Let me check the rules more carefully.\n\nI see:\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT20 -> 't3'\n- NT2 -> 't5'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT21 -> 't0'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT17 -> 't5' (Wait, is there a rule where NT17 -> 't5'? Let me check again.)\n\nLooking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me list out the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'? No, NT7 has productions with non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a map of which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT17: NT17 -> 't3'\n\nNT20: NT20 -> 't3'\n\nNT2: NT2 -> 't5'\n\nNT27: NT27 -> 't6'\n\nNT3: NT3 -> 't3'\n\nNT6: NT6 -> 't4'\n\nNT9: NT9 -> 't3'\n\nNT52: NT52 -> 't2'\n\nNT32: NT32 -> 't1'\n\nNT15: NT15 -> 't0'\n\nNT21: NT21 -> 't0'\n\nSo, the non-terminals NT17, NT20, NT2, NT27, NT3, NT6, NT9, NT52, NT32, NT15, and NT21 each produce a single terminal symbol, which can be matched in the string.\n\nNow, to generate the given string, the derivation must start from the start symbol S and apply productions until only terminals remain, matching the sequence.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, according to the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo, the first two symbols in the string must be produced by NT28 and NT17. However, looking at the production for S, it's NT28 and NT17. But let's check what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT17 -> 't3'\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7 (Wait, no: NT28: Let's check the rules.\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT28: NT28 -> NT44 NT13\n\nWait, but that's a production into non-terminals. Let me see if any non-terminals produce NT28 or NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me outline:\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 and NT17 are non-terminals. We need to derive expressions for each of these.\n\nLet's process NT17 first since it's a terminal ('t3'). So, the first symbol in the string is t0, which is not 't3' or 't2', etc. Wait, the string starts with t0, so the initial production S must be able to produce t0 in the first symbol, but S's production starts with NT28 NT17, which would produce two terminals if possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, and I think I missed some.\n\nWait, let me look again. The initial rules include:\n\nNT57 -> NT13 NT47\n\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30\n\nWait, that seems like it might be a typo, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree.\n\nBut since the string is long, I need a better strategy. Maybe I can use the fact that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form and apply the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nWait, the CYK algorithm is used to parse context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form for a given string. However, since the given string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with all the details of the CYK algorithm in this specific context, but perhaps I can find out if the string can be split into valid substrings according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or check if all symbols in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: let's identify which non-terminals can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nEach terminal symbol ('t0', 't1', etc.) is produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nt0 is produced by NT15 and NT21.\n\nt1 is produced by NT32, NT12, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, the rules that produce terminals are:\n\nNT15 -> 't0'\n\nNT21 -> 't0'\n\nNT32 -> 't1'\n\nNT12 is not a terminal, it produces other things.\n\nWait, let me correct the list:\n\nTerminals are:\n\n- NT15: 't0'\n\n- NT21: 't0'\n\n- NT32: 't1'\n\n- NT17: 't3'\n\n- NT2: 't5'\n\n- NT27: 't6'\n\n- NT6: 't4'\n\n- NT9: 't3'\n\nBut the string has more than just these. Wait, the string is:\n\nt0 t4 t1 t0 t1 t4 t6 t2 t4 t6 t1 t0 t0 t5 t5 t2 t6 t0 t3 t0 t1 t2 t2 t1 t5 t2 t2 t3 t0 t6 t6 t2 t3 t0 t6 t3 t5 t6 t2 t0 t0\n\nWait, the symbols in the string are:\n\n- t0: appears multiple times\n\n- t4: appears multiple times\n\n- t1: appears in positions as well\n\n- t5: appears multiple times\n\n- t2: also appears\n\n- t6: appears\n\n- t3: appears\n\nSo, according to the grammar, all terminal symbols in the string have corresponding non-terminals that can produce them as per the mappings above. So, for example:\n\n- t0 is from NT15 or NT21.\n\n- t4 is produced by NT52 (as NT52->'t2'), wait no: wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT5"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex, so I'll have to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note the grammar provided. It's in CNF, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it has several production rules leading to terminals 't0' to 't6' and perhaps others, but only these terminals are present in the target string. The string to evaluate is \"t2 t6 t2 t0 t3 t2 t2 t3 t1 t6 t3 t0 t4 t4 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t0 t2 t3 t2 t1 t4 t0 t1 t4 t5 t5 t0 t6 t1 t3 t6 t6 t0 t5 t6 t1 t5 t3\".\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation multiplies the non-terminals, each expanding into two more non-terminals until the terminals are reached. So, the string should have a length that's a power of 2, as each application of the productions increases the number of string elements by a power of 2. Let's check: the string has 47 tokens. \n\nWait, 2^n must equal 47, but 47 is not a power of 2. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. Since 47 is not a power of 2, that immediately suggests the string cannot be generated by this grammar. However, I should verify if my understanding is correct.\n\nIn CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, so each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals. Therefore, the length of the derived string must be a power of 2, as each step doubles the number of symbols. For example, starting with one non-terminal, after one step, there are two non-terminals, after two steps, four terminals, and so on. So if the original grammar starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which would expand into two non-terminals, and each subsequent expansion adds more non-terminals until the terminals are produced.\n\nGiven that the target string has a length of 47, which isn't a power of 2, this isn't possible. Therefore, the answer should be \"No\".\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe the starting rule produces more than two symbols in some way, but looking at the grammar, all production rules produce exactly two non-terminals except some that end in terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5' is a terminal, so that's a production that stops the expansion. So the structure of the string should have a hierarchical depth where each split is a binary tree, leading to a length that's 2^k. Since 47 isn't possible, the string is definitely not derivable.\n\nSo, I'm confident now that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because its length isn't a power of two.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

However, I see that some of the productions include terminals, like in the bottom of the grammar where rules like S->NT28 NT17 are given, but also more terminal rules like NT1->'t3'. Wait, no, actually the grammar as given has both non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side because the last lines have 't0', 't1', etc. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, in CNF, all productions are of the form A->BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. But some of the rules here have terminals, which might mean this isn't exactly CNF. Or maybe I'm misremembering. Oh, but looking at the grammar, the production NT1->'t3' is a terminal symbol, which would be allowed in some normal form, but perhaps in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals except the start symbols.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. Actually, the grammar provided includes rules where non-terminals produce two terminals, which would not be standard CNF. So perhaps this is actually not in CNF? Or maybe the initial assumption is that the grammar is in CNF if all non-terminals produce two non-terminals, but here we have some non-terminals that produce a mix of non-terminals and terminals, like NT1->'t3' which is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking again, many rules have both non-terminals and terminals, like S->NT28 NT17, which are both non-terminals. NT1->'t3' is a terminal. So, to clarify, this grammar is not in Chomsky Normal Form because some productions have terminal symbols on the right-hand side. However, in some cases, production rules can have mix of non-terminals and terminals, especially for the start symbol. So perhaps this is an ambiguous point, but for the purpose of this problem, I'll proceed as given.\n\nThe string consists entirely of terminal tokens: 't0', 't1', 't2', etc. Our goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string is 39 tokens long. The grammar might generate strings through multiple levels of recursion, and each production might contribute a fixed number of tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level rule is S->NT28 NT17. So S produces two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. Then, each of those could produce more non-terminals or a combination, eventually leading to terminal symbols.\n\nI think the best approach is to perform a derivation step by step, trying to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S, it splits into NT28 and NT17. Then each of those splits further, and so on, until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, perhaps a better approach is to analyze the grammar's structure and the possible lengths of the generated strings to see if 39 is possible.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production seems to either produce two non-terminals that further split or eventually produce terminal symbols.\n\nEach rule of the grammar in CNF (assuming some terminals) would have a certain length when expanded, typically leading to exponential growth in the number of possible strings, but each step adds a specific number of symbols.\n\nWait, no, in a typical two-symbol production (CNF), the number of symbols would be 2^n for n levels, but the presence of terminals complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production leads to a specific number of steps, and each step replaces a non-terminal with a sequence that contributes a certain fixed number of symbols, perhaps 2 or more.\n\nBut in this case, some production rules have two non-terminals, and others might eventually resolve to terminals, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the number of possible steps. For example, S->NT28 NT17. Each NT28 and NT17 could be replaced further.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28->NT17 NT7. Then NT17->NT1 NT58, etc. It's getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to count the number of terminal tokens that a derivation would produce.\n\nWait, maybe the given string requires 39 terminal symbols, which is an odd number, but from S->NT28 NT17, each step adds two symbols (non-terminals), perhaps each final expansion adds an even number of terminals.\n\nBut 39 is odd, so perhaps it's impossible. Wait, but in the string, the count is 39 tokens, which would require an odd number of terminal symbols, but starting from S->NT28 NT17, which adds two non-terminals, each of those might add two non-terminals, and so on, each time the number of non-terminals would be powers of two, which might generate an even number of terminals only. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because some production rules might produce a terminal and a non-terminal, which could change the count.\n\nWait, for example, if one of the production rules for a non-terminal is NT->'t0' NT, then that would produce one terminal and one non-terminal, which when replaced further, might add a variable number.\n\nAlternatively, considering all the productions, perhaps each production either adds a terminal and a non-terminal, leading to an odd count when all are expanded, or even.\n\nWait, but 39 is quite a large count, and I need to see if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree would help.

The string is a sequence of tokens: t1, t3, t2, etc., and I need to figure out if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) consists of productions where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all rules are in the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which means S produces NT28 followed by NT17. Similarly, NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47, which is another two non-terminals. There are a few terminals, mostly 't' followed by a number, like t1, t3, etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t1 t3 t1 t5 t5 t6 t0 t3 t4 t3 t6 t3 t1 t5 t5 t6 t1 t1 t4 t1 t6 t0 t5 t5 t3 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t3 t5 t6 t5 t0 t6 t4 t2.\n\nSo, my approach is to see if this string can be formed by starting from S and applying the productions step by step until I get exactly this sequence of terminals.\n\nI'll start by identifying the structure of the string and see if it can be split into the required non-terminals.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t1. Let's look at the productions for terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 t5, as seen in NT17 -> 't5'. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT17, it has a production to 't5'. So, NT17 can derive the terminal 't5'. Similarly, there are other non-terminals that produce different 't' terms.\n\nThe first token is t1. So, I need to find a production that yields 't1'. Looking through the rules, I see that NT27 \u2192 t6, NT15 \u2192 t0, etc. Wait, is there a non-terminal that produces 't1'? Checking all the productions, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly goes to 't1'. Hmm, that might be a problem because the first token is t1, but none of the non-terminals produce t1.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan all the rules again. I see rules like NT13 \u2192 NT45 NT26, and NT46 \u2192 't3' and 't2'? Wait, looking at the rules, I see some that terminate with terminals. For example, NT21 eventually can produce t0 or t4. Wait, but no 't1' seems to be produced by any non-terminal directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check the productions for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't1'. So if the string starts with 't1', but none of the non-terminals can produce 't1', that would make it impossible for the grammar to generate this string. Unless maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, let me check the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking at the list, I see rules like NT3 \u2192 t3, NT6 \u2192 t4, NT9 \u2192 t3, NT21 \u2192 t0, NT32 \u2192 t1, etc. Oh, wait, there is a rule NT32 \u2192 t1. So, where is NT32? Looking through the rules, NT32 can be produced from NT30 NT3, as per NT30 -> NT44 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT32 is given as NT30 -> NT15 NT30. That's a production of NT30, not NT32. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, the production NT30 -> NT15 NT30 is for NT30, not NT32.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT32 has a rule: NT30 -> NT15 NT30 \u2192 but that's for NT30. For NT32, the rule is that NT30 produces something else. Wait, no: looking more carefully, under NT3, one of the productions is NT33 \u2192 t3, which seems incorrect. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NT rules.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t2 (NT7 -> t2)\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT33 \u2192 t3\n- NT52 \u2192 t2\n- NT32 \u2192 t1 (Wait, is there a rule? Looking for 't1':)\n\nWait, I see NT32 \u2192 t1. Yes, looking at the list under NT39: NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46, and so on. Wait, in the given list:\n\nLooking line by line, I find:\n\nNT27 -> t6\nNT15 -> t0\nNT21 -> t0\nNT38 -> t4\nNT17 -> t5\nNT32 -> t1\n\nYes, so NT32 \u2192 t1. So, 't1' can be directly derived from NT32.\n\nSo, the start symbol is S. S can derive NT28 NT17, as per the production S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nFrom there, each of these non-terminals would produce their own sequences. Let's simulate this process.\n\nThe string starts with 't1', so the first token must be produced by a non-terminal that has 't1' in its derivation. From the above, NT32 can produce 't1'. So, perhaps NT17 \u2192 't5' and NT28 can produce something else.\n\nWait, actually, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string will be the concatenation of NT28's string and NT17's string. The first token is 't1', so let's see what NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT17 \u2192 t5 (from the rule NT17 -> 't5').\n\nSo, if NT17 produces 't5', that would be the second token. But the string starts with 't1', so that can't be right. Therefore, maybe NT17 is not the first part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT28 produces 't1' and NT17 produces another part. Let me look into NT28's productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33. So, NT28 can derive NT14 followed by NT33. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT14: Looking at the productions, NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5. So, NT14 can produce NT53 and NT5.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar and see if it can be fully consumed.\n\nI'll start by building a stack or list representing the current string to parse, and attempt to reduce it step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string to parse is:\n\nt1 t3 t1 t5 t5 t6 t0 t3 t4 t3 t6 t3 t1 t5 t5 t6 t1 t1 t4 t1 t6 t0 t5 t5 t3 t4 t4 t2 t0 t3 t2 t0 t3 t4 t1 t3 t5 t6 t5 t0 t6 t4 t2\n\nLet's write this as a list, starting with S:\n\nList = [S]\n\nWe'll process each token, applying the productions until the list is empty. Let's proceed step by step. Each step, we'll look for a production that matches the current list.\n\nStep 1: List = [S]\n\nS can derive NT28 NT17. So, replace S with NT28 NT17.\n\nList = [NT28, NT17]\n\nStep 2: [NT28, NT17]\n\nNext, we process NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33.\n\nSo, replace NT28 with NT14 NT33.\n\nList becomes [NT14, NT33, NT17]\n\nStep 3: [NT14, NT33, NT17]\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5.\n\nReplace NT14 with NT53 NT5.\n\nList = [NT53, NT5, NT33, NT17]\n\nStep 4: [NT53, NT5, NT33, NT17"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The provided grammar meets this criterion, so that's good.\n\nThe string starts with `t1`, which is a terminal symbol. Looking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals derive to `t` symbols. For example, `NT54` can derive directly to `t3`, and `NT27` to `t6`, and `NT2` to `t5` via `NT54` which eventually becomes `t3`. But wait, looking at the provided mappings at the end of the grammar, it seems some non-terminals directly produce terminals. The string has `t1`, which I need to check if the grammar allows for that.\n\nChecking the end productions, `NT1` is `T1`, so yes, `t1` is allowed. Next, `t6` \u2014 looking through the productions, does any non-terminal produce `t6`? Scanning the production rules, I don't immediately see a production that ends with `t6`, except perhaps through chain productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's produced by another rule. Wait, looking at the end productions:\n\nAt the end of the grammar, I see:\n- `NT36 -> 't4'`\n- `NT29 -> 't5'`\n- `NT30 -> 't4'`\n- `NT30 -> 't3'`\n- `NT20 -> 't4'`\n- `NT20 -> 't3'`\n- `NT2 -> 't5'`\n- `NT27 -> 't6'`\n- `NT3 -> 't3'`\n- `NT6 -> 't4'`\n- `NT9 -> 't3'`\n- `NT52 -> 't2'`\n- `NT32 -> 't1'`\n- `NT15 -> 't0'`\n- `NT21 -> 't0'`\n- `NT38 -> 't4'`\n- `NT17 -> 't5'`\n- `NT27 -> 't1'`\n- `NT33 -> 't3'`\n- `NT33 -> 't6'`\n- `NT4 -> 't2'`\n- `NT11 -> 't2'`\n- `NT0 -> 't5'`\n\nWait, I see `NT33 -> 't3'` and `NT33 -> 't6'`. So when `NT33` is derived, it can produce `t3` or `t6`. So that's how `t6` can come in.\n\nThe string starts with `t1`, which is directly produced by `NT54` (since `NT1` produces `t1`, but `t1` is also in the end productions for `NT29` and others. Wait, no: looking at the end productions, `NT32 -> 't1'`. So `NT32` can produce `t1`. So `NT32` can derive `t1` directly.\n\nWait, so the first `t1` comes from `NT32`.\n\nThen, the next token is `t6`, which as above comes from `NT33`.\n\nNext is `t0`. Looking at the end productions, only `NT30` can produce `t4` and `t3`, but no `t0` except through combining non-terminals. Wait, looking at the end productions, I see that `NT29 -> 't5'`, but `NT21` and `NT15` both produce `t0`. So `t0` can come from `NT15` or `NT21`.\n\nWait, so how is `t0` possible. It seems that to get `t0`, we need a rule that produces `t0` as a terminal. Looking at the end productions:\n\n- `NT21 -> 't0'`\n- `NT15 -> 't0'`\n\nSo either `NT15` or `NT21` can produce `t0`.\n\nProceeding, the string after `t1 t6 t0` is `t4 t4 t2...`. So let's think about how this could be generated.\n\nThe string is pretty long, so perhaps the approach is to try to parse it from the start symbol S and see if it can derive the given string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to see if each `t` symbol can be mapped back to a production in the grammar, and see if a sequence of such mappings forms a valid derivation.\n\nLooking at the entire string:\n\nt1 t6 t0 t4 t4 t2 t1 t4 t3 t5 t0 t2 t2 t6 t0 t2 t3 t4 t1 t5 t1 t3 t1 t3 t6 t5 t6 t1 t6 t2 t5 t2 t2 t6 t0 t5 t0 t0 t4 t5 t2 t0 t2.\n\nLet me check each `t` symbol and see if it can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\n1. t1: Possible from NT32 (since NT32 -> 't1').\n\n2. t6: Possible from NT33 (since NT33 -> 't6').\n\n3. t0: Possible from NT15 or NT21.\n\n4. t4: Possible from NT27, NT32, NT17, etc.\n\n5. t4: Same as above.\n\n6. t2: From NT52, NT21, etc.\n\n7. t1: From NT32.\n\n8. t4: Same.\n\n9. t3: From NT3, NT27, etc.\n\n10. t5: From NT54, NT17, etc.\n\n11. t0: From NT15 or NT21.\n\n12. t2: From NT52, etc.\n\n13. t2: Same.\n\n14. t6: From NT33.\n\n15. t0: Again, NT15 or NT21.\n\n16. t2: Same as before.\n\n17. t3: From NT3 or others.\n\n18. t4: From NT27, etc.\n\n19. t1: From NT32.\n\n20. t5: From NT54, etc.\n\n21. t1: Same.\n\n22. t3: From NT27 or others.\n\n23. t1: Same.\n\n24. t3: Same.\n\n25. t6: From NT33.\n\n26. t5: From NT54, etc.\n\n27. t6: Same.\n\n28. t1: Same.\n\n29. t6: Same.\n\n30. t2: Same.\n\n31. t5: Same.\n\n32. t2: Same.\n\n33. t2: Same.\n\n34. t6: Same.\n\n35. t0: Same.\n\n36. t5: Same.\n\n37. t0: Same.\n\n38. t0: Same.\n\n39. t4: Same.\n\n40. t5: Same.\n\n41. t2: Same.\n\n42. t0: Same.\n\n43. t2: Same.\n\nSo every `t` symbol seems to have a corresponding production. However, the question is whether there's a valid derivation in the grammar that can produce the entire string.\n\nBut context-free grammars can have multiple ways to derive the same string, but the key is whether each `t` can be traced back through the productions. Alternatively, perhaps the string is shorter than expected or some `t` symbols might not align with the grammar's structure.\n\nWait, another approach is to count the number of symbols. The string is 48 tokens long. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. The initial string S starts with two non-terminals (S -> NT28 NT17). Each step increases the number of symbols by one, so for a string of length n, starting from two symbols, the number of steps is n-2.\n\nFor a string of 48 symbols, we'd have 46 steps.\n\nBut if I can't keep track of each step, perhaps another approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to find a path from S through the productions that can generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be generated using the given rules. Let's consider possible subparts.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT28 NT17.

{"custom_id":"request-657","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the string is a series of tokens: `t6 t1 t0 t4 t2 t0 t6 t0 t4 t2 t5 t0 t3 t2 t3 t1 t4 t1 t5 t6 t5 t6 t5 t3 t3 t2 t4 t1 t0 t2 t2 t1 t4 t1 t2 t4 t2 t2 t4 t3 t3 t4 t2 t4`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, I need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S, using these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first step is to see what S generates. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Wait, but in the string, do I see 't28' or 't17'? No, all the tokens are 't6', 't1', etc. So, S is broken down into two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. But the string doesn't have these non-terminals; instead, it has terminals like t6, t1, etc.\n\nWait, maybe the NT28 and NT17 are actually terminal symbols. Let me check the productions of NT28 and NT17. In the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT28 can be divided into more non-terminals. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. But in the provided string, the first token is t6. Hmm, that might not fit unless NT28 or NT17 directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again: The only terminals in the grammar are 't0', 't1', up to 't6'. Each of these is a terminal symbol. So, NT3, NT5, etc., must be producing these terminals. For instance, NT53 \u2192 't3' and so on.\n\nSo, maybe I need to look for a path from S to the string by replacing non-terminals with terminals. The given string seems to be a sequence of these terminals, so I think each production step should expand a non-terminal into two others until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut with the given grammar, the only way a non-terminal can produce a terminal is if there's a production like NTx \u2192 a, where a is a terminal like 't3'. For example, NT3 \u2192 't3' perhaps? Wait, looking back, I see NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 and NT55 \u2192 NT29 NT54, and NT29 \u2192 NT5 NT53, NT53 \u2192 NT44 NT21. Hmm, that's a lot of non-terminals. Or maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's look at the rules again. Let me check if there are any non-terminals that directly produce a terminal. Yes, looking down, some of them do:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n- NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21\n- NT11 \u2192 various\nWait, actually, I see that some non-terminals have productions ending with a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, which might produce 't2' in some cases, or maybe NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT44, but that's non-terminal. I think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals in the grammar are only the t0-t6, and everything else (like NT28, NT7, etc.) are non-terminals. So, each non-terminal must produce two other non-terminals, except when a production ends with a terminal. For example, if NT28 has a production like NT28 \u2192 t6 NTX, that would mean NT28 can produce a terminal 't6' followed by another non-terminal.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t6. So, if S \u2192 NT28 NT17, then NT28 should produce 't6' as a terminal. Let me check if NT28 has a production that includes a terminal. From the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\nNT17 \u2192 NT14 NT57\nWait, looking further, do any of these produce terminals? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 't2'\n- NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n- Wait, no, I see NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT44 't1' because earlier it said NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26, then inside NT20 it's NT23 NT2, etc., but perhaps in the lower levels, some non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to see if each step of the string can be derived by replacing non-terminals with terminals. But since the string starts with t6, I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any production where, say, NTx \u2192 't6'. So that might mean that t6 must be produced indirectly through a series of non-terminals. Or perhaps each step breaks down into two non-terminals, each of which eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, let me try tracing the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t6, t1, t0, t4, t2, t0, t6, t0, t4, t2, t5, t0, t3, t2, t3, t1, t4, t1, t5, t6, t5, t6, t5, t3, t3, t2, t4, t1, t0, t2, t2, t1, t4, t1, t2, t4, t2, t2, t4, t3, t3, t4, t2, t4.\n\nThat's 40 tokens. Since each production step in the grammar leads to two symbols, the number of symbols in the string should be equal to 2^n - 1 for some n because each step doubles the number of symbols minus one (if starting with one). But that seems complicated, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar starts with S, which breaks down into two non-terminals: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string must be produced by expanding these non-terminals.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t6. So, either NT28 or NT17 must expand into t6 and another term.\n\nWait, maybe S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, if we replace NT28 with something that can produce t6 and something else, but I don't see any NT producing t6 directly. Hmm. Maybe I need to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for whether the string can be parsed by the given grammar. But doing that manually would be tedious.\n\nWait, perhaps I can check the structure of the grammar. Each production is in Chomsky Normal Form, so it's a binary tree of derivations.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the first token t6, so I need to find a derivation that starts with t6. So, either NT28 or NT17 can derive t6 in combination with another terminal.\n\nBut looking again, in the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7; NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58; NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19; and so on. None of these seem to produce t6.\n\nWait, perhaps in the hierarchy, at a lower level, a non-terminal expands into 't6'. But I don't see any such production. For example, in some expansions, like NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, I think NT36 may produce some terminal.\n\nWait, looking into NT36: from the grammar, I don't see NT36, but maybe some other non-terminals do. Wait, no, according to the given grammar, NT36 is a production, but in some of the rules, I see NT36 in the breakdown of NT53. Wait, for example:\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44\nNT44 \u2192 NT53 NT5\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can see that 't6' is derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the start symbol S. It's divided into two non-terminals, say A and B. The string starts with t6, so perhaps one of A or B must derive t6, followed by another symbol. But since t6 is a terminal, it must come from a non-terminal that directly produces t6, or through a chain of non-terminals in a way that the entire string is composed of terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Another idea: perhaps I can assign to each non-terminal the possible terminals it can produce when"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-649","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's and numbers like 't4 t3 t0...' up to 't...'.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. In CNF, each production rule has either a single non-terminal on the left or two non-terminals on the right. The only exception is the start symbol generating the empty string, but here I don't see that case because all the rules seem to produce non-empty strings.\n\nWait, looking more closely, some productions end with 'tN', which I think represents terminal symbols. So the grammar is in CNF because each production has two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal on the right. Wait, no. CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol can produce \u03b5. But here, some productions like S \u2192 NT28 NT17 are two non-terminals on the right, which is fine for CNF. But looking at other rules, like NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, which are two non-terminals. But some rules end with 'tN', meaning a terminal on the right. Wait, but in CNF, right-hand sides must consist of exactly two non-terminals. So that can't be, because if a production has a terminal, that would mean it's in Greibach Normal Form (GNF). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But wait, that's actually Greibach Normal Form (GNF), which requires terminals as the first symbol on the RHS. Chomsky Normal Form, on the other hand, allows any two non-terminals on the RHS, with the start symbol possibly producing a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: Chomsky Normal Form is when every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So that includes both non-terminals and terminals as single symbols on the RHS, but I think only for the start symbol? Or do all productions except the start have to follow that?\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but a must be a terminal symbol for all non-start symbols. Or is that only for start symbol?\n\nI think that's incorrect. Let's get clear.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each production must be of the form:\n\n- A \u2192 B C, or\n- A \u2192 a,\n\nwhere A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. The only exception is that the start symbol can produce \u03b5, but in our case, the start symbol is S, and its productions are all into non-terminals, so that's okay.\n\nSo in our grammar, the RHS of each production can be two non-terminals or a single terminal. So for example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is a production with two non-terminals on RHS, which fits CNF. However, looking at other productions like NT3 \u2192 NT44 NT13, which is two non-terminals. But wait, I also see productions like NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT33, which are two non-terminals, and others like NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, which is a terminal. So in that case, NT4 \u2192 a, where a is a terminal? So that would fit CNF because it's a single terminal on the RHS.\n\nWait, so in the given grammar, all production rules have either two non-terminals on RHS or a single terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 is two non-terminals, but wait, no, NT5 is a non-terminal, and NT36 is a non-terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT36 is on the RHS. Wait, in the grammar, do the RHS only consist of non-terminals except when the RHS is a terminal? Or are all RHSs of productions two non-terminals, but some of those non-terminals are actually terminals?\n\nWait, no. The grammar has both types. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17: two non-terminals. NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9: two non-terminals, and NT9 is a terminal. Wait, no: looking back, in the grammar, some NT entries have productions ending with 'tN', which I think are terminals. Hmm, perhaps the grammar uses 'tN' to denote terminals that are identifiers like t1, t2, etc. So 't3' is a terminal symbol, and NT entries are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the production rules are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTxw or NTxy \u2192 tN, where tN is a terminal. So in that case, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nBut in our case, to apply CYK algorithm or to parse the string manually, I need to see the steps. Alternatively, I can try to see if each step in the derivation can match the given string.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't's and numbers: 't4 t3 t0 t2 t3 t2 t5 t4 t0 t2 t3 t6 t6 t3 t4 t4 t4 t2 t4 t0 t0 t1 t4 t0 t2 t2 t3 t0 t4 t6 t1 t6 t2 t4 t4 t2 t2 t1 t3 t4 t4 t2 t1 t0'. So, the string is a sequence of 40 tokens, each being a terminal (any t followed by a number or just a number? Wait, the string starts with 't4', so it's a terminal, then 't3', and so on.\n\nWait, let me list all tokens:\n\nt4, t3, t0, t2, t3, t2, t5, t4, t0, t2, t3, t6, t6, t3, t4, t4, t4, t2, t4, t0, t0, t1, t4, t0, t2, t2, t3, t0, t4, t6, t1, t6, t2, t4, t4, t2, t2, t1, t3, t4, t4, t2, t1, t0.\n\nHmm, each 'tN' is a terminal, where N is the number. Now, each of these terminals must match the sequence of terminals generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, to check if the grammar can derive this string, we can model this as a parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step combines two non-terminals into terminals, which could have been produced by previous steps.\n\nGiven the size of the string, it's quite long, so perhaps it's better to look for any patterns or loops that could have generated this string. Alternatively, maybe we can find the steps in the derivation by working backwards.\n\nBut let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at the entire string length: 40 tokens. Each production in CNF generates either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, the number of symbols in the parse tree would depend on the number of productions used.\n\nWait, in CYK parsing, we can represent the possible non-terminals that can derive a substring of the string. But maybe there's an easier way here.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the sequence can be divided into steps starting from S and breaking down into non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that the start symbol is S, which in the first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, to derive the entire string, it must start with NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, each NT28 and NT17 must produce some sequence of terminals. So let's see what NT28 can produce:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nNT28 can derive NT17 and NT7. Then, each of those can further derive other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me make a tree:\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nThen, NT17 can be expanded. From the grammar, NT17 has several productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17's productions are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, and looking into NT1 and NT58:\n\nNT1: Looking at the grammar, NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15.\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15.\n\nLooking at NT45: NT45 \u2192 NT56 NT33.\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT3 NT2.\n\nWait, NT3 is NT3 \u2192 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so like t3 t3 t3... up to t5. The grammar has several productions that lead to terminals like t0, t1, etc., so I need to see if each part of the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t3 t3 t3. Let me check where t3 comes from. In the grammar, NT3 is defined as NT19 NT55. Let me see what comes after NT19 and NT55. NT19 is NT4 NT30, and NT55 is NT29 NT54. Wait, no, I think I need to look at each production for t3.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT3 is defined as NT19 NT55. Let me check NT19: it's NT4 NT30. NT4 is NT5 NT36, and NT36 is 't5'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar's productions for terminals like NT4 are defined as NT13 NT3, but wait, actually some of the rules end with 't' instead of non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking carefully, some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal. For example, NT17 \u2192 't3', but looking for 't3' in the grammar, I see that NT3 is NT19 NT55, which is a non-terminal, so it doesn't produce 't3' directly. Instead, NT19 is NT4 NT30, and so on.\n\nLet me try to find how a part of the string can be generated. Maybe I should consider the rightmost derivation approach since I'm trying to see if each 't' in the string is correctly generated.\n\nWait, let me think step by step:\n\nThe string is: t3 t3 t3 t1 t3 t6 t1 t2 t1 t1 t6 t4 t4 t4 t1 t1 t3 t5 t3 t3 t0 t4 t6 t2 t2 t2 t0 t5 t5 t4 t3 t1 t2 t6 t1 t2 t2 t4 t4 t3 t1 t1 t4 t3 t3.\n\nThat's a lot. Let's see if there's a way to parse this. Maybe I should look for the first t3, see where it comes from, and then check the following part.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only rule that starts with t3 is NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, as NT3 is a non-terminal. Then, each of those non-terminals needs to produce t3. Wait, no, NT19 is NT4 NT30, but that's not a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 t3, NT9 \u2192 t3, NT3 \u2192 t3, NT1 \u2192 t5, etc. Hmm, looking at the rules provided, I see that NT3 \u2192 t3? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n\nWait, that's not a terminal. But looking elsewhere, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t3. Yes, because in the grammar, there's a production NT3 -> t3. So NT3 can directly produce t3.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t3 t3 t3 t1... So maybe the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so NT28 and NT17.\n\nStarting with NT28:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S starts as NT28 NT17, which is NT17 NT7 followed by NT28 (wait, no: S is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so the start is NT28, which produces NT17 NT7. So the first part would be NT17 and NT7 on the left.\n\nWait, that might mean that the first token comes from NT7. Let me check: NT7 has several productions. For example, NT7 \u2192 t2 t19, but wait, perhaps NT7 can produce t3 directly. Looking at the grammar, there is ND7 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo if NT7 \u2192 t3, then that's the first t3. So the first token is t3 from NT7.\n\nThen, the second token is also t3, so perhaps the next NT7 also gives t3. Similarly, the third t3 could come from NT7 again.\n\nSo maybe after three t3s, the next part t1 t3... comes from another part.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline a possible derivation.\n\nLet me think about the first three t3s. If the first token comes from NT7 \u2192 t3, the second from another NT7 \u2192 t3, and the third from another, but NT7 only has certain productions. Wait, looking at the grammar again, NT7 has the following productions:\n\nNT7 -> t2 t19\nNT7 -> t13 t30\nNT7 -> t4 t48\n\nAnd earlier, I saw that NT7 can produce t3 via NT3, but wait, no, NT7's direct productions are above. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT3 \u2192 t3. So if a NT3 node is derived, it becomes t3.\n\nBut looking at NT7's productions, NT7 can also reach NT3? For example, NT7 can go to NT4 NT48. Then, NT4 is NT5 NT36. NT5 is NT43 NT24. Hmm, but NT36 is 't5' or maybe derived from something else.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe it's better to approach the problem by trying to parse the string from the end using a bottom-up approach or by seeing if each part can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the parse tree level by level.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, this might take a while, but perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Check the order of non-terminals in the start production.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which is NT28 NT17. So the initial part must have NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28: production is NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT7, which gives us two non-terminals: NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, NT17 has productions, one of which is \u2192 t5, and another is \u2192 t5, maybe. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't5' is present under NT17 is defined as NT17 \u2192 t5 and also perhaps others. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5', and also other productions like NT17 \u2192 t5? Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, actually, looking at the production rules, there might be multiple NT17 rules. For example, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' is defined as NT17 \u2192 t5, and also as NT17 \u2192 t5? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, some rules produce a single 't' character directly. For example:\n\nNT1 \u2192 t5\n\nHT26? No, wait, in the grammar, looking for where 't' followed by a number appears.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nI see NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT20, which isn't t. But looking for production rules that have a terminal as their right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminal symbols like 't3', 't5', etc., are produced by certain non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 t3, NT13 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nWait, but let me make a list of which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t3\n\nNT5 \u2192 t0? No, I see NT0 \u2192 t5, but looking back:\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NT0 is defined as NT26 NT46? No, looking carefully, the grammar ends with:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t5.\n\nYes, looking at the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t5.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 t5, as per one of the productions.\n\nWait, checking further:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t5\n\nalso\n\nNT17 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' and also another production for NT17? Looking again:\n\nIn the bottom part:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t5.\n\nSo NT17 can produce t5.\n\nSo, with that in mind, when NT17 is a non-terminal, it can produce 't5'.\n\nBut in the start production S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo the first part is NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of non-terminals like S, NT17, NT57, etc., and terminals like t3, t5, t2, etc.\n\nI think the best approach here is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is quite long, maybe I can spot patterns or look for key productions that could generate the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are only single letters: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and the non-terminals are all NT followed by a number. But wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a terminal, like S -> NT28 NT17. But further down, I see NT1 -> t5, which is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014the grammar shows that some non-terminals produce a terminal, like NT1 -> t5. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, looking back: the grammar has entries like NT1 -> t5. Wait, no, looking more carefully: actually, the grammar doesn't show any non-terminals directly producing terminals. Instead, in CNF, terminals are only produced by the start symbol through a series of productions. Or maybe the grammar's start symbol S eventually produces strings of terminals via non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT28 NT17. Both NT28 and NT17 are non-terminals, which in turn produce other non-terminals or perhaps terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, all non-terminals are defined as combinations of other non-terminals except for those that directly produce terminals. Wait, but in the list above, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> NT55 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT53 -> NT6 NT56\n- NT56 -> NT3 NT52\n- NT52 -> NT20 NT36\n- NT36 -> NT52 NT35\n- NT35 -> NT21 NT6\n- NT21 -> NT35 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT3\n- Wait, I don't see any NT productions directly producing a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I should parse the given grammar to understand the production rules. Each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Let me list out key rules to get an idea.\n\nNoticing the main start symbol is S, which immediately goes to NT28 NT17. So the string must start with t5 (which is the result of NT28) and t2 (from NT17? Wait, looking at the terminals: NT28 \u2192 t2 and NT17 \u2192 t3. Oh, wait the terminals are t0 to t6. Wait, actually, looking at the 'NT28' productions, I see NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. And NT7 can produce t5. So NT28 may produce t2 or t5, depending on the rules.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the terminal mappings:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 \u2192 which are terminals t2 and t5 (since NT2 is t2 and NT19 is t5)\nWait, actually, looking through the terminals:\n\nLooking at the list, NT2 is 't2', NT5 is 't5', etc. Wait, looking at the bottom of the list:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\nNT30 \u2192 't4'\nNT30 \u2192 't3'?\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Wait, let me go through each terminal rule:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT2: 't5' \u2014 no, wait: NT2 \u2192 't5'? Let's see:\n\nIn the bottom of the grammar, under NT2, it says NT2 \u2192 't5'. Similarly, NT52 \u2192 't2', NT32 \u2192 't1', and so on.\n\nSo each non-terminal can either be a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo the start symbol S produces NT28 NT17. NT28 produces NT17 NT7, and NT17 produces NT1 NT58. Wait, but NT58 is another non-terminal. So S is expanding into a series of non-terminals.\n\nEach production step can be expanded until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. The problem is that the string is quite long, so I need to find a way to check whether it can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parse tree where each step corresponds to the grammar's productions. Alternatively, use the CYK algorithm, but since I might not know all the details, I can try a top-down approach.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first thing is that the string must start with t5 (from NT28) and t2 (from NT17). Let me confirm the terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal productions are all the ones where the RHS is a single terminal, like NT2 \u2192 't5', NT52 \u2192 't2', etc. So for example, NT2 is 't5', NT29 is 't5', NT5 is 't3'? Wait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, I think I need to list all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each rule, for example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2' (from NT4 \u2192 t2)\n\nNT5 \u2192 't3'? Because I see NT15 \u2192 't0', NT5 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, looking back, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t5\n\nNT5 \u2192 t3? Wait, looking at the list again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through the bottom part:\n\nAt the very end of the list, looking for NT* \u2192 't*':\n\nWait, no, the grammar is complicated, but the terminals are those that appear after the non-terminals. For example:\n\nLooking down, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT29 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT30 \u2192 't4' and 't3' \u2014 so NT30 can produce 't4' or 't3'.\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar is such that non-terminals can produce terminals or other non-terminals. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, for example, NT28 can be NT17 NT7, which are both non-terminals, so it's a two-step production.\n\nTo process the string, perhaps I can parse it using the grammar, ensuring each step follows the productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps it's feasible to manually parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is: t5 t0 t5 t2 t6 t3 t2 t6 t5 t6 t2 t0 t5 t3 t5 t2 t3 t1 t6 t6 t4 t4 t2 t4 t2 t5 t1 t1 t0 t4 t1 t4 t0 t1 t3 t2 t2 t6 t5 t3 t2 t4 t6 t5 t6 t5.\n\nSo, 39 tokens. Let's check the structure.\n\nThe first two tokens must be t5 and t0 because S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 \u2192 t2 or something else, but wait, let's see the actual production of NT28:\n\nLooking back, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. But NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, which in turn... Hmm, actually, maybe I should build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to represent the grammar as a set of allowed rules and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, note that the grammar is unambiguous, so there's only one way to parse the string correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser approach, but since it's a long string, maybe a more manual approach is feasible.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo first, NT28 must produce t2 and NT17 must produce t3. Wait, because NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, which ultimately produce t3 (since NT17 ends up being t5? Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me carefully trace the possible productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol is t5, then the second symbol is t0.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first symbol should be the first terminal of NT28, which is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. NT1 \u2192 't5', and NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT27. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the first few symbols:\n\nString starts with t5, t0, t5...\n\nWait, maybe another approach: list all the production rules starting from S and see how the string can be split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals, I can see which parts of the string must be generated by each rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree in a bracketed form.\n\nLet me try:\n\nThe first part is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first token must be the first symbol of NT28, which I now think is 't2' or ... Wait, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then NT1 \u2192 't5'. So the first token is t5.\n\nSecond token is t0. Hmm, this is the second symbol in the string, so t0 comes next.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map how the string can be split according to the grammar.\n\nLet me write down the tokens and see which symbols can appear at which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by checking if the string can be produced by the grammar step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using dynamic programming to identify which rules are applicable. But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps building a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to find an error in the string, indicating that it doesn't correspond to any part of the grammar.\n\nFor example, considering the string starts with t5, t0, t5... According to the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nSo the first two symbols must be the first terminal of NT28 followed by the first terminal of NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 or other rules, but in the main S rule, it's NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, NT28 is part of S's production, so NT28 can only produce certain things.\n\nWait, no, wait S \u2192 NT28 NT17 is a production; so S directly expands to NT28 and NT17.

{"custom_id":"request-674","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t1 t5 t1 t3 t1 t5 t1 t5 t1 t4 t3 t0 t1 t6 t3 t5 t3 t2 t3 t1 t0 t1 t0 t6 t3 t1 t6 t2 t1 t5 t5 t5 t1 t2 t2 t3 t3 t4 t2 t5 t5 t5 t3 t3 t2 t3`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all the production rules given here fit that form because each rule has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal when applicable.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, there are a lot of NT (non-terminal) productions. My goal is to see if this grammar can derive the given string, which is a sequence of terminals: t1, t5, t3, etc.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll need to trace back from the string to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Essentially, I should check if the string can be split into the rules defined in the grammar, working from the terminal symbols up to the start symbol S.\n\nBut before diving into the entire string, maybe I can check if the grammar includes some non-terminals that directly produce these ts, or if there are dependencies I need to consider. However, I notice that all non-terminals eventually produce a terminal, as per CNF. For example, NT17 \u2192 t3, NT54 \u2192 t3, and so on.\n\nThe string starts with 't1', which I should check against the productions to see if any NT can produce 't1'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24: Wait, these are non-terminals, so that won't directly produce t1. Hmm. Let me check which NTs directly produce 't1'. Scanning the rules, I notice:\n\nWait, actually, looking back, there's a rule: NT38 \u2192 t4, and also in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51\n- NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n- NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n- NT36 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44\n- NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT2\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24: Hmm, no direct t1.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41, which are non-terminals, but NT17 \u2192 t5, NT27 \u2192 t6, NT30 \u2192 t4, etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing an NT that directly produces 't1'. Wait, maybe I need to check all NT entries to see if any produce 't1'.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't1', according to the rules. All the NTs either produce terminals like t3, t5, t4, etc., or other non-terminals that eventually produce them. So, the only way to get 't1' is through some NT that produces it. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the rules, do any NT directly produce 't1'? Looking through each rule:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41: Non-terminal\n- NT2 \u2192 t5\n- NT27 \u2192 t6\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT7 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t3\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT10 \u2192 t2\n- NT11 \u2192 various NTs\n- NT12 \u2192 various NTs\n- NT13 \u2192 NT45 NT26\n- NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n- NT15 \u2192 t0\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT20 \u2192 t4\n- NT21 \u2192 t0\n- NT23 \u2192 various NTs\n- NT24 \u2192 t5\n- NT25 (Wait, not in the grammar provided)\n- And so on.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't1'. That seems strange. Let me make sure I haven't missed any. Looking through the rules again:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t5\n- Wait, no NT directly produces 't1'. So, how can the string start with 't1' if none of the NTs produce 't1' directly? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar or the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me check the grammar again. Oh wait, in the grammar, under NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Then, NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, and NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15. Then, NT45 \u2192 NT7 NT43, and so on. But none of these produce 't1' directly. Hmm. So this is confusing because the first symbol is 't1', but according to the grammar provided, there are no NTs that produce 't1'.\n\nWait, did I misread the grammar? Let me check again for any NTs that produce 't1'. Let me go through the rules one by one:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\nNT2 \u2192 t5\nNT27 \u2192 t6\nNT3 \u2192 t3\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\nNT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\nNT6 \u2192 t4\nNT7 \u2192 t5\nNT8 \u2192 t3\nNT9 \u2192 t3\nNT10 \u2192 t2\nNT11 \u2192 various NTs\n...\nWait, no NT directly produces 't1'. So the string starts with 't1', but since no NT in the grammar can produce 't1', this suggests that the string can't be generated by the grammar, which would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut before I conclude, perhaps I should check if any production leads to 't1' after several steps. Maybe after expanding, some NTs can produce 't1' indirectly. Let me see.\n\nLooking again, all Non-terminals expand to other Non-terminals or Terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 t5, which is a terminal. So, no NT can produce 't1'.\n\nTherefore, since the grammar cannot produce 't1' as a terminal, the string starting with 't1' cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nHowever, wait a moment. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT28, as per the first rule? Wait, no, the first rule is S \u2192 NT28 NT28? Or wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the first production is S -> NT28 NT28? No, looking at the given grammar:\n\nHere's the first line: S -> NT28 NT28? Wait, no, the very first line after the grammar header is S -> NT28 NT28? Let me recheck.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me look at the grammar:\n\n\"Here is the context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar. Your job is to determine whether or not the grammar generates the provided string. You can use any reasoning strategy you like, but you must end your response with either 'Yes' or 'No.'\n\nGrammar: ```S -> NT28 NT28\nNT57 -> NT13 NT47\nNT30 -> NT44 NT13\n...\nOther rules...```\n\nWait, so the start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT28. But earlier, I saw NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, NT28 produces NT17 and 't7'. But from previous observations, I don't see any NT producing 't1'. So, any string generated by S would have to start with NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, but since NT17 \u2192 t5 and NT7 \u2192 t5, the first part would produce t5 t5, not 't1'.\n\nTherefore, the string starting with 't1' would not be generated, since none of the Non-terminals can produce 't1' as a terminal symbol at any step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some NT that indirectly produces 't1'. Let me check NT1 again. NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Then, NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15, and NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15. Then, NT45 \u2192 NT7 NT43.

The string is a sequence of tokens: t0, t3, t5, t6, and so on. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I should note that some of the production rules end with a terminal symbol, meaning those are the terminal productions. For example, NT17 -> 't3' is a terminal production. These terminals are going to correspond to the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S -> NT28 NT17. So the initial derivation starts with NT28 and NT17. Then, each of these can be expanded further until all the symbols are terminals.\n\nI should try to see if I can parse the string by working backwards. Each terminal in the string represents a step in the production. So I need to build a parse tree where each node is an NT and the leaves are the terminals. \n\nLet me list the string again: t0, t3, t5, t6, ..., up to t6 t6 t4 t4 ... and ends with t5 t0. Wait, maybe the easiest way is to see if each token in the string can be built from the NT symbols in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, the grammar has several NT symbols, each with their own productions.

Looking at the NT productions, I see NT58 -> 't1' and 't5'; NT9 -> 't3' and 't2'; NT29 -> 't5' and 't6' (if I'm not mistaken). Wait, looking at NT58, it has productions like NT58 -> NT1 and NT46, but wait no, in the grammar, NT58 -> NT1 NT46. Wait, but maybe some other NTs have terminal.

So NT17 can produce t5. Similarly:\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\n- NT17: 't5' as a terminal.\n- NT27: No terminal in its direct rules.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is a sequence of tokens: `t4 t5 t3 t2 t0 t6 t3 t5 t3 t6 t4 t2 t5 t6 t4 t3 t0 t2 t5 t1 t1 t4 t4 t3 t2 t5 t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t2 t3 t1 t0 t5 t2 t3 t5 t0 t5 t2 t2 t6 t5 t5 t2`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG. It looks like it's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which first produces NT28 NT17, according to the grammar. The terminals are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, and some non-terminals like NT2, NT3, etc.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find matches in the grammar. If the entire string can be processed, then the answer is Yes; otherwise, No.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. The string starts with `t4 t5 ...`. Looking at the grammar, I see that S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, each of these non-terminals must be expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nI'll need to figure out what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nFor NT28:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- Also, NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33 (Wait, no, checking again: Looking at the list, actually NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33 isn't there. Wait, let me double-check the provided grammar.)\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, so let me scan through. I see NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and also looking at further down, I see NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33? Or is there another rule? Wait, looking again: under NT28, it says NT28 -> NT17 NT7, then later I see NT28 -> NT7 NT33? Or maybe it's another production. Hmm, perhaps the user made a typo, but I think the key is that each production only has two non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I see that NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 is listed, and also elsewhere, for example, NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43 is a production, but I need to see all rules for NT28.\n\nWait, let me make a list of all NT28 productions as provided:\n\nLooking through the full grammar provided:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (line 58)\n- No, checking further: line 93, NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT33? Or is that maybe misread. Wait, the entire grammar is quite long. Let me make sure I get all the NT28 rules correctly.\n\nWait, the user's grammar list includes:\n\nLine 58: NT28 -> NT17 NT7\nThen, later line 79: NT28 -> NT7 NT33? Or is that a mistake? Wait, line numbers may not be accurate, but in the provided list, the user mentions NT28 is produced as NT17 NT7 and also NT7 NT33? Or perhaps I've misread.\n\nWait, actually going through the grammar list:\n\nLooking through each line, I see NT28 is only once: line 58 (user's numbering) is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So that's the only production for NT28.\n\nSo NT28 can only go to NT17 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 (line 82). Wait, looking back: The grammar for NT17: line 89 (user's index 89) is NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nThen, checking NT1's productions: line 106 (user's) is NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. So NT1 can go to NT58 NT41.\n\nNow, starting from S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Then, NT7 can produce different things.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: There are two:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 (line 7: User line 7)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30 (line 14)\n\nSo NT7 can go to either NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30.\n\nLet's pick one of these to see if we can process the string.\n\nGiven the string starts with t4 t5 t3 t2 t0... Let's see.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion from S is NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 expands to NT17 NT7. So S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, let me correct that. S's first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So when expanding S, it becomes NT28 NT17. Then, each of these NTs is replaced until terminals are reached.\n\nSo for the string, the first token is t4. Let's see how that can happen.\n\nLooking at the string: first token is t4.\n\nWhich non-terminals can produce t4? Let's check all the productions ending with t4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces t4 except possibly from a non-terminal expanding to it. Alternatively, maybe it comes from a production like NT24 \u2192 NT43 NT47 (line 87) or other similar rules.\n\nWait, let's check all possible productions where a non-terminal expands to t4. Let's go through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10 (line 90). No t4.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 (line 95), no t4.\n- NT54 \u2192 NT14 NT11 (line 105). No.\n- NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30 (line 111). No.\n- NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43 (line 113). No.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT41 (line 125). No.\n- Other NTs: I don't see any direct productions to t4. Maybe t4 is produced from some NT via indirect expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, I should look for all NTs that have a production leading to a terminal like t4.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36. So if either of these have rules leading to t4, but I don't see that.\n- NT5 has NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT26, and so on. Maybe not.\n- NT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10 (line 130). No t4.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 (line 82). No t4.\nWait, maybe t4 is produced through NT7?\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 (line 7) and NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30.\n\nWait, NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10 (line 90). So when NT7 expands to NT2 NT19, and then NT2 must produce something ending with t4.\n\nLooking at NT2's productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10 (line 90)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2 (line ...? Probably not relevant)\n- Let me check NT2's productions.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10 (line 90)\n- Are there any other productions for NT2? For example, line 137: NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, but that's for NT23. No, line 90 is the only one.\n\nSo, NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10, which are both non-terminals. Then NT54 may produce something.\n\nLooking at NT54's productions:\n\n- NT54 \u2192 NT52 NT35 (line 104)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT29 NT54 (line 111)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33 (line 119)\n- Also, NT54 \u2192 NT23 NT28 (line 115) and perhaps others.\n\nLooking further, NT54 expands into other non-terminals.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe it's better to see if the string starts with t4. Let's see, perhaps the string can't start with t4 because the initial productions don't produce t4 directly.\n\nWait, the string's first token is t4, so let's trace back"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nThe grammar provided has several non-terminals like S, NT57, NT30, etc., and the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending with 't's which I think are terminals. My task is to figure out if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar and the string carefully. The string starts with 't1' and ends with a bunch of 't's, so it's a series of terminal symbols. My approach is to simulate how the grammar could generate this string.\n\nLooking at the top-level rule: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, any string generated by the grammar should start with NT28 and NT17. That means the first two symbols after a start S should be the results of these NT28 and NT17 productions.\n\nBut the string starts with 't1 t0...'. So, maybe the production for NT28 and NT17 are not directly 't's. Let's check the productions for NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, the productions in the grammar are all in CNF, so each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, actually, looking closely, some productions like NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26 are two non-terminals. Others like NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. So each production is two non-terminals, not a mix of terminals and non-terminals. But wait, some symbols like 't1', 't0', etc., are terminals?\n\nWait, wait, in the context-free grammar, non-terminals cannot produce terminals directly unless they're explicitly defined that way. So if the grammar only has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, then a would be a terminal. But looking through the rules, none of the non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols except for when the right-hand side is a terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I don't see any production where a terminal (t0, t1, etc.) is on the right side except perhaps in the very last productions.\n\nWait, no, let's check the rules again. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT17 NT7, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, etc. I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So that's confusing because the string has 't1', 't0' etc., which are terminals. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar with NT54 \u2192 't3', which is a production that a non-terminal NT54 transforms into the terminal 't3'. So in that case, NT54 is an explicit terminal producing rule. Similarly, NT4 \u2192 't2', NT36 \u2192 't4', NT29 \u2192 't5', and so on.\n\nSo, the top-level rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nLet's look at the rules for NT28 and NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So to generate NT28, we need NT17 and NT7. Then, NT17 --> 't5'. So the terminal 't5' is from NT17. NT7 has several productions, like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, etc. None of these produce terminals directly except when the non-terminals eventually derive to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT35 \u2192 't1', NT33 \u2192 't3', NT26 \u2192 't2', and others.\n\nSo, for the purposes of the parser, the start is S, which produces NT28 and NT17. The NT17 can directly produce 't5', which is one of the terminals in the string (the second 't5' is in position 10 or so).\n\nNow, let's see. The string starts with 't1', but according to the S rule, the first symbol comes from NT28, which is derived as NT17 and NT7. NT17 is a single terminal 't5', but the string starts with 't1', which is different.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, the initial rule is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so when we apply this, NT28 can only contribute symbols after NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure this as a parse tree. The string is a series of terminals, so the parse tree should consist of symbols that reduce to these terminals.\n\nLet me consider each token in the string and see if a derivation path exists through the grammar that leads to it.\n\nWe'll proceed step by step, each token needs to be formed through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a pushdown automaton, but that's more complicated.\n\nAnother approach is to see for each token whether there's a way it can be produced by some non-terminal following the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt1, t0, t2, t5, t1, t3, t2, t0, t0, t3, t1, t1, t4, t6, t4, t5, t2, t6, t5, t3, t4, t6, t4, t0, t3, t6, t2, t5, t1, t5, t2, t3, t3, t6, t3, t5, t2, t2, t0, t3, t1, t4, t0, t4, t6, t2, t4, t4.\n\nThat's a long string; I need to find a way to parse it.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation should expand exactly two non-terminals into one.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. It's also possible that each production has exactly two symbols on the right. Wait, no, for two-terminals, but each production can have just a single terminal, but only for unit rules. Wait, but in CNF, all productions are two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. If a production is A \u2192 B, that's allowed, but if A \u2192 a, that's also allowed because it's a single terminal. Or wait, Chomsky Normal Form specifically allows A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So in practice, each production in Chomsky Normal Form is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, but in some cases, it's allowed to have A \u2192 a, which is a single terminal as the production. So that would mean that the non-terminal can directly produce a terminal symbol.\n\nTherefore, in our case, some of the non-terminals have productions to terminals, like NT54 \u2192 't3', NT5 \u2192 't0', etc.\n\nSo, the string is made of terminals, which suggests that some of the non-terminals in the grammar must directly produce these terminals.\n\nLet me check the grammar to see which non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules, several have 't' as the right-hand side. For example:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT254 (Wait, let me look again):\n\nIn the given grammar:\n\nNT54 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't0'\n\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT48 \u2192 't1'\n\netc.\n\nSo, these non-terminals produce terminal symbols when expanding.\n\nBut to get a string starting with 't1' and the grammar's starting symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which is S = NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, NT28 produces NT17 and NT7. Since S is formed by NT28 and NT17, expanding them would generate symbols in the derived string.\n\nBut the string starts with 't1' at the beginning, but according to the rules, NT28's first production goes to NT17 and NT7. NT17 is 't5', which would be the first symbol in the string (if that's how the derivation works). But here, the string starts with 't1', which doesn't match 't5'.\n\nWait wait, maybe I confused NT28 and NT17 in the expansion order. Let me double-check the initial rule: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the order of expansion would first produce NT28 and NT17 as the first two symbols.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So for S to produce, we take NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28's first production is NT17 NT7. So when we apply S \u2192 NT28 NT17, this becomes NT28 NT17.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.

{"custom_id":"request-692","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice a rule that produces 't'. The rules that generate terminals are:\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so S can become a sequence of other non-terminals leading to terminals.\n- There are many rules that end with 't3', 't5', etc., and some are directly replaced by 't4', 't5', 't2', etc. For example, NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15, and some NT rules produce terminal symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t0 t5 t0 t4 t6 t3 t4 t5 t6 t6 t6 t0 t6 t4 t5 t3 t0 t3 t4 t4 t2 t6 t0 t3 t4 t0 t1 t6 t3 t4 t1 t5 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t5 t6 t0 t4 t5 t2 t1 t1`.\n\nI see that all elements are 't's followed by numbers, which match the grammar's terminal symbols. So, it's possible that this string is generated.\n\nNext, I should analyze the structure of the grammar. It defines various non-terminals that break down into other non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through the given rules.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols. The string has 52 elements, which means there are 26 productions needed to reach the terminals. However, since the grammar might have branching, the actual number of steps could be more.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parsing problem, trying to match the grammar rules from the start and see if the entire string fits.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the first two symbols should be the terminal parts of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28 rules:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nSo, NT28 expands into two non-terminals. Each of these will need to expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nThis suggests that the string starts with t4, as the terminals are 't4', 't0', etc., but I need to track how the non-terminals expand into the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for sequences of terminals that can form the given string. However, since this is a CNF grammar, it might be recursive, which makes it hard to directly map the string.\n\nAnother approach is to simulate the parse using the grammar. However, manually doing this for a 52-symbol string is time-consuming, so I need to find shortcuts.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have circular definitions. For example:\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44 and NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14, and NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5, which loops back to NT53 and NT5, which in turn have connections to other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the smallest grammars that could produce the string. For example, the start symbol S is NT28 NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28:\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nSo, S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nThen, each NT17 has a rule NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nSo, NT17 becomes NT1 NT58, so S would be NT1 NT58 NT7 NT1 NT58.\n\nEach of these non-terminals (NT1, NT58, NT7) has their own expansion.\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41.\n\nSo, NT1 becomes NT58 NT41.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11.\n\nNT27 has two rules:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 \u2192 leads to recursion\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3.\n\nLet's pick the second option, NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3.\n\nSo, NT58 becomes NT27 NT11 \u2192 (NT4 NT3) NT11.\n\nNT11 has multiple rules, for example, NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46 or NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT43.\n\nI need to choose which path to take. Since the string starts with 't4', let's see if any of the terminals can start with 't4'.\n\nLooking at the NT rules, NT36 \u2192 't4', but in the string, the first symbol is 't4'. So, perhaps one of the NT's expands to 't4'.\n\nWait, but NT36 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. The terminals are defined as individual tokens like 't4', 't0', etc.\n\nSo, to get 't4' as a terminal, we need a non-terminal that directly produces 't4'.\n\nLooking at the NT rules:\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9, which then may produce 't5' or others\n- NT39 \u2192 't35', but 't35' is a non-terminal that eventually produces terminals, perhaps 't5' or others.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in the grammar, the non-terminals are all the NTx where x is a number, and some of them are eventually replaced by terminals (e.g., NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15, which may eventually become 't2'). However, the rules that directly produce terminals are like NT52 \u2192 't2', NT32 \u2192 't1', etc.\n\nSo for the string, each element like 't4 t0' must come from a production that either directly ends in a terminal or through a chain.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be parsed by recursively applying the grammar rules.\n\nGiven that manually simulating this is too time-consuming, perhaps a better approach is to look for the structure of the string in terms of the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is 52 elements long, and each production contributes two symbols, starting from S, which is two symbols, the parse tree would have depth 26, but since the grammar is recursive, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the string must be a sequence of terminals that can be derived from the start symbol S via the grammar. So, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, another approach is to use a recursive descent parser approach, but since I'm doing this manually, I can try to track possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t4 t0 t5 t0 t4 t6 t3 t4 t5 t6 t6 t6 t0 t6 t4 t5 t3 t0 t3 t4 t4 t2 t6 t0 t3 t4 t0 t1 t6 t3 t4 t1 t5 t4 t2 t4 t4 t1 t4 t1 t5 t6 t0 t4 t5 t2 t1 t1`.\n\nThe first symbol is 't4'. Let's see which non-terminals produce 't4' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT14 \u2192 't5' (from NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5, and NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56, but that's too deep)\n- NT51 \u2192 't5' (NT51 \u2192 NT1 NT15)\n- NT4 \u2192 't2' (from NT45 \u2192 NT56 NT33, but that's too deep)\nWait, perhaps none of the NT's directly produce 't4' as a terminal. Wait, looking back, in the grammar rules for NT4:\n- NT4 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n- NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n- NT53 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2\n- NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT35\n- NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n- NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n- NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n- NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n\nThis seems to loop indefinitely without producing a terminal. Hmm, perhaps my understanding is incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back, in the grammar rules:\n- Some NT rules directly produce terminals, like NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, but do any of the NT rules produce 't4' directly?\n\nLooking through the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems all the rules are either converting non-terminals into two other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and then NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, etc.\n\nThe string starts with `t0`, which suggests that one of the production rules ends with t, and since all the rules ending with t seem to correspond to specific non-terminals. For example, NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43 can lead to t3 (since NT7 \u2192 't3' on some cases), and NT4 \u2192 't2', NT0 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nThe first thing I should do is map each `tX` to the corresponding non-terminal that produces it directly. Looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT9 \u2192 t3\n- NT0 \u2192 t5\n- NT52 \u2192 t2 (since NT52 \u2192 't2')\n- NT3 \u2192 t3\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (since it's a production to 't5')\nWait, no. Actually, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals.

Let's list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions:\n\nLooking for rules where the right-hand side (RHS) is a terminal, without any non-terminals. But in CNF, a production can't have terminals on the LHS. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So any production in the grammar that has a terminal on the RHS is allowed in CNF.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules provided, the terminals are all the 't*' strings. So any NT rule ending in 'tX' is a production that directly produces a terminal.\n\nLet's compile all the NT \u2192 a rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT28 \u2192 't1'\n- NT14 \u2192 't4'\n- NT40 \u2192 't4' (from NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21, but that's a non-terminal rule. Wait no, in the grammar, do any NT rules directly produce terminals?\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood. The grammar provided is a set of rules where each rule is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So any rule where RHS is a single terminal is a direct production to that terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51 \u2192 not a terminal\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23 \u2192 not\n- Looking for any rule where RHS is just one terminal.\n\nWait, I might have missed some. Let's go through each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 no terminal here.\n- NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47 \u2192 no.\n- NT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13 \u2192 no.\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21 \u2192 no.\n- NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26 \u2192 no.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 \u2192 no.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30 \u2192 no.\n- NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14 \u2192 no.\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 \u2192 no.\n- NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26 \u2192 no.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48 \u2192 no.\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 \u2192 no.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 \u2192 no.\n- NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9 \u2192 no. Wait, 't3' and 't4'? Hmm.\nNo, that's NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9, which are non-terminals.\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3 \u2192 which are non-terminals.\n- NT44 \u2192 NT30 NT8 \u2192 NT30 and NT8 are non-terminals.\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' \u2192 this is a direct terminal production.\nWait, yes, looking here: looking at the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't5' on two lines, but actually, it's the same rule. So NT17 directly produces 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, let's check all rules to find any direct terminals:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, looking through all the rules:\n\nHere are the direct terminal productions (where RHS is a single terminal):\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, is that all? Let me check every rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT17: no\n- NT57 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT30 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT40 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT48 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT7 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT7 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT44 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT28 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT48 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT7 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT5 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT27 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT57 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT27 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT44 \u2192 ...: no\n- NT17 \u2192 't5': yes\n- NT9 \u2192 't3': yes (Wait, looking at the grammar rules, I see 'NT9 \u2192 't3''. So yes, NT9 directly produces 't3'.\n- NT52 \u2192 't2': yes.\n- NT4 \u2192 't2': yes.\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't2' (from S? No, looking again).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is:\n\nThe string starts with t0, so I think the start symbol is S. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and so on.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only NT rules that directly produce terminals are NT9 \u2192 t3, NT4 \u2192 t2, NT52 \u2192 t2, and NT17 \u2192 t5.\n\nWait, but I also see NT29 \u2192 t5, is that correct? Let me go through all the rules again:\n\nLooking for RHS that is a single terminal:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 ...: non-terminals.\n- NT30 \u2192 ...: non-terminals.\n- NT30 \u2192 't4' on some rules? No, wait, NT30 is defined as NT44 NT13 on some rules, but I'm looking for rules where the RHS is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for any rule where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT30 \u2192 't4': no, the rule for NT30 is either NT44 NT13 or NT30 \u2192 't4'? No, looking again.\n\nWait, I think I was wrong earlier. Let me list all the rules and identify which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (yes)\n- NT9 \u2192 't3' (yes, because in the last section, it's written \"NT9 -> t3\")\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (looking through the rules, I see \"NT52 -> 't2'\" in the grammar)\n- NT4 \u2192 't2' (I see \"NT4 -> 't2'\" in the grammar)\n- Wait, let's double-check all the rules:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the rules for terminals are:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n\nAre there more? Let me scan through all the rules again.\n\nLooking back at the list, I see:\n\n- \"NT52 -> 't2' (from NT52 -> 't2'; another rule from NT52 may exist, but likely 't2' is only from that)\n- NT4 -> 't2' (looking for any rule where NT4 \u2192 't2')\n\nSo, yes, NT4 \u2192 't2', NT52 \u2192 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-702","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string starts with 't5' and ends with 't5', which are terminals. \n\nLooking at the productions, most of the non-terminals seem to have fixed transformations into other non-terminals. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, so S will generate two NTs, each of which will further break down into other NTs until we reach terminal symbols which represent 't0' to 't6'.\n\nThe string given has a sequence of 102 tokens, all of which are either t0-t6. My first thought is to see if these tokens can be generated by the grammar's productions. \n\nLet me consider the number of symbols. The string length is 102, which is 3*34, but since starting with S which is two symbols, the parse tree depth should be such that the number of symbols is 2*3^k -1. Wait, that's the formula for the maximum number of symbols in a derivation of height k. For the given string, 102 is not equal to 2*3^k -1 for any integer k, so perhaps it's impossible because the grammar produces strings whose count is specific. \n\nWait, more accurately, the number of symbols (including both NTs and terminals) in the string must match what's possible. Starting from S, the initial expansion is two NTs. Each NT can expand into two more NTs or a terminal. So the total number of symbols at each step increases by one (since each production of two NTs and one terminal is a way to count terms). Wait, no, in CNF, each production has either one terminal or two NTs. So each step in the expansion adds one more symbol because each NT can produce either two NTs (expanding the count by 1, since replacing one with two) or a terminal (leaving the count the same). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider the total number of symbols. The initial S is one node, which can be expanded into two NTs. Each NT can either produce two NTs or a terminal. So the total number of terminals (t) minus 1 equals the number of NTs, which equals the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, the number of leaves in the parse tree is the number of terminals in the string. Let me recall the formula: for a context-free grammar, the number of strings generated has a number of terminals equal to (n-1) where n is the number of non-terminals in the derivation. But I'm not sure if that applies here. \n\nAlternatively, considering the start symbol S. Each production starts with S as NT28 NT17, which are both non-terminals. Each of these can be replaced with other NTs or terminals. The number of terminal symbols in the string must equal the number of times each NT can produce a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to notice that the grammar seems to be designed in such a way that each production eventually leads to a fixed set of terminals. For example, NT4 -> NT5 NT36, with NT5 possibly leading to 't2', and NT36 to 't4', so NT4 generates t2 t4.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each NT seems to be producing other NTs until they reach a terminal. So for example, S -> NT28 NT17, which then breaks down through a chain of productions into terminals. So the entire string should be a combination of all the terminals produced from these paths.\n\nThe problem is to see if the given string can be generated by all these paths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar has certain terminals that must appear in a specific count or order.\n\nWait, let's think about how the grammar allows for terminals. Each production that ends with a terminal stops the expansion for that NT. So for example, NT3 -> NT19 NT55, but both NT19 and NT55 can expand further until they reach terminals.\n\nBut given that the grammar is fixed, perhaps we can think about what terminal sequences are possible.\n\nWait, but looking at the string given:\n\nIt starts with t5, then t4, t6, t4, t4, t3, t3, t3, t2, t2, t3, t6, t4, t0, etc. This seems quite arbitrary, but maybe it's better to test if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the grammar's steps.\n\nLet me check the start symbol S: S -> NT28 NT17. So the initial two NTs are NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7. Then NT7 can be NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30 or others. Wait, let's see. NT28: the production is NT17 NT7. NT17 is a terminal (as per the final rule, NT17 -> 't5'), but wait, looking at the grammar, wait, in the provided rules, I see some lines like NT17 -> 't5', yes, because in the list of NTs, there's NT17 -> 't5'. So when NT17 is expanded, it becomes 't5'.\n\nSo, for NT28: it's NT17 NT7 -> 't5' and then NT7. So the first symbols will be 't5' and then whatever comes from NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 is the second element, which is expanded as 't5'.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be t5 and t5 or something else? Wait no: wait, NT28's production is NT17 NT7, so when S is generated, it's the concatenation of the expansions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, S -> NT28 NT17, so the string is expansion of NT28 followed by expansion of NT17.\n\nBut NT17 is \"t5\", so the second symbol in the string is 't5'. Wait, in the given string, the second symbol is 't4', not 't5', which is a problem. So the first two symbols in the string are t5 t4. But according to the S's production, the first NT is NT28, which when expanded is NT17 NT7. Then the second NT is NT17, which is 't5'.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be 't5' followed by whatever NT7 produces. But the string starts with 't5' followed by 't4'. That means that the expansion of NT28's first component (which is NT17) must produce 't4', but according to the rules, NT17 -> 't5' only. NT17 is a terminal, so it cannot produce any other thing than 't5'. Therefore, the first two symbols must be 't5' followed by something else, but the given string starts with 't5 t4', which is impossible because NT17 in S's production cannot expand to 't4'\u2014it can only produce 't5'.\n\nTherefore, the entire string cannot be generated by this grammar because the second symbol in the string is 't4', but according to the grammar, after 't5' (from NT17), the next symbol must come from NT7, which may or may not produce 't4'. Wait, no\u2014actually, the entire string is generated by the two NTs, so NT28 and NT17. \n\nSo the full string would start with whatever comes from NT28 followed by whatever comes from NT17 (which is 't5'). \n\nGiven that the first NT is NT28: NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo the expansion of NT28 starts with NT17 and then NT7. Both are NTs. \n\nNT17 is a terminal 't5', so the first symbol is 't5'. NT7 then expands. Let's see the production of NT7: it has multiple options, like:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19,\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30,\n\nNT7 -> NT44 NT13,\n\nand others. So, NT7 can expand into a series of NTs that eventually produce terminals.\n\nLet's trace what comes from NT7:\n\nSuppose NT7 expands via NT2 NT19. NT2 is 't5' (since NT2 -> 't5'), and NT19 -> 't3' as per the rules. So the first two symbols after NT17 would be 't5 t3', making the entire start 't5 t5 t3...'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT7 expands via NT13 NT30. NT13 can expand. Looking at NT13's rules:\n\nNT13 -> NT1 NT7,\n\nNT13 -> NT45 NT26,\n\nalso other options. Wait, NT13 can produce NT1 or NT45.\n\nLet me pick one path. For instance, suppose NT13 expands into NT1 and NT7. Then NT1 would have a rule NT1 -> NT58 NT41.

The strings generated by such a grammar can be checked using a method that tracks the possible non-terminals and the current expansion steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the terminals are t0 to t5, and the non-terminals are labeled from N1 to N58. The target string consists only of terminals, so each token in the string must correspond to a production that eventually reduces to a terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. So, the expansion of the start symbol S is a binary tree where each node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nTo analyze the string, I can simulate a pushdown parser approach, tracking the possible non-terminals at each step. Each token in the string represents a step where a non-terminal must expand into two non-terminals that can further expand to the next tokens.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, after the first token 't1', I need to see if S can generate this via some expansion. Wait, actually, the first token after S would be one of its productions. Since S \u2192 NT28 NT17, each production of NT28 and NT17 must generate the subsequent tokens.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take a step-by-step approach.\n\nThe string starts with 't1'. So, the first step is to see if NT28 or NT17 can produce 't1'. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and another NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58. Neither directly produce t1. Wait, looking deeper, NT58 has productions NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15 and NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT41. Wait, wait, let me check each rule for terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the productions where non-terminals directly produce terminals. From the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\nNT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58\nWait, I'm not seeing any direct productions where NT17 \u2192 t1 or t0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the parsing approach.\n\nWait, the string is `t1 t0 t2 t6...`. Let me list all the terminals and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT17 can produce 't5' via NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT5; wait, no, checking NT17's productions:\n\nWait, I see NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58; both of these are non-terminals. There's also NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT6? Wait, no, looking back, NT17 has:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT17's rules:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58, and perhaps other rules? Wait, let me check again. From the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT17 \u2192 t{something}...\n\nI see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58\n- NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nBut in the provided grammar, there's also NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT6? No, looking through:\n\nWait, let's look for all NT17 productions:\n\nThe lines including NT17 are:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 -> NT58 NT58\n\nIs there any NT17 \u2192 NT55 NT6? No, the lines are:\n\n- NT17 -> NT58 NT55 (Wait, no, checking again:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the relevant lines are:\n\nLines with NT17:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 -> NT58 NT58\n\nNo, the user provided a long list. So, actually, I think the productions for NT17 are:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58\n\nAre there any direct terminals? It doesn't look like it. So, perhaps NT17 can't directly produce 't1' or 't0'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't1', which suggests that either S or one of its non-terminals must directly produce 't1', which isn't the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the productions. Let me check again for NT57:\n\nWait, no, looking through:\n\nI think I might have mislooked. Let me search the production rules for NT17:\n\nFrom the user's list:\n\n- NT17 is defined as:\n  \u2192 NT1 NT58\n  \u2192 NT58 NT58\n\nWait, so that's it. So NT17 doesn't directly go to any terminal. So that means the first expansion must come from S, which is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, the first token is t1, which would have to come from NT28 or NT17. But neither directly produce 't1'. So perhaps the problem is that NT28 or NT17 can eventually produce 't1' through a series of derivations.\n\nWait, no, in the context of the expansion, each step adds two non-terminals. Wait, I think I need to model this correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should start by checking if the entire string can be built by starting from S and expanding step by step, matching each terminal in the string in order.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and each production is applied in the order of the resulting string. So, each terminal in the string must be the result of a chain of derivations starting from S.\n\nBut since the string starts with 't1', we need to find a production sequence that can get us to 't1' as the first terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start by checking all possible non-terminals that can directly produce the first token t1. If there are none, then the string is invalid.\n\nSo, first token is t1. Looking for NTs that have a production NT \u2192 T{1}. Let's scan the productions for any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't1'.\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\n- N3: NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n- N6: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT4\n- N11: NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46, etc.\n- N27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT41\n- N39: NT39 \u2192 NT13 NT35, etc.\n- N40: NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n- N44: NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n- N48: NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n- N52: NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36\n- N54: NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33\n- N57: NT57 \u2192 NT12 NT36\n- N53: NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23\n- N41: NT41 \u2192 NT45 NT15\n- N12: NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n- N19: NT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\n- N26: NT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n- N32: NT32 \u2192 NT52 NT1\n- N54: NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly produces 't1'. 't1' corresponds to the string '1' which is in the token 't1'. \n\nWait, let's look at all the terminals that non-terminals produce:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT58. No terminals, so no 't1' or 't0' here.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n- NT51 \u2192 NT1 NT15\n- NT39 \u2192 NT13 NT35, etc.\n- Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe there's a non-terminal that directly produces 't1'.

{"custom_id":"request-713","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure, with productions either combining two non-terminals or ending in terminals like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of symbols: `t0 t1 t3 t1 t6 t3 t0 t5 t2 t3 t5 t4 t0 t5 t1 t2 t4 t5 t5 t5 t4 t0 t3 t1 t4 t6 t3 t4 t1 t2 t3 t5 t2 t5 t3 t0 t1 t3 t4 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t1 t2 t1 t5 t5 t4`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. The best way to approach this is through a parsing method, perhaps using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent. But since I'm doing this manually, a top-down parsing might be feasible.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the first part of the string should start with NT28 followed by NT17, or something that leads to that.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t0. Wait, but S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first part should be NT28. What does NT28 produce? Let's check the grammar. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Okay, so the first part is now NT17 followed by NT7.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol after t0 is t1. Wait, how does NT17 produce something starting with t1? Let me check NT17's productions. Looking through the grammar, I see NT17 has two rules: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and NT17 \u2192 NT2 NT19. Hmm, the terminals are 't's, but NT17 seems to produce combinations of other non-terminals, not terminals. That means that unless one of those non-terminals leads directly to a terminal, the initial step might not produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm focusing too much on NT28. Maybe I should look for a production that starts with a terminal. For example, looking for a production where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal. For instance, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, but that's still non-terminals. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11. No. Then NT17 \u2192 't5' according to the grammar? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the last part has lines like NT54 \u2192 't3', NT29 \u2192 't5', NT30 \u2192 't4' or 't3', NT20 \u2192 't4' or 't3', etc. So some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT30 \u2192 't4' or 't3', and NT20 \u2192 't4' or 't3'. So maybe these non-terminals can produce the initial terminals.\n\nWait, the start symbol S produces NT28 NT17, so the first production requires that both NT28 and NT17 lead to the beginning of the string. So, if either NT28 or NT17 can start with a terminal, that's a path. Or perhaps their sub-productions can.\n\nLet's check NT28. According to the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 produces two more non-terminals: NT17 and NT7. Similarly, NT17 has the options NT1 NT58 or NT2 NT19.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to terminal sequences from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive descent approach would help. Each non-terminal corresponds to a function that generates its string. For example, if a non-terminal can only produce terminals, it can be directly represented in the string. Otherwise, it can be expanded into two non-terminals.\n\nLet me try to look for parts of the string that might match the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t0. So, is there a production that directly produces t0? Let's see the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT that directly go to t0. I see NT0 \u2192 't5'?

{"custom_id":"request-40","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t5 t5 t2 t3 t5` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar is in CNF, which is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But wait, I'm not sure if I need to use CYK here. Maybe another approach would be to try to derive the string or see if the grammar can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals have productions that can lead to terminal strings like 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5'. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, and looking at NT28's productions, it eventually reduces to 't4', and NT17 reduces to 't5'. So S can derive 't4 t5' directly. But our string is longer than that, so there must be more steps.\n\nThe string `t5 t5 t2 t3 t5` has five symbols. Let me think about how the grammar can generate this. Each step in the derivation should split into two parts based on the CNF productions.\n\nLet me start from the top symbol S:\n\nS can split into NT28 and NT17. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Now, each of these can further split. Let's look at NT28 and NT17's productions.\n\nNT28 can produce NT17 and NT7, so maybe one path is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. But wait, looking at NT17, it reduces to 't5'. So that gives us 't5' so far.\n\nBut then NT7 can split into multiple options. Looking at NT7's productions, it can turn into NT4 NT19, NT2 NT19, or NT4 NT48, etc. Hmm, this could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different path. Let's see, the string starts with two 't5's. So maybe the first NT28 reduces to something that gives the first 't5', and the NT17 gives the second 't5'.\n\nWait, looking at S \u2192 NT28 NT17, if NT28 produces something that starts with 't5' and NT17 also produces 't5', that might work. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 | NT7 | NT44 NT13 | ... etc. Hmm, I see NT28 can go to NT17 NT7. If NT17 is 't5' that's good, but then NT7 needs to produce the next symbols. Alternatively, maybe NT28 can go to NT7, which is 't5' after some steps.\n\nWait, this seems confusing. Maybe I should consider the CYK algorithm approach. Let me try that.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell [i,j] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position i to j in the string. The string is `t5 t5 t2 t3 t5`, so let's index it from 0 to 4.\n\nFirst, we'll check each single character and find which non-terminals can produce them. Then, we'll build up for the entire string.\n\nFor single characters:\n- 't5' can be produced by NT54, NT58, NT19, NT28, NT51, NT57, etc., based on the given productions. There's also NT5 from the grammar because looking back, the grammar has NT5 -> NT43 NT24, and from NT43, but wait, in the given grammar, NT5's productions aren't listed until much later. Wait, looking at the grammar, I think I might have misread it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I don't see a rule for NT5 -> 't5'. Instead, it seems that NT5 reduces to other non-terminals, and eventually, these reduce to 't's like t0, t1, etc. So perhaps I can look at each 't' and find the possible non-terminals that can derive them.\n\nStarting with 't5', I see production rules that have 't5' as a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see NT52 -> 't5', NT53 -> 't5', NT57 -> 't5', NT58 -> 't5', and so on. So 't5' is a terminal and can be produced by several NTs.\n\nSimilarly, 't5' at position 1 in the string could also be produced by the same NTs. The third character is 't2', which can be produced by NT52, NT21, etc. The fourth is 't3', produced by NT5, NT27, etc. The fifth is 't5' again.\n\nBut this approach seems a bit tedious for a human, so maybe looking at the structure of the string can help. Let's see: the string is `t5 t5 t2 t3 t5`.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal symbol that branches from a non-terminal, so in a Chomsky Normal Form context-free grammar, each non-terminal can produce two terminals or a non-terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nSo to generate the string `t5 t5 t2 t3 t5`, we need to split the production into segments, where each segment is a possible derivation of each 't'.\n\nBut the length of the string is 5, which is odd. Wait, in CNF, every production splits into two parts, so the number of symbols in a derived string must be a power of 2. Wait, that's right! Because starting from S, which is one symbol, each step doubles the number of symbols, so after n steps, you have 2^n symbols. Therefore, the length of the string must be a power of 2, like 2,4,8,16, etc.\n\nBut our string length is 5, which is not a power of 2, so it's impossible for it to be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So regardless of the grammar details, any string with a length not equal to 2^n cannot be generated, which applies to this case.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 5, which is not a power of 2. Since context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form generate strings of length 2^n, this string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form has productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal. In this case, some of the productions for the non-terminals are terminals like 't3', 't5', 't2', etc. So, each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules provided. I see that several non-terminals expand into terminals and other non-terminals. For example, `NT5` expands into `t4 t3`, `NT1` into `t58 t41`, and so on. But I also notice that some non-terminals, like `S`, expand into other non-terminals, e.g., `S -> NT28 NT17`.\n\nThe string we're evaluating is `t3 t5 t2 t4 t5`. So, we have five tokens. Since each production step reduces the number of symbols by one (each non-terminal produces two symbols, one or both of which could be non-terminals), the number of symbols in the string corresponds to the number of production steps taken. For a string of length N, the number of productions is N-1. Here, N is 5, so we should have 4 productions.\n\nBut wait, initially, the start symbol S would expand into two non-terminals, then each of those could expand further, and so on.

{"custom_id":"request-63","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string to evaluate is `t5 t5 t2 t0 t3 t5`, and the grammar is quite large with many production rules. I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way of writing context-free grammars where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in parsing with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I don't need that here.\n\nThe task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions in the grammar. The string has six tokens: t5, t5, t2, t0, t3, t5. Each of these represents a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me first parse the string to see how it can be broken down. The string is t5 t5 t2 t0 t3 t5, which I'll write as T = [t5, t5, t2, t0, t3, t5]. The idea is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar's derivations starting from S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation of any string results in a binary tree structure. Each production either adds one non-terminal or replaces it with two. So, the length of the string should match (n-1)*2 +1 where n is the number of terminals. Here, n=6, so the number of symbols in the derivation should be 11 (since 2*6-1=11).\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key is to see if each terminal in the string is produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal can be expanded into terminals or other non-terminals. I should try to see if there's a derivation path from S to the string T.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S expands into NT28 and NT17. So the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 can produce either NT17 NT7 or NT7 NT7. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 or NT7 NT7? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7 or NT7 NT19. Wait, from the given grammar:\n\nThe production for NT28 is S -> NT28 NT17, and NT28's rule is:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28 has two options:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nOR\nNT28 -> NT7 NT7?\n\nWait, no, let me look back. The given grammar has:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nand also other entries, but maybe I misread.\n\nLooking again, yes, the NT28 entry is:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nBut wait, no, in the given grammar, under NT28:\n\nThe entries are:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT40 NT13\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar provided, under NT28:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT40 NT13\n\nWait, no, the given grammar lists NT28 as:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nAnd other rules. So NT28 can produce two things: NT17 NT7 or NT40 NT13.\n\nHmm, so wait, initially S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, to expand NT28, which can be either NT17 NT7 or NT40 NT13.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT28 NT17, the first step is S \u2192 [NT17 NT7] NT17 or [NT40 NT13] NT17.\n\nSimilarly, each non-terminal can be expanded step by step.\n\nLet me try to think about the string T. Each t is a terminal symbol. So the string is t5 t5 t2 t0 t3 t5. So I need to see if the derivation can produce these terminals in this order.\n\nPerhaps I should approach this by reverse engineering. Starting from the string, see if each terminal can be matched by a production, working backwards.\n\nBut I think more straightforward is to see which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal either produces two non-terminals or some terminals.\n\nWait, but some of the NTs have rules that end in terminals. For example, NT7 has production NT7 -> NT2 NT19, NT7 -> NT13 NT30, etc. Looking for which NTs can produce a single terminal, but in CNF, all productions must be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, for example, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nNT7 -> NT2 NT13\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n...\n\nWait, but actually, I might be mistaken. Wait, no: in CNF, each production must be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So if any NT has a production that is a \u2192 multiple terminals, like a \u2192 a1 a2 a3, that's not CNF. Therefore, the given grammar is in CNF because all the productions have either two non-terminals or a single terminal as the right-hand side.\n\nSo, in this grammar, each NT is either a terminal (if it has a production to a terminal) or can be split into two parts.\n\nLooking into the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT52 \u2192 't2' (i.e., the production is NT52 \u2192 't2')? Wait, looking at the grammar, let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar's productions, I see:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2' (I think from the given list, which has NT52 -> 't2')\n- NT29 -> 't5' (since in the list, NT52 -> 't2', and others that produce t's are listed as NT29 -> 't5' but wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back through the grammar provided, I see several entries where NTs produce terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't3'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT21 -> 't0'\n- NT27 -> 't1'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3' (wait, in the production list, NT54 has two endings: NT54 -> 't3' and NT54 -> NT35 NT33. So, wait, but that would be conflicting because in CNF, each NT can have only two forms. Wait, no, maybe I read the grammar incorrectly.\n\nWait, let's take it step by step. The user provided a rather long list of production rules, each starting with 'NTxyz ->'. So each production is for a specific NT.\n\nFor example, looking for productions where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT27 -> 't6' (Wait, in the list, it's NT27 -> 't1'? No, let me check: looking through the list.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of all NTs and their possible productions, whether they produce a terminal or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to note that each NT which has a production to a terminal can directly produce that terminal. For instance, NT52 has a production to 't2'; so NT52 can produce 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 can produce 't5', and other NTs. So when building the derivation, each terminal in the string must come from such an NT production.\n\nNow, the string is t5 t5 t2 t0 t3 t5.\n\nSo, let's parse the string from the right, working backwards, to see if we can match each terminal to a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nBut maybe breaking it down into parts.\n\nSince the string starts with t5, let's see what NTs can produce t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't5'? Wait, in the grammar, what's NT5? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the grammar, do any NTs produce 't5' as a terminal?\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nAlso, NT9 \u2192 't3', but not 't5'.\n\nWait, looking again, other NTs:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Oh wait, but in the provided context, some rules have terminal symbols like 't5', 't3', etc. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, most rules are between non-terminals, but some have a mix? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules seem to have two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, etc. But wait, at the bottom, some NT rules like NT5 -> NT43 NT24, but also at the end, some rules end with terminals like 't5', 't3', etc. For example, NT17 -> 't3' and NT20 -> 't4'. So that means in the grammar, some of the non-terminals have rules that produce a terminal symbol. So the grammar allows for production of terminal symbols as well, which is okay because the grammar can generate strings by replacing non-terminals with terminals.\n\nSo the string given is `t5 t5 t2 t0 t4 t5`, which is a sequence of six terminals. So each of these must be generated by the grammar through the rules.\n\nThe approach is probably to construct a parse tree for the given string, starting from the start symbol S and decomposing the string step by step. Alternatively, since the string is small, I can try to trace back through the grammar rules to see if I can generate the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into each symbol: t5, t5, t2, t0, t4, t5.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S -> NT28 NT17. So S is the start, and we have two symbols to produce: NT28 and NT17. So the string should be a combination of the productions of NT28 and NT17 in some order.\n\nLooking at NT17's production: NT17 -> \u2018t3\u2019 or 't5'. Since the string starts with t5, which is produced by NT17, I will choose the production NT17 -> 't5'.\n\nThen the next part comes from NT28. Let's look at NT28's production: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So NT28 expands into two non-terminals NT17 and NT7. So the next two symbols in the string should come from NT17 and NT7.\n\nThe remaining string after the first 't5' (from NT17) is: t5 t2 t0 t4 t5. So the next symbol is t5, which could be from NT17 or another NT. Wait, but wait, the production is NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which are two non-terminals. So we need to process NT17 and NT7.\n\nThe first symbol after the initial t5 is t5 again. Let's process NT28: it's split into NT17 and NT7. First, process NT17: which can be 't5' or 't3'. Since the next symbol is t5, let's have NT17 produce 't5'. So now, the processed symbols are t5 (from NT17) and we have to process NT7 next.\n\nBut wait, the string is t5, t5, t2, t0, t4, t5. After t5 (from S), the next symbol is t5, which comes from NT17. Then, we have to process NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions: several options. Let's see: NT7 can be NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, NT4 NT48, NT2 NT19 again, or NT7 -> NT4 NT48.\n\nWait, let's list all NT7 productions:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19 (same as first)\nNT7 -> NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nWait, so NT7 can produce other non-terminals or eventually terminals.\n\nLooking at the current position: after processing the first two symbols (t5 from NT17 and t5 from NT17), the next symbol is t2. So after the initial S -> NT28 NT17 (with NT17 -> t5), we now have to process NT28 as NT17 and NT7. So after handling NT17 (t5), we handle NT7, which should produce the next symbol t2.\n\nLooking at NT7's options, which can produce t2 or eventually lead to t2. Let's see:\n\nNT7 can produce:\n\n- NT2 NT19: which are two non-terminals.\n- Can any of these non-terminals produce t2? Let's check NT2's production.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 -> NT54 NT10, NT27 -> NT7 NT41, NT32 -> NT46 NT1, etc. Wait, I'm not sure. Let me check NT2's productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> NT54 NT10\nNT27 -> NT7 NT41\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list out NT2's productions:\n\nLooking back, the grammar is provided, and I can look for NT2 production rules:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT23 -> NT7 NT41\nNT2 -> NT54 NT10\nAh, right, so NT2 is NT54 NT10. Wait, no, that's a production for another NT23. Wait, no. Looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT2 as the left-hand side. So:\n\nI think I might have made a mistake. Let me scan through the grammar entries:\n\nLooking through the 'NT' and their productions, I see:\n\nNT24 -> NT53 NT43\n...\nNT4 -> NT5 NT36\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let me keep looking for NT2.\n\nAh, in the grammar, looking through:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT20 -> NT52 NT26\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the fact that after processing NT7, which needs to produce 't2', I can check which production for NT7 can lead to 't2'.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48: which is two non-terminals. NT4 and NT48.\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19: which are NT2 and NT19.\n\nWait, looking at NT2's productions: NT2 -> NT54 NT10. But NT10 also has production NT23 NT21. Not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking for where 't2' is produced. Wait, perhaps 't2' is produced by some rule. Wait, looking at the grammar, some rules have terminals. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT21: perhaps?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should check the terminal symbols. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT27 -> NT17 NT27\nNT57 -> NT19 NT9\nNT27 -> NT4 NT3\n...\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.\n\nThe remaining string after the initial two t5's is t2 t0 t4 t5. So after the first two, the next should be t2, which is the next symbol. So after handling NT17 (t5) and the first part of NT28 (which is another NT17), handling the second part (NT7) should generate t2.\n\nLooking at NT7's possible productions:\n\nIf NT7 -> 't2 NT'? Wait no, looking at the grammar, the rules for NT7 are all non-terminals:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nNT7 -> NT9 NT? Wait no.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if any of these non-terminals can lead to 't2'. Let me look for rules that produce 't2':\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT17 -> 't3' and 't5'. So no. Let's look for 't2' elsewhere.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminals, I see:\n\nWait, does any NT produce 't2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-84","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string `t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) consists of non-terminal symbols (like S, NTx) and terminal symbols (like t3, t4, etc.). In Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has several production rules, all in CNF. My task is to see if the string can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the string `t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5`, I notice it's 7 tokens long. I remember that in CFGs, the number of symbols in the string relates to the parse tree's height and structure. Specifically, the minimum number of steps to derive the string can be calculated based on the productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to try to derive the string step by step. Let's see.\n\nFirst, S is the start symbol. Looking at the productions, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S must be replaced by NT28 and NT17. Let's work with NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 becomes NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, the string starts with S, which is NT28 NT17. Replacing S, we have NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so the string becomes NT17 NT7 NT17. Then, the NT17s can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So each NT17 becomes NT1 and NT58.\n\nContinuing the breakdown:\n\n- NT17 (from S's first NT17 in S\u2192NT28NT17) \u2192 NT1 NT58\n- The second NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT1 NT58) (NT1 NT58) \u2192 NT1 NT58 NT1 NT58\n\nNow the string is nt1 nt58 nt1 nt58. But the original string starts with t3, so let's see nt1's production.\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. So each NT1 becomes NT58 and NT41.\n\nSo replacing each NT1, we have:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\n\nSo the string becomes nt58 nt41 nt58 nt41\n\nNow, NT58 is a non-terminal. Looking at NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. So each NT58 becomes NT1 NT15.\n\nReplacing NT58s:\n\n- nt58 \u2192 NT1 NT15\n- nt58 \u2192 NT1 NT15\n\nSo the string becomes NT1 NT15 NT41 NT1 NT15 NT41\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach. Perhaps looking for the terminals in the target string and see how they can be derived.\n\nLet's consider the target string: t3, t3, t3, t3, t2, t4, t5.\n\nIn the grammar, terminals are things like t3, t4, t5, etc. So I'll look for how these can be derived.\n\nI'll start from the end and see if I can work backwards.\n\nLooking for 't5' in the grammar. Do any productions produce 't5'? Let me scan through the rules.\n\nYes, there's a production NT29 \u2192 't5'. So any time we have NT29 in a derivation, it can produce 't5'. Similarly, NT52 \u2192 't2', NT20 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't5', which must come from an NT29. Similarly, before that is 't4', which could come from NT20, 't2' from NT20 or NT52, 't3's from various places.\n\nMaybe it's better to try to build the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me try starting from the beginning.\n\nWe have S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo S becomes NT28 and NT17. We need to derive t3 t3 t3 t3 t2 t4 t5.\n\nSo let's see what NT28 and NT17 can become.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 becomes NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So each NT17 becomes NT1 and NT58.\n\nThen, each NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Let's take one NT1: it becomes NT58 and NT41.\n\nSimilarly, the other NT1 (from the previous step) also becomes NT58 and NT41.\n\nSo now, our tokens are NT58, NT41, NT58, NT41.\n\nEach NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. So replacing each NT58 with NT1 and NT15.\n\nSo now, the tokens are NT1, NT15, NT41, NT1, NT15, NT41.\n\nNow, each NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. So replacing each NT1, we get NT58 NT41 and then NT58 NT41.\n\nThis seems to be expanding infinitely. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the string composition. Let's see if all the terminals can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, there are four 't3's, one 't2', one 't4', and one 't5'.\n\nI know that 't3' can come from several NTs. For example, NT3 \u2192 't3', NT6 \u2192 't4', NT9 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, wait, looking back at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Both NT28 and NT17 are non-terminals. So the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nEach of these NTs can be replaced by other NTs until we get to terminals.\n\nI'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to see how many productions I would need to get seven terminals.\n\nWait, each application of a production splits a non-terminal into two, increasing the number of symbols by one each time. So if we start with one symbol (S), after one expansion, it's two symbols. After two expansions, it's up to four symbols, etc. But this might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, the number of terminals in the string is 7, so perhaps the tree depth is about 7, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string is a concatenation of several 't3's, 't2's, etc., that can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't2' comes from NT52. So to get a 't2', we need to have a NT52, which can be derived by... Looking at NT52 \u2192 't2' (wait, no, in the given grammar, NT52 \u2192 't2'). Yes, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n\nSo to derive 't2', we need NT52, which is in the string at position 5. So somewhere in the derivation, we must have a NT52 which replaces to 't2'.\n\nSimilarly, 't4' comes from NT20, as NT20 \u2192 't4'. So we have 't4' at position 6.\n\n't5' comes from NT29, as NT29 \u2192 't5' at position 7.\n\nSo, maybe the derivation would involve getting 't3's from NT3, NT6, etc.\n\nBut I'm getting lost. Maybe it's better to try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the grammar can generate any string of t3's, t2's, t4's, etc., as long as they follow the expansion rules.\n\nBut wait, looking more closely, I notice that the productions only involve certain sequences. For example, 't3's can come from NT3 (which is NT3\u2192't3'), or other NTs that eventually resolve to 't3's.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the string is too long or has a combination that's not possible.\n\nWait, another approach: since all the terminals in the string are either 't2', 't3', 't4', or 't5', and those correspond to specific NTs in the grammar, maybe I can see if the grammar includes these NTs in their productions.\n\nFor example, 't3' can come from NT3, NT6 (if NT6 \u2192 't3'), NT2 (if any NT2 \u2192 't3'), but"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me look at the given grammar to confirm the structure.\n\nWait, the grammar provided has all production rules looking like S \u2192 NT X Y, where NTs are on the left and terminals or other NTs on the right. So yes, it seems to be in Chomsky normal form. Each production is either two NTs or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string has seven tokens, which are the 't' followed by numbers. From the grammar, I see that the terminals are t0, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, etc. So each token in the string must correspond to one of these terminals. The string is `t3 t3 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3`. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nI think the way to approach this is by using a parsing strategy, maybe recursive descent or simulating the derivation. Alternatively, I could try to find a leftmost derivation that results in this string. But since it's a bit involved, maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed step by step using the given grammar.\n\nStarting from the top symbol S, which in the given grammar is the start symbol: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first step would be to derive S into NT28 followed by NT17. Now, each of these NTs can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17. Wait, no, let me re-examine. Actually, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nSo the first part is NT17, which produces 't5'. So the first token is t3? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are like t3, t0, etc. So 't3' is a terminal, and it's produced by some NT.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I see that for example, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, but also some NTs produce terminals. Like NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47, but wait, in the given list, I think I see some NTs that directly produce 't' values.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTs directly producing t tokens except perhaps some. Wait, I think I might have misread the grammar. Let me go back.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the productions seem to have some cases where NTs are expanded into a terminal and another NT. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, but also, looking further, I see something like NT17 \u2192 't5'. Yes, looking at the end of the grammar, each NT is listed with possible productions that include terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5'. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't3', NT2 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nSo this helps because we can see which NTs produce which terminals. Now, the string is `t3 t3 t3 t0 t2 t4 t3`. So the question is whether this can be derived from S.\n\nLet me try to see how the first 't3' can come. So S expands to NT28 NT17. Let's see what NT28 becomes. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, looking at NT28's expansion, perhaps that's not the right path. Maybe I should look for alternative expansions for NT28 or NT17 to see if there are terminals involved.\n\nWait, looking at NT17's production, I see that NT17 \u2192 't5'. So if I can get a 't5' in the string, that's possible. But in the given string, the first token is 't3', not 't5'. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo if NT17 can only produce 't5', then any occurrence of t5 in the string would require that. But here, the string starts with 't3'. So how can that happen? Maybe NT17 is not the first step. Wait, perhaps the string starts with 't3', so the first step must produce 't3' somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking for where the string begins with 't3'. So which NTs produce 't3'? From the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't5', NT2 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't2', NT5 \u2192 't3', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT27 \u2192 't6', NT7 \u2192 't3', NT6 \u2192 't4', etc. Wait, let me list all NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3' (twice)\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\nWait, wait, no, NT17 is 't5'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me parse each line of the grammar to see which NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n- NT48 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\n- NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT44 \u2192 NT30 NT8\n- NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n- NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n- NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46\n- NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT43\n- NT23 \u2192 NT51 NT27\n- NT11 \u2192 NT39 NT24\n- NT26 \u2192 NT0 NT10\n- NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46\n- NT11 \u2192 NT5 NT45\n- NT40 \u2192 NT4 NT54\n- NT39 \u2192 NT13 NT32\n- NT54 \u2192 NT23 NT28\n- NT32 \u2192 NT52 NT40\n- NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11\n- NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21\n- NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10\n- NT29 \u2192 NT5 NT53\n- NT46 \u2192 NT13 NT47\n- NT45 \u2192 NT56 NT33\n- NT56 \u2192 NT3 NT52\n- NT14 \u2192 NT41 NT44\n- NT41 \u2192 NT33 NT2\n- NT45 \u2192 NT0 NT45\n- NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n- NT53 \u2192 NT44 NT21\n- NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56\n- NT43 \u2192 NT21 NT21\n- NT11 \u2192 NT19 NT48\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n- NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26\n- NT54 \u2192 NT52 NT35\n- NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33\n- NT20 \u2192 NT21 NT57\n- NT24 \u2192 NT41 NT20\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT35\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41\n- NT39 \u2192 NT39 NT10\n- NT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7\n- NT12 \u2192 NT29 NT13\n- NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT47 \u2192 NT57 NT33\n- NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41\n- NT12 \u2192 NT46 NT53\n- NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT3\n- NT20 \u2192 NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-100","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t0 t3`, and the grammar has all the productions defined. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the given grammar, I can see that every production starts with a capital letter (non-terminal) on the left and is either expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. That checks out, so the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t0 t3`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, which corresponds to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. For example, 't3' corresponds to NT3, 't2' to NT2, and so on.\n\nMy approach should be to use a parsing method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for this purpose. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell represents whether a particular substring can be generated by a specific non-terminal, iterating over lengths of the substring.\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals that correspond to the terminals in the string. The terminals present are t3, t2, t4, t5, t0, t6. Translating these, we have:\n\n- t3 \u2192 NT3\n- t2 \u2192 NT2\n- t4 \u2192 NT4\n- t5 \u2192 NT5\n- t0 \u2192 NT0\n- t6 \u2192 NT6\n\nSo, the string in terms of non-terminals is: NT3, NT2, NT4, NT5, NT3, NT0, NT0, NT3.\n\nNow, I'll list all the productions that involve these non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's collect all the productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is any of NT3, NT2, NT4, NT5, NT0, or NT6.\n\nNT3:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (but 17 is t5, which is NT17 \u2192 t5. So NT27 \u2192 NT5 NT27)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 \u2192 NT55 is NT29 \u2192 t3 NT30? Wait, maybe I should reconstruct all NT3 productions correctly.\n\nWait, let me parse through the grammar step by step.\n\nStarting with NT3:\nNT3 \u2192 NT55 NT6 \u2192 NT29 NT54? Wait, maybe it's better to see all possible productions for each NT.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to use the CYK algorithm, even though I'm trying to do it manually.\n\nLet me write down all productions for each NT:\n\n1. NT3:\n   - NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 (17 is t5, so NT27 \u2192 NT5 NT27)\n   - NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 \u2192 but 55 is NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46\n     - Wait, that might not be straightforward. Maybe looking at the grammar step by step:\n\nNT3: I see several references:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n- NT3 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n- NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n- NT33 \u2192 NT6 NT56\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\n- NT55 \u2192 NT28 NT46\n- NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n- So perhaps NT3 has multiple productions, but I think I need to list all rules where the LHS is one of the relevant NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should list all productions for each relevant NT.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps it's better to focus on parsing.\n\nThe CYK algorithm starts by initializing each position in the table to possible non-terminals that can derive the single terminal at that position.\n\nEach position i corresponds to the i-th character in the string.\n\nThe string is 8 characters long: positions 1 to 8.\n\nFirst, for each position i, determine all NTs that can produce the string starting at i and of length 1.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, we'll find the NTs that can directly produce it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't3' \u2192 NT3\n- 't2' \u2192 NT2\n- 't4' \u2192 NT4\n- 't5' \u2192 NT5\n- 't3' \u2192 NT3\n- 't0' \u2192 NT0\n- 't0' \u2192 NT0\n- 't3' \u2192 NT3\n\nLet's list the possible NTs for each 't' part:\n\nt3: NT3 (from productions like NT3 \u2192 a, though in this case, looking at the grammar, are there any productions where LHS is a terminal? No, because the grammar is in CNF. So the only way to get t3 is through a production rule where NT3 \u2192 t3... Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar list:\n\nWait, checking the grammar for NT3:\n\nFrom the given productions, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT33 NT3\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT6 NT56\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 \u2192 which is t5 (NT17) and NT27 again.\n\nSo for 't3', it's possible if any production leads to NT3 \u2192 t3. Scanning through, I don't see such a production. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, that can't be. If the grammar doesn't have a production where NT3 \u2192 t3, then 't3' can't be generated by this grammar. So, for example:\n\nNT3's productions are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT27 NT17 \u2192 which is t5 and t5 (since NT17 \u2192 t5)\n- Not a terminal, so it can't directly produce t3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, to derive a single terminal symbol, a non-terminal A must have a production A \u2192 a.\n\nSo, looking at the grammar, for each NT, do they have a production that terminates with a single 'a'? Or in this case, 't3', 't2', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's check for each relevant NT:\n\n- NT3: Do any of its productions end up with a single terminal?\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT33 NT3 (twice), so both require two non-terminals.\n\nAlso, NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, which would require NT19 and NT55 to generate. So, NT3 cannot directly produce 't3'.\n\nSimilarly, checking NT27:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27. Since NT17 is t5, but NT27 must produce another NT after that, which isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's check all NTS in the grammar that might directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10. NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33. So two steps.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 (so two steps)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT3. So NT6 can produce t4 and NT3, but NT3 doesn't produce t6. Wait, actually, looking deeper: NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT3, which is 't4' and 't3' as NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 and NT3 \u2192 possibly 't3'?\n\nWait, no. Maybe NT6 is leading somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if any of the NTs have a direct production to a terminal:\n\nLooking closely, for example:\n\nNT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36. Also, NT0 is in the grammar as translating to 't5'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the terminal 't3' corresponds to NT3. So, perhaps NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36, which is 't5' and 'something else.\n\nAlternatively, I think I'm getting lost. Maybe it's better to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the CYK algorithm.\n\nFirst, list all the terminals and their positions:\n\nPositions: 1: t3, 2: t2, 3: t4, 4: t5, 5: t3, 6: t0, 7: t0, 8: t3.\n\nWe can represent these as positions 1 to 8.\n\nNow, the CYK algorithm initializes a table where each cell (i,j) represents the range of terminals from i to j, and whether some NT can derive this substring.\n\nBut since the string is 8 symbols,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-115","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string `t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t3 t3` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string ends with multiple `t3` symbols. In the grammar, several rules produce `t3`. For example, S starts as NT28 NT17, and according to the grammar, some rules produce terminals like `t3`, such as NT7 -> NT4 NT48, and others that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of terminal symbols starting with `t3`. Let me try to map how the non-terminals could expand to these terminals.\n\nThe string is `t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t3 t3`. Let's denote each `t` as a terminal symbol. Each T is a terminal.\n\nStarting with the top symbol S, which is NT28 NT17. So, each of NT28 and NT17 must expand into a sequence that starts with the terminals in the string.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7. Wait, no. Looking back, the production for NT28 is:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no, the production for NT28 is:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7. But checking again, I think I might have mixed up. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT28 is:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33\n\nSimilarly, NT17 expands as:\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\nNT17 -> NT58 NT41\nND17 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, the starting point is S -> NT28 NT17, so we need to see how NT28 and NT17 can produce the string.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to see if the entire sequence of `t3 t1 t0 t3 t2 t0 t0 t3 t3` can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that each production in CNF is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals, I can try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each symbol in the string must be generated by either a direct production or through intermediate steps that don't produce longer sequences.\n\nBut thinking deeper, the string has multiple `t3` in the beginning. For instance, the first `t3` could come from a production of NT28 or NT44, since looking at the grammar:\n\nNT28 can produce NT17 NT7, which may lead to a `t3` eventually. Wait, let me see the productions for NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nOR\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33\n\nSo, let's explore NT28.\n\nIf NT28 -> NT17 NT7, then both NT17 and NT7 need to produce the required terminals.\n\nBut looking at NT17, which expands to:\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58 or other rules, but looking at the end symbols, perhaps NT17 can produce `t3`.\n\nWait, no. I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the string from end to start. So, reverse the string: `t3 t3 t0 t0 t2 t0 t3 t1 t3`.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. Since the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, each step reduces the number of symbols by one. So the string has 9 symbols, which is odd. Let's see if that fits.\n\nWait, the length of the string is 9, which means that the number of productions needed would be such that 2^k - 1 = 9, which would imply k=4 because 2^4=16; 16-1=15? No, that doesn't match. Alternatively, each production step reduces the number of symbols by one, so starting from S, each step adds a non-terminal. The length of the string is 9, so it would take 8 productions, each adding a symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this by parsing using a method like CYK algorithm, but given the time, maybe try to see if the string can be produced by starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the grammar, all productions are binary, so the parse tree will have a structure where non-terminals branch into two non-terminals, until we get to the terminals.\n\nAnother approach: check if all the `t3` can be produced from some rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce `t3`:\n\nNT7 can produce `t3` via NT7 -> NT4 NT48, and then NT48 can produce `t3` via NT48 -> NT20 NT26, which then might go to NT20 -> t3, maybe?\n\nWait, let me check the productions of NT48: NT48 -> NT20 NT26. Wait, no, looking back: NT48's productions are:\n\nLooking up NT48:\n\nNT48 -> NT20 NT26\n\nWait, no. Wait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT48 -> NT20 NT26\n\nWait, that's correct. So NT48 expands to NT20 NT26.\n\nThen, NT26 can be:\n\nNT26 -> NT0 NT10\n\nOr NT26 -> NT52 NT40\n\nBut looking for `t3`, let's see NT26 can't produce `t3` directly.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 has productions NT33 NT35, NT35 could produce t3, yes.\n\nWait, better to see each terminal symbol and their possible predecessors.\n\nLet me list each 't' and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, etc. Let's see which non-terminals can directly produce each:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, each non-terminal's productions consist of either a single terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking for which non-terminals can produce a specific 't' symbol:\n\n- t0: Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t0 except perhaps some that end with it. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at NT52: NT52 -> 't2' and another non-terminal. Wait, no, NT52's productions end with 't2'? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, NT52 is a non-terminal, and its productions are:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT52 has a production: NT52 -> NT20 NT36, but in another context. Or perhaps somewhere else. Wait, no, looking through the provided grammar, there's a production saying NT52 -> NT20 NT36 is one of the options. Alternatively, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT20 has a production NT20 -> 't3'.\n\nSo perhaps let's make a list.\n\nt0: Maybe NT9 produces NT43 NT54, etc. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's think about each terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT54 can directly produce 't3'\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT20, one of its productions is NT20 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT20 can produce 't3'.\n\nLooking for t1:\n\nNT11 can produce 't2', but maybe others. Let's check if any NT can produce 't1'.

{"custom_id":"request-117","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string \"t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t3\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Okay, let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're dealing with.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar consists of multiple rules (productions) that break down non-terminals into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals, which are the letters t0 to t9. The starting symbol is S, which has a production that starts with NT57 -> NT28 NT17. Wait, no, looking back, the start symbol S's production is S -> NT28 NT17. Hmm, no, wait\u2014it says S -> NT28 NT17. But in the grammar list, each production is written as X -> Y Z. So, the first thing I should do is see all the productions and see how they can lead to the string.\n\nThe string given is \"t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t3\". So, in terms of the grammar, each \"t\" probably corresponds to a terminal symbol, right? For example, t3 is the terminal '3', t5 is '5', and so on.\n\nNow, I need to map the string to the grammar's terminals. Let me write down the string as a sequence of terminals: t3, t5, t2, t3, t5, t2, t3, t4, t3. So, each of these is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here should be to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, we can use something like the CYK algorithm or manually try to derive the string step by step. But since the grammar is a bit complex, maybe I can look for patterns or see if there's a way to generate this string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S -> NT28 NT17. So S breaks down into NT28 and NT17. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nNT28's production is NT17 NT7. So, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Now, NT17's production is NT1 NT58, and NT7 has a few productions: either NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30. Let's explore.\n\nIf NT7 is NT2 NT19, then NT2's production is NT54 NT10. Wait, but hold on\u2014this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps starting with a different path. Maybe another NT28 production?\n\nLooking back, NT28 only has one production: NT17 NT7. So we have to follow that. So S -> NT28 NT17 becomes S -> NT17 NT7 NT17. Then NT17 is NT1 NT58, so S becomes NT1 NT58 NT7 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, considering possible splits and using the productions.\n\nThe string is t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t3.\n\nThinking about the start symbol S, which is NT28 NT17. So the entire string must come from NT28 and NT17. Let's focus on the first part: t3 and t5.\n\nWait, S -> NT28 NT17, so the entire string must be the concatenation of NT28's production and NT17's production. So perhaps the string is generated by NT28 producing a sequence ending with t2 and NT17 producing t2, etc. Wait, no, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should think of the entire string as being generated by NT28 NT17. So we need to split the string into two parts: one from NT28 and the other from NT17.\n\nGiven that, let's see the string: t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t3.\n\nSo first part is up to a split point n, and the second part starts at n+1.\n\nThe idea is to try all possible split points and see if any split allows both NT28 and NT17 to generate their respective parts.\n\nBut wait, the string has 9 tokens. So for each possible split from 1 to 8, we can check if the first k tokens can be generated by NT28 and the remaining 9 - k by NT17.\n\nBut NT28 is NT17 NT7, which is two parts. Wait, S itself is NT28 NT17, each of which is two. NT28 is NT17 NT7, so S is NT17 NT7 NT17. So S generates a string that is the concatenation of NT17, NT7, and NT17, which could produce three parts.\n\nBut the string given is 9 tokens. So perhaps we can see how NT17 and NT7 can generate sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to look at the grammar's NT17, NT7, and so on, to see the paths they can take.\n\nLet me start by looking at NT17: from the grammar, NT17 has a production NT1 NT58.

For example, NT17 can either be the terminal 't5' or be split into NT1 and NT58, which themselves can be further split or be terminals. Similarly, NT30 can be 't4' or 't3', and so on.\n\nSo, looking back at the string, the first token is t3. Let's see how that can be generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 can generate 't3' as a terminal. But in the string, the first token is t3, which would correspond to NT3. But S is NT28 NT17. So maybe we need to find a way to get t3 from S.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think step by step.\n\nThe string is t3 t5 t2 t3 t5 t2 t3 t4 t3.\n\nI think a good approach might be to parse this string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me write the string as a list: ['t3', 't5', 't2', 't3', 't5', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't3'].\n\nS is NT28 NT17.

{"custom_id":"request-143","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine whether the given string \"t5 t3 t4 t5 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3\" can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar looks like it includes both non-terminals (denoted with 'N' followed by numbers) and terminals, with the right-hand sides of the productions being either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nI notice that some of the non-terminals directly produce terminals (e.g., NT17 -> t5, NT54 -> t3, etc.). These are our terminal productions, which are the leaves of the parse tree. The non-terminals that aren't terminal produce other non-terminals. So the task is to build a derivation starting from the start symbol S and reach the given string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which has the production S -> NT28 NT17. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 produce. From the rules, NT17 -> t5. NT28 has the production NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So we can replace NT28 with NT17 NT7.\n\nNow, let's break this down:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) NT17 \u2192 t5 NT7 t5\n\nSo, the first part is t5, then NT7, then another t5. Now, what does NT7 produce? Looking at the rules, NT7 can be NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, or NT4 NT48. \n\nLet's pick one possibility and see where it leads. Hmm, the string after the initial t5 is followed by something that eventually needs to result in t3, t4, etc. Let's try taking NT7 as NT13 NT30.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t5 NT13 NT30 t5\n\nNow, NT30 has a production NT30 \u2192 NT44 NT13. So replacing NT30 gives us t5 NT13 NT44 NT13 t5.\n\nNT44 has two productions: NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14 or NT30 NT8. Let's try NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14 first.\n\nSo now we have t5 NT13 NT21 NT14 t5.\n\nNT14 can be NT53 NT5. So replacing NT14: t5 NT13 NT21 NT53 NT5 t5.\n\nWhat about NT53? It can be NT44 NT21 or NT6 NT56. Given that, maybe NT44 is involved again. But wait, that might complicate things. Maybe there's a better path. Let me backtrack a bit.\n\nAlternative path: Maybe from S, instead of breaking down S into NT28 NT17, perhaps other productions could lead us to the string more directly. But I don't think so because the string starts with 't5', which is directly from NT17. So S must start with NT28's parts, which includes NT17.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The initial substitution is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which leads to t5 NT7 t5. So the string starts with t5, and then we need to derive the rest t3 t4 t5 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3.\n\nSo after the initial t5, we have NT7, which needs to produce a sequence that connects to the rest of the string. Let's see, NT7 can be NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, or NT4 NT48.\n\nLooking at the string after the first t5, the next term is t3, which is in the given string. Hmm, perhaps NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo S \u2192 t5 NT13 NT30 t5. Now, NT30 is NT44 NT13. So replacing NT30: t5 NT13 NT44 NT13 t5.\n\nNow, NT44 can be NT21 NT14 or NT30 NT8. Let's try NT44 \u2192 NT21 NT14.\n\nSo now we have t5 NT13 NT21 NT14 t5.\n\nNT14 is NT53 NT5. So substituting NT14: t5 NT13 NT21 NT53 NT5 t5.\n\nWhat about NT53? It can be NT44 NT21 or NT6 NT56. Let's try NT53 \u2192 NT44 NT21.\n\nThen, we have t5 NT13 NT21 NT44 NT21 NT5 t5.\n\nWait, this seems to be getting complex quickly, and the string we're trying to generate is t5 t3 t4 t5 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3. The current path leads us to t5 followed by various non-terminals, but maybe this isn't the right path because the string includes longer sequences that might not align.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider other production paths for NT7 initially. Let's try NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 instead.\n\nSo, S \u2192 t5 NT2 NT19 t5. NT2 is NT54 NT10, so replacing NT2: t5 NT54 NT10 NT19 t5.\n\nLooking at NT54: it can be NT35 NT33 or NT3 NT2. Let's say NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33.\n\nSo, t5 NT35 NT33 NT10 NT19 t5.\n\nBut wait, the string is t5 t3 t4 t5 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3. I'm not seeing how this leads directly. Maybe this path isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different initial substitution for the start symbol or a different approach to the breakdown. Maybe instead of starting with S, I can build the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t3 t4 t5 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3.\n\nBreaking it down from the left, the first token is t5, which we know comes from NT17. So, the start symbol S must expand to include NT28 and NT17, which gives us t5, then NT7, then another t5 or other terms. But the second term is t3, which suggests that after t5, the next token is t3.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first t5, NT7 produces a string that starts with t3. Let's see: NT7's options are NT2 NT19, which would produce t3 (since NT2 is t54 t10, and from the rules, NT54 is 't3').\n\nWait, maybe NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19.

{"custom_id":"request-136","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes parsing easier.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It seems like all non-terminals on the left side produce two non-terminals on the right, or some are terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S splits into NT28 and NT17. Let me note this. Then, each of these NTs (non-terminals) have their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT28: according to the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So after S gives NT28, that splits into NT17 and NT7. Now, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, as per the rules. Wait, no, looking back: NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 and also NT17 \u2192 NT27 NT27. So I might need to consider which one it uses.\n\nWait, let me check each step carefully. Let's start breaking down the string into parts. The string is `t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t3`. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two terminals or two non-terminals, and every left-hand side (LHS) rule has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side (RHS).\n\nSo the string has 10 tokens, which is a specific length. Let me see if the tree of productions can result in exactly this sequence.\n\nLet me consider the start rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 produces NT17 NT7. Then NT17 \u2192 two options: either NT1 NT58 or NT27 NT27. Let's choose one. Suppose it goes to NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So NT17 becomes ND1 and NT58. NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41 as per the rule NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Wait, no, looking back: NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41 and also other productions? Let me check the NT1 rules. Looking at the grammar, I see NT1 is defined as NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41, NTL4 \u2192 NT33 NT2, etc. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the relevant rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\nNT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41\nNT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15\nNT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\nNT19 \u2192 NT4 NT30\nWait, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire string as a binary tree and see if each node (non-terminal) can be expanded appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that each non-terminal corresponds to a certain string, based on its productions. Maybe I can map each non-terminal to a string and see if they match.\n\nWait, another approach: since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the string can be built up by recursively partitioning it.\n\nSo we can try to split the string into pairs recursively. Starting with the entire string, which is 10 symbols. 10 is even, so we can split it into two parts, each of length 5. Then, each of those can be split into two parts of length 2 or 3, but wait 5 is odd again, so perhaps some parts will be even and others not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be split into a sequence of productions.\n\nLet me try another method: consider the entire string and see which non-terminals can produce it.\n\nThe string is t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t3.\n\nNow, looking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first non-terminal is NT28, which \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 must generate the first part of the string, and NT17 the second part. Wait, that might not be the case because in CNF, each production produces strictly two symbols. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17, both must be expanded into strings that concatenate to the input.\n\nSo perhaps the idea is that the string is the concatenation of NT28's string and NT17's string.\n\nSo first, Nt28's production is NT17 NT7, which must produce part of the string, and NT17 must produce the remaining part.\n\nWait, actually, wait: S's production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the entire string should be the concatenation of the results of NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo the string is t3 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t3. Let's see if we can split it into two parts that could be generated by NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me try to see what's after that. Looking at the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 must produce a prefix, and NT17 must produce the suffix.\n\nSo perhaps I can try to split the string into two parts where the first part is generated by NT28 and the second by NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, maybe the first two symbols are t3 t2, so let's see if NT28 can produce that. But wait, NT28 is NT17 NT7. So, NT17 produces the first part and NT7 the second. So the full string is NT17's production concatenated with NT7's production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work from the leaves up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the string, let me see which production rule in the grammar exactly matches a certain part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals can directly produce a certain symbol.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n- NT58 \u2192 't3'\n- NT17 \u2192 't3' if using a production rule that ends with 't3', but wait, checking the rules, some of the non-terminals are replaced by terminal strings.\n\nFor example, looking for terminals:\nNT5 \u2192 't1', NT24 \u2192 't1', NT39 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, if any non-terminal produces a terminal, it's a leaf node in the parse tree.\n\nSo I can look for non-terminals that directly produce 't3', 't2', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, several non-terminals have a production to 't's.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at NT58: NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT23? No, that's not a terminal. Wait, let me check all the rules for NT17: NT17 has rules like NT17 \u2192 NT27 NT27, not helpful for terminals. Wait, looking through the rules, maybe NT17 can produce 't3' in some way?\n\nLooking through all non-terminals and their productions:\n\nFor example, NT5 is a non-terminal that has a production NT5 \u2192 't1'. So that's a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT10 \u2192 NT23 NT26, but I don't see a direct terminal there.\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, here are several non-terminals that produce terminals directly:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't1' (from NT53 \u2192 NT53 NT6, but no. Wait, for NT5 \u2192 't1'?)\n\nWait, in the list, NT48 \u2192 't23' \u2192 wait, no, perhaps I need to check if any non-terminals directly produce a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that have a production which includes a terminal symbol on the RHS. From the initial rules, I think that a non-terminal like NT5 might have a production where it appends a terminal.\n\nWait, let me parse it more carefully.\n\nLooking through the RHS of each rule:\n\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT17 (non-terminals)\n- NT57 \u2192 NT13 NT8 \u2192 Wait, right-hand side is NT13 and NT8, both non-terminals?\nWait, no. Let me look at each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules one by one:\n\n1. S -> NT28 NT17 \u2192 both are non-terminals.\n\n2. NT57 -> NT13 NT47 \u2192 both are non-terminals.\n\n3.

So, when parsing the string, I can check if each substring is generated by a production rule that leads to a terminal symbol step by step.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t4 t3 t2 t0 t0 t0 t3 t3 t5\n\nLet me check each position starting from the beginning.\n\n1. The first symbol is t0. Looking at the grammar, '0' is a terminal. So, which non-terminals produce '0'? Looking at the grammar, NT15, NT21, NT29, NT30, and NT0 produce 't0', 't4', 't5', 't3' respectively.\n\nWait, actually, no. Looking back, each production's right-hand side terminals are the ones I provided. Wait, actually, I think I need to correct that. Let me look again.\n\nIn the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions include various terminals. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11, and in the terminal list under NT27, it's 't1'. Similarly, NT15 is 't0', NT0 is 't5', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list out all the productions that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT58 produces t3 if 27 produces 't3' and 11 produces 't5'. But 27 produces 't1' according to the string provided? Or maybe I'm mixing up. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. The grammar has a set of non-terminals, and each production ends with some terminals. For example, some non-terminals produce a terminal directly:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't3' (Wait, looking for rules where RHS is a terminal)\n\nWait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't1'\n- NT33 \u2192 't3'\n- NT33 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, actually, none of these are directly producing the terminals in the string. Hmm, this might mean that it's an issue because the grammar as given doesn't have any terminals except in specific productions, meaning some rules produce single terminals, others produce combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to represent the grammar more clearly to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking again:\n\nIn the given grammar, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, the grammar's leaves (terminals) are the a's. For example, looking at each production:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't3' if 58 is a terminal. No, in the given grammar, NT58 is a non-terminal, and it's defined as NT27 NT11. Similarly, other non-terminals produce either other non-terminals or a terminal. So, perhaps the terminals are only present in the productions where a production ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

{"custom_id":"request-160","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string \"t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t2 t3 t3\" is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That should help in parsing or generating the string.\n\nNow, looking at the string, it consists of a sequence of terminals: t3, t0, t4, t5, t4, t3, t5, t0, t2, t3, t3. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so the challenge is to see if the grammar can produce such a sequence through some combination of the productions.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to trace back the string through the parse tree. Starting from the root symbol, which is S. Let's see the production for S:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nSo S expands into NT28 and NT17. Then each of these needs to expand further. Let me check what NT28 can do.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 splits into NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, NT17: checking the productions, there's NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, or NT17 \u2192 NT14 NT27, and another one NT17 \u2192 't5'. Hmm, I don't see a direct production for NT17. Wait, looking back at the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 't5' as one of its productions. That's good because 't5' is the last symbol in the string before the final 't3'.\n\nSo for NT17, we can have t5. So the first part of the string, up to t5, can correspond to S \u2192 NT28 (which is NT17 NT7) \u2192 t5 NT7.\n\nWait, but S is NT28 NT17. So after S expands to NT28 (which is NT17 NT7) and NT17, the entire S production would be NT17 NT7 NT17. So one NT17 is the first, and then the other is the second. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the entire string as the result of expanding S step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be derived from S by following the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe building the parse tree from the bottom up, starting with the terminals and seeing if we can reconstruct the non-terminals that can lead back to S.\n\nLet's attempt that.\n\nThe string is: t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t2 t3 t3\n\nI'll write it as a sequence:\n\n1. t3\n2. t0\n3. t4\n4. t5\n5. t4\n6. t3\n7. t5\n8. t0\n9. t2\n10. t3\n11. t3\n\nLooking at symbol 10: t3. In the grammar, is there a production for a terminal t3? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (so t5 is a terminal)\n- NT7 has a production NT7 \u2192 't3'?\nWait, let me check NT7's productions:\n\nYes, NT7 has several productions, one of which is NT7 \u2192 't3'. So t3 occurs at the end, at position 10.\n\nMoving up, symbol 10 is part of something that produced t3. Let's see, the last symbol is 't3', which must be the terminal from NT28. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nLooking at the S production: S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nIn NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. And NT17 can produce 't5' or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see the expansion tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nNow, let's see how NT28 and NT17 can expand. Let me look at the possible expansions.\n\nNT28 can expand as:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nWait, but NT28's production is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, right? So NT28 becomes NT17 NT7. Then, each of those NTs will be expanded further.\n\nSo the first NT28 becomes NT17, then NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 itself can expand to different things. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nor\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT14 NT27\n\nor\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5'\n\nSo, in our string, the last 't3' is from the NT17's expansion, but wait, no. Actually, earlier in the string, there's a 't5' at position 4, but position 10 has 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a series of terminals and see if they can be generated by the CFG using the productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string has 11 terminals. So the derivation would need to produce 11 terminals, meaning that during the expansion, the non-terminals must have broken down into the exact sequence of these terminals, possibly through multiple intermediate steps.\n\nLet me try to break down the string from the end.\n\nThe string ends with two 't3's: positions 10 and 11. So we have 't3 t3' at the end.\n\nLooking at the productions, which non-terminals can produce 't3'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT33 \u2192 't3' (since NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6, but let me check that. Wait, looking at NT33, it has two productions: NT33 \u2192 NT55 NT6 and NT33 \u2192 NT6 NT3. So NT33 can't directly produce 't3', but perhaps NT3 can.\n\nWait, looking for NT3's production:\n\nLooking through the productions, I saw that NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't3' (e.g., in NT3 \u2192 't3'), so NT3 can directly produce t3.\n\nAlso, NT7 \u2192 't3'.\n\nAdditionally, NT23 \u2192 't3' (since NT23 \u2192 NT4 NT1, but let's check the options for NT23.\n\nLooking up NT23's productions: NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, or NT23 \u2192 't5' ??? Wait, no, looking back, no, I think I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT23 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT23 has production NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41 and another production NT23 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no, I'm seeing that NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41 and NT23 \u2192 't5'? Let me check again.\n\nIn the list of productions under NT23, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41\n\nAnd\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT23's productions:\n\n- NT23 \u2192 NT51 NT27\n- NT23 \u2192 NT11 NT27\n- NT23 \u2192 NT38 NT11\n- NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41\n- NT23 \u2192 't5' ??? Wait, no, let me check the exact rules again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look carefully.\n\nIn the productions, under NT23, the rules are:\n\nNT23 -> NT7 NT41\n\nand others, but I don't see an NT23 \u2192 't3' production. So perhaps NT23 doesn't produce t3.\n\nWait, that may be a mistake because earlier, I thought NT33 had a production for 't3', but maybe that's incorrect. Let me check again.\n\nLooking for t3 as a terminal production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n\nNo others. So t3 comes from NT7 or NT3.\n\nNow, considering that the string ends with two 't3's, each must come from a NT7 or NT3. Let's assume that both are from NT7 or both from NT3.\n\nBut in our string, it's 't3 t3', so the last two symbols are produced by the same NT?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one comes from NT7 and the other from NT3, but that seems less likely because they are the same.\n\nWait, no, that's possible.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), it should have all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars can be parsed using algorithms like theCYK algorithm, but since this involves a string with multiple steps, I might need to work through the possible derivations step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar. Each non-terminal on the left side of the productions can produce two non-terminals. Some of these productions end in terminals, which are the 't's and 'n's here. My target string consists entirely of 't's, so I need to see how these 't's could have been derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, S starts by producing two non-terminals, NT28 and NT17. Let's break these down.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So, NT28 is NT17 and NT7. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try working backwards from the target string. Let's see which 't's correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string `t0 t0 t5 t3 t2 t6 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t5`, I can note the order of 't's and try to map which non-terminals they result from. For example, each 't' must come from a production of a non-terminal that directly produces that 't', like in the rules where NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9 and others end with 't's.\n\nI should list all the productions that end in terminals.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, wait. The grammar has some rules that produce terminals, and some that don't.

{"custom_id":"request-181","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see. The string is `t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should understand the grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF requires each production rule to have two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, it fits CNF because each rule on the left (like S, NT57, etc.) has exactly two symbols on the right, and some of these are terminals.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several production rules that lead to terminals 't0', 't1', 't2', 't3', 't4', 't5', and 't6'. Some rules convert to these terminals, like NT27 -> 't6', NT38 -> 't4', etc. So each production that ends in a terminal like 't' represents a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals that need to be expanded further.\n\nNow, the string consists of a sequence of these terminals: t3, t2, t0, etc. My approach should be to parse the string from left to right, trying to see if it can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S and see what it produces. The initial rule is S -> NT28 NT17. So S expands into two non-terminals: NT28 and NT17. \n\nNT28 has production NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Wait, let me check that rule again. Looking through the grammar, I see NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So NT28 expands into NT17 and NT7. Similarly, NT17 has two production options. One of them is NT17 -> 't3'. So if I take NT17 as part of the first expansion, it can directly become 't3'.\n\nSo starting with S, the first expansion is S -> NT28 NT17. Then, each non-terminal is expanded further. Let's try expanding NT28 first. NT28 can become NT17 NT7. Then, NT17 can be 't3', and NT7 has options like NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30 or others. Let's pick one path for NT7.\n\nLet's see, NT7 has production NT7 -> NT2 NT19 and NT7 -> NT13 NT30. Another option is NT7 -> NT4 NT48 or NT7 -> NT45 NT32 or some others. Hmm. Since our string starts with t3, which is handled by NT17 -> 't3', so if we take NT17 as 't3', then NT28 -> NT17 NT7 would be 't3' followed by whatever NT7 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the next token is t2, so after 't3', we expect to get a t2. But where does t2 come from? Let me trace.\n\nWait, our string is t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t3.\n\nSo after t3 (from NT17), the next should be t2. So NT7 must produce a 't2' in this case. Let me check what NT7 can expand into that gives 't2'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7 has a rule NT7 -> NT21 NT11. Another option is NT7 -> NT4 NT48. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT53 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT7 -> other options? Wait, let me check all.\n\nWait, the production for NT7 is:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nNT7 -> NT53 NT5\n\nSo, none of these directly produce a 't2'. Hmm, but perhaps these can expand into 't2' through further steps.\n\nWait, let me think. 't2' is generated by NT59? No, looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule that directly produces 't2' except NT32 -> 't2'. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided an extensive list of production rules. Let me look for any NT that directly produces 't2'. Scanning through:\n\n- NT32 -> 't2'\n\nSo NT32 becomes 't2'. So somehow, during expansion, we might reach NT32.\n\nSo the initial expansion S -> NT28 NT17. Then, after choosing NT17 as 't3', we need to have NT28 produce a sequence that starts with 't2'. So how can NT28 produce 't2'? Remember, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So in the first step, S gives us 't3' from NT17, then NT28 branches into NT17 and NT7.\n\nNT17 is already 't3', so we need NT7 to produce a 't2'. But looking at NT7 options, none produce 't2' directly. So perhaps I need to find a path where NT7 can eventually produce a 't2'.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to parse the string step by step, attempting to match each token and see if there's a derivation path.\n\nLet's denote the string as: [t3, t2, t0, t2, t0, t4, t3, t5, t3, t0, t0, t3]\n\nWe'll process each token, trying to see if each can be derived starting from S.\n\nStep 1: t3\n- Look at S: S -> NT28 NT17\n- NT17 can be 't3', so that's the first token. Then, we have NT28 left.\n\nSo now, after S, we have the production NT28. So next, we need to process the rest of the string with NT28 expanding into... Let's see, NT28 has rule NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 will expand into NT17 and NT7.\n\nNow, the next token after t3 is t2. So we need to process t2 using NT28's production. Let's see:\n\nAfter t3 (from NT17), we process NT28's NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nAfter expanding S into NT28 NT17, the string is t3 followed by everything else. Now, the NT28 and NT17 are to be expanded to produce the remaining tokens: t2, t0, t2, t0, t4, t3, t5, t3, t0, t0, t3.\n\nSo after t3, we have NT28 and NT17 left. But NT17 can be 't3', so that would take care of the next t3, but the actual next token is t2, not t3. So this approach seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Maybe the first expansion should be different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion of S is followed by a leftmost derivation. So we process the first symbol (t3) from S, and then expand S into NT28 NT17, and then process NT28 next.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as a parsing process, using a stack or something. Let me try that.\n\nLet's push S onto the stack. The string is t3 t2 t0 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t3 t0 t0 t3.\n\nCurrent stack: [S]\nTop of stack: S\n\nWe look at the first symbol in the string: t3.\n\nWhat productions start with S? Only S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nSo we push NT28 and NT17 onto the stack in reverse order. So stack becomes [S], but we process the production of S as NT28 NT17. So after popping S, we push NT17 and NT28.\n\nWait, in leftmost derivation, we replace the leftmost symbol each time. So after S, we take S's production NT28 NT17, and replace S with NT28 NT17. So now, the stack has NT28 and NT17. But we have consumed the first token t3, which came from NT17 -> t3.\n\nSo after processing the first token, the stack is NT28 and NT17.\n\nNow, the next symbol is t2. But the top of the stack is NT28. So we need to find a way for NT28 to produce a sequence that starts with t2.\n\nNT28 has production NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo we can push NT17 and NT7 onto the stack.

The string provided is `t5 t2 t4 t5 t4 t2 t4 t3 t5 t3 t0 t5 t3`, and I need to figure out if it can be derived from the grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have productions where each rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar doesn't have any such productions, but looking at it, it seems to be in a slightly different form, possibly left- or right-linear, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, actually, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, so yes, it is in Chomsky normal form.\n\nWait, looking closer, each production on the left is either a non-terminal A, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT28 NT17, which is A -> BC. Then NT7 -> NT2 NT19, which is another A -> BC. Looking further, there are terminals like 't3', 't5', etc. So all terminals are single symbols, and the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t5, t2, t4, etc. So each terminal in the string should correspond to the right-hand side of some production in the grammar.\n\nMy approach should be to see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the grammar's production rules. Essentially, working backwards, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string.\n\nBut the grammar is quite large, with many non-terminals. Maybe it's easier to parse the string from right to left, using a pushdown automaton approach, treating it as leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a top-down approach, applying productions step by step.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long, so it might be easier to process each terminal and see if it can be matched by some production's right-hand side.\n\nLet me consider each terminal and see if it can appear in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are 't3', 't5', 't4', etc. So perhaps 't5' is produced by some NT, 't2' by another, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I should list all the productions that have a terminal as the RHS. These are the only ones that can produce a terminal. For example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which doesn't produce a terminal. NT7 -> NT2 NT19, no. NT57 -> NT13 NT47, no.

All productions either lead to two non-terminals or have terminals mixed in. For example, some look like NT41 -> NT45 NT15, which is A -> BC. Another one, NT54 -> NT35 NT33, again A->BC.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, I see that some productions do have terminals, like in the initial list, e.g., NT7 -> NT2 NT19.

The string to evaluate is `t5 t1 t0 t0 t2 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production is either a two-symbol right-hand side or a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe grammar provided is quite extensive with multiple non-terminals, each producing other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals in the string are t5, t1, t0, t2, t3, t4, etc. So, I'll need to see if the string can be derived by following these productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t5 t1 t0 t0 t2 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3.\n\nLet me break down each terminal and see which non-terminals might produce them.\n\nI notice that some terminals like t5, t1, t0, etc., are terminals, so they must be the end of some productions. For example, t5 is produced by some grammar rule. Looking at the grammar, I see that there are rules where non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT58 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nNow, the parsing strategy. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or a CYK algorithm. However, since the string is small, I can try to traverse the string and see if each part can be derived from the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nLet's start by considering the entire string and working backwards. Alternatively, I can parse from left to right, as is common in recursive descent.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think in reverse, using the reverse of the grammar. That is, for the given string, we can check if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since each production has only two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right, maybe we can approach it step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. I need to find a production rule that produces t5 on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT27 NT17, but that's two non-terminals, so that's not helpful for t5.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5' \u2014 looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 is defined as NT1 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 't5'. So NT17 \u2192 t5. So, NT17 can produce t5.\n\nSimilarly, let's list all non-terminals that can produce a terminal in one step:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't5' \n- NT17 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 't4'?\nWait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41. Hmm, but where do the t1, t0, etc., come from.\n\nWait, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41, and looking at the right-hand side, perhaps NT19 and NT41 then produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if the string can be generated.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the start production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the first step is to evaluate NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 is replacing NT17 and NT7.\n\nTherefore, the first part is NT17, which we know produces t5, as NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, the first symbol t5 would be produced directly by NT17.\n\nNow, the second part from NT28 is NT7, which needs to produce the next symbols in the string.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string can be represented as a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps we can break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t1 t0 t0 t2 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3.\n\nLet me try to split it into parts that could correspond to the grammar.\n\nLet's see: Start with t5. As before, that can come from NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t1. Looking for a production that can generate t1.\n\nWait, I need to check if any non-terminal produces t1 as the leftmost symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly goes to t1. Hmm, that might be an issue. Did I miss any?\n\nWait, checking the grammar: The non-terminals are mostly transformed into other non-terminals, and only some produce terminals like t1, t0, etc.\n\nWait, in the production rules, are any of the non-terminals producing t1 directly?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (but that's for NT17)\n- NT7 \u2192 't4' or something?\nWait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal producing t1 on the RHS. That's a problem because the second symbol in the string is t1, so we need a production that starts with t1.\n\nWait, but maybe in the left part of a production. For example, maybe a non-terminal A can produce BC where B is t1, but that's two non-terminals, but in CNF, the RHS is two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is t5 t1 t0..., so t5 is first, then t1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to see if there's a way to produce t5 followed by t1 from S.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, that would be S \u2192 (NT17) (NT7) (NT17), but that would require NT7 NT17 to produce whatever NT7 and NT17 produce.\n\nBut NT17 produces t5, and NT7 we need to see what it can produce.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n- NT7 \u2192 NT20 NT26\n- NT7 \u2192 NT52 NT43\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce a terminal, so NT7 is built from two other non-terminals.

So, perhaps this path is not leading us anywhere, since we have to generate t5 and then t1, but the current approach (via NT28 and NT17) is giving us NT7, which doesn't directly produce t1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial production isn't S \u2192 NT28 NT17.

No, S is defined only as S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to reconstruct the entire parse tree. Wait, maybe the string can be built step by step.\n\nLet me try to see if the string starts with NT17 \u2192 t5, then NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so the next symbols should come from NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, NT17 is already producing 't5', so the next part is NT7.\n\nSo the string is t5 followed by ...

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The string provided is composed entirely of terminal symbols ('t0' to 't7'), so no non-terminals are present in the string. This means I should check if the string can be derived by starting from the start symbol (S) and applying productions that convert non-terminals into terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S -> NT28 NT17. So, I need to see if there's a path from NT28 and NT17 to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet's start by expanding NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\nNT7 has two possible productions: NT7 -> NT2 NT19 and NT7 -> NT13 NT30.\n\nWait, but the first step would be to expand NT28 and NT17 into their components, then see how they can be reduced to terminals. This seems a bit involved, but maybe I can represent this as a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can approach this from the right, trying to match the string from the start symbol and see if it can reduce to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the order of the terminals. The string is a series of 't's ending with t3 at the end. The grammar may have certain structures that can produce such a sequence.\n\nLooking at the productions, several non-terminals lead to 't' symbols. For example, NT52 -> 't2', NT32 -> 't1', NT17 -> 't5', NT9 -> 't3', and so on.\n\nBut let me step through it step by step. Starting from S.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nI need to break down NT28 and NT17 into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nSo S breaks down into NT28 NT17, which is NT17 NT7 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, that's not right. S is NT28 and NT17, so when expanding NT28, it becomes NT17 and NT7. So the breakdown is S -> NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, maybe I should think recursively.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5. Looking at NT28, it has a production that may lead to t5. NT28 can go to NT17 NT7, and NT7 can go to various things, including terminals.\n\nWait, looking at NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Let's see what these produce.\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\nNT58 -> NT1 NT15\nNT15 -> NT3 NT7\nWait, wait, no, looking back, NT58's production isn't directly given, but looking into the productions, I see NT58 -> NT27 NT11.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out the known terminals.\n\nWait, according to the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT33 -> NT55 NT6 is not terminal.

Wait, some of the productions go into terminals:\n\nLooking again:\n\nFor example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\nNT58 -> NT27 NT11\n\nWait, NT27 has a production: NT27 -> NT17 NT27 and also NT27 -> NT4 NT3.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should try to find a possible parse tree for the string.\n\nThe string is t5 t2 t3 t5 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3.\n\nLet me try to associate each 't' with a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT27 can produce t6, NT32 can produce t1, NT17 can produce t5, NT2 can produce t5, NT52 can produce t2.\n\nWait, I'm trying to map each 't' in the string to a non-terminal that can generate it.\n\nLet me attempt to construct a possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S -> NT28 NT17\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT58\n\nNow, the first part is NT17 NT7 NT17, but this might not be helpful. Maybe I need to expand differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to look for the sequence of symbols and see if they can follow the productions.\n\nWait, the string is t5 t2 t3 t5 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nt5, which could come from NT17 or NT2, as both seem to produce t5.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, NT17 can produce t5 via NT17 -> 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 can produce 't5'.\n\nSo perhaps the first symbol t5 comes from either NT17 or NT2.\n\nLet me pick NT17 first: t5 could come from NT17.\n\nNow, the remaining string after t5 is t2 t3 t5 t3 t0 t4 t1 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3.\n\nNext, after t5, we have t2. Looking at NT28's productions, NT28 can lead to 't2' via NT28 -> NT17 NT7, but wait NT28 is about NT28, not NT2.\n\nWait, no, NT28 is the non-terminal; its productions lead to other non-terminals. So perhaps I'm mixing symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list the possible non-terminals that can produce 't2' directly.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT52 -> 't2'\n\nSo if we have NT52, it produces t2.\n\nWait, but in the current breakdown, after S is NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not expanding correctly. Let me try to outline all the possible productions that result in terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are some rules that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT28 -> 't5'\n\nWait, no, I thought earlier that NT17 can produce 't5', and NT2 can produce 't5' as well.\n\nWait, looking back at the productions:\n\nNT28 has one production: NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 doesn't directly produce a terminal; its children are non-terminals or others.\n\nLooking through, let's list all productions where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\n- NT52 -> 't2' (I think that's correct; looking at NT52...

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and I can see it's in CNF because each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The terminals here are t0, t1, up to t5, and the non-terminals are S, NT followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to check consists of a series of t's. Since the grammar has only t0 to t5 as terminals, this string is composed of these, so potentially it's valid.\n\nMy approach will be to try to construct the string by working backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string through a series of productions. Alternatively, I might try to parse the string using the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the grammar for S is `S \u2192 NT28 NT17`. So, S starts with NT28 and NT17. That means the string must start with the symbols derived from NT28 and NT17. So the string begins with t5, which is NT28's terminal. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the productions for NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, the production for NT28 is `NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7`. So NT28 expands to NT17 and NT7. So the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 (NT17 NT7) (NT17). So the first part is NT17, which produces 't5', then NT7, then NT17 again, and so on.\n\nWait, let me structure this. The initial S production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 expands to NT17 NT7, and NT17 expands to 't5'. So S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17. But I think I should consider all possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t5 t2 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t5 t6 t5 t5 t0 t3 t5`.\n\nThis is 14 tokens long. Each production contributes some tokens, sometimes one or two.\n\nEach NT production eventually leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. Let me try to parse the string by looking for possible substrings.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Let's find the productions that produce t5. Looking at the grammar, I see NT52 \u2192 't2' and NT9 \u2192 't3', but I'm looking for t5. Checking all, I realize that NT29 \u2192 't5' and NT52 \u2192 't2', and some others don't seem to have t5 as a terminal. Wait, no, let me check all the 'a's in the grammar:\n\nLooking back, I see each production for NT is a combination, except some are terminals. For example:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT2 \u2192 't5'\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT6 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n\nOh, I missed NT0 \u2192 't5'. So NT0 and NT17 both produce 't5', as do NT2 and NT27. Hmm.\n\nThe string starts with t5. Let me see which NT's produce t5. So possible NT's are NT0, 2, 17, 27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for NT17, it's `NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58`. NT1 \u2192 't5' as well. So NT17 \u2192 't5' 't5'.\n\nSo the first two symbols t5 t2... Wait, no, the string is t5 followed by t2. Wait, no, the string is t5 t2. So if the first part is t5, then maybe NT17.\n\nWait, maybe I should start by working backwards. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must end with the entire string. Let me try to identify the last part of the string and see if it matches any production.\n\nThe last token is t5. The non-terminals that produce t5 include NT0, 17, 27, and perhaps others, but I think those are the main ones.\n\nLooking at the grammar for t5:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (since NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT1 \u2192 't5')\n- NT27 \u2192 't6' and 't5'? Wait, looking at NT27: `NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27` and `NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3`. So NT27 can produce 't6'? Or wait, let me check the productions for NT27.\n\nWait, looking back, for NT27: `NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27` and `NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3`. So how does NT27 derive terminals?\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT53 NT43. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me find all the productions for NT27.\n\nWait, the productions given are:\n\nNT27: \n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27\n- NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n\nSo to get a terminal, we need to have these expand further until they hit a terminal. Let's see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT53 NT43\n\nSo NT4 can be broken down. Similarly, NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, and so on.\n\nBut looking for t5 in NT27's productions: it seems that NT27 doesn't directly produce 't5' but may do so through further expansion.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't5' directly.\n\nWait, the string ends with t5. So the last symbol must come from an NT that produces t5. So possible options are NT0, 17, 27 (if it can produce t5 through expansion), or others that eventually lead to t5.\n\nLet me start by assuming that the last symbol comes from NT0 or NT17.\n\nCase 1: The last symbol comes from NT17.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' 't5' through the productions NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT1 \u2192 't5', NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11.\n\nSo NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11, which then needs to produce the remaining string.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting complicated. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t5 t2 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t5 t6 t5 t5 t0 t3 t5.\n\nLet me see the possible splits.\n\nLooking for the end symbols:\n\nIf the last symbol is t5, which can come from NT0, 17, or 27 (if it can produce t5). Let me consider NT17 first.\n\nBut NT17's expansion is NT1 NT58, which would produce 't5' and NT58's expansion. Let me see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 \u2192 't5' NT58.\n\nNow, NT58 \u2192 NT27 NT11.\n\nSo, to get t5 at the end, perhaps NT58 can produce t5 somehow. Wait, but NT27's productions lead to more non-terminals. Let me look at NT27's expansion:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3.\n\nSo NT4 \u2192 NT53 NT43.\n\nHmm, this seems like it could go on, but it's getting complicated. Maybe another approach is to list the possible parse trees or see if the string can be generated by the grammar through recursive derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each token in the string can be matched by some NT's possible expansion.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t5: possible NTs are 0, 17, 27,?\n\nWait, the given NT0 has production NT0 \u2192 't5', so t5 can be the terminal for NT0.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 \u2192 't5' 't5' via NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT1 \u2192 't5'.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I can split the string into parts and see if they correspond to the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, it might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable since the string is only 14 symbols long.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the positions where t5 appears"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-243","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string \"t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t6 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3\" is generated by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I remember that a CNF grammar has productions like A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals or terminals, but in this case, the left-hand side can sometimes be terminals. Wait, no, actually, CNF typically has productions that start with a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, some starting symbols might be terminals because when I see productions ending with things like NT7 -> 't3', those are terminal symbols. So the entire string is a sequence of these terminals, right?\n\nThe string is a space-separated sequence of t0, t1, etc., but in the grammar, the terminals are represented as 't3', 't5', etc. Wait, no, the string is written as \"t5 t3 t4 t3 t3...\". But looking at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't3', 't5', 't4'... So the string given uses 't's followed by numbers, which match the terminals.\n\nSo, the string is \"t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t6 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3\", which is a sequence of these terminal symbols. Each terminal corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nSince the given grammar is already in CNF, each production is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. Wait, no, some are terminals, some are two non-terminals. For example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which is two non-terminals. But for the given string, each symbol is a terminal, so each symbol must correspond to a production of a single non-terminal (or terminal) that produces that symbol.\n\nBut in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal, like NT29->'t5' or NT1->'t5'. So for each position in the string, we need to find a production that directly results in that terminal.\n\nWait, but the problem is to check if the string can be derived by the grammar. So each step in the derivation must produce the string by expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut in CNF, each production has either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string must be a sequence of terminals that can be produced by expanding the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nGiven the string is 15 symbols long, it's likely that the grammar can produce it, but let's check step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. S produces NT57 NT28. So the first step is S \u2192 NT57 NT28.\n\nNow, each of these NTs must produce the corresponding symbols in the string. The string starts with 't5', so either NT28 or NT57 must produce 't5', or we need to expand further.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, NT57 can produce 't5' or NT57 can be broken down. Looking at NT57's productions: NT57->NT19 NT9, and NT19 -> 't5', NT9->'t3', and other options. So expanding NT57, the first symbol 't5' can come from NT19 -> 't5' and NT9 -> 't3', so 't5' t3. But the string starts with 't5 t3', which matches the first two symbols if NT57 is 't5' and NT28 is 't3'.\n\nWait, no. The string is \"t5 t3...\". Wait, if S \u2192 NT57 NT28, then the first part is NT57 producing 't5' and NT28 producing 't3'. So 't5' and 't3' would be the first two symbols. That matches the first two symbols of the string.\n\nWait, but looking back, the string is \"t5 t3 t4 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t6 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t3\". So yes, the first two symbols are 't5' and 't3'. So we need to check if NT57 produces 't5' and NT28 produces 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT57's productions, it can directly produce 't5' as per the rule NT57->'t5'. So NT57 can become 't5'.\n\nNT28's productions: NT28->NT17 NT7. So to produce 't3', let's see if NT17 or NT7 can produce it. Looking at the grammar, NT17's production: NT17->'t5' or NT17->NT1 NT58. So if we take NT17->'t5', it can produce 't5', but we need 't3', so that's not it. Alternatively, maybe another path.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT28\u2192NT17 NT7, and we need NT28 to produce 't3'. So each of NT17 and NT7 must ultimately produce 't3' or other terminals.\n\nWait, but let's backtrack. If S produces NT57 NT28, and NT57 produces 't5' and NT28 must produce 't3', then NT28 must expand into a production that eventually results in 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT28's production: it only can produce two non-terminals: NT17 and NT7. So to get a terminal 't3', either NT17 or NT7 must directly produce 't3' or the combination leads to a 't3'.\n\nLooking at NT7: it has several productions: NT7->NT2 NT19, NT7->NT13 NT30, etc. But looking at the end of the string, the first symbols are 't5 t3', and we're trying to get NT28 to produce 't3'. So perhaps NT28\u2192NT17 NT7, and NT17 produces 't5', which would contradict, because we need 't3'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each symbol in the string is the result of a production step. So for example, if NT28 can produce 't3', then that would match. But in the grammar, NT28 only produces two non-terminals, so it doesn't directly produce a terminal. So we need to expand NT28 further.\n\nLet me see the productions for NT28:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo NT28 can only be broken down into NT17 and NT7, which themselves can be broken down further.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 has two productions: NT17\u2192't5' or NT17\u2192NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, but 't5' is a terminal, so if NT17 can produce 't5', but we need 't3' from NT28. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's consider the entire string and see if it's feasible.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the entire string as the sequence of terminals produced by the start symbol S starting from S, expanding it step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step either introduces a terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation corresponds to replacing a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nIn this case, the string is 15 symbols, which is an odd length, but in CNF, each production either introduces two symbols (non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. So when you expand, each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols (which can be terminals or more non-terminals). So the derivation trees would be binary trees, with each node having two children.\n\nBut since the string starts with 't5', that corresponds to a terminal symbol, which must directly come from a production that produces a single terminal. So let's think about which non-terminals can produce 't5'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1, NT26, NT53, etc., can all produce 't5' directly.\n\nWait, let me look at each production that has only one terminal:\n\n- NT1->'t5'\n- NT8->'t5' (Wait, no, according to the given grammar, NT8's production is NT43 NT47, etc. Let me check each rule ending with a terminal:\n\nLooking through the grammar, let me identify all non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal:\n\n- NT57->'t5' (Yes)\n- NT29->'t5' (Yes)\n- NT19->'t5' (Yes)\n- NT9->'t3' (Yes)\n- NT5->'t3'? No, looking at NT5: NT5\u2192NT43 NT24. So no.\n- NT43->'t3'?

{"custom_id":"request-242","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S, as seen in the rule S -> NT28 NT17. The string we're checking is: `t3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that certain production rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't3', NT20 -> 't4', and NT27 -> 't6'. These are terminal symbols we see in the string. The rest of the grammar rules produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo, first, I'll note that the string starts with 't3', which can be generated by NT17. Similarly, 't0' from NT36 if I'm correct, but wait, NT36 is part of the grammar, I think NT0 is a non-terminal with production rule NT0 -> 't5'? Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has NT0 -> NT51 NT46, but then NT51 -> NT1 NT53, and that seems to go on until NT0 -> 't5'. Hmm, looking at the provided grammar, the only rule that produces 't5' is NT30 -> NT15 NT30, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, at the end, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT51 NT46\nNT51 -> NT1 NT53\nNT53 -> NT12 NT23\nNT12 -> NT19 NT41\nNT41 -> NT45 NT15\nNT15 -> NT3 NT7\nNT3 -> NT19 NT35\nNT35 -> NT21 NT6\nNT6 -> NT4\nNT9 -> NT21 NT9\nNT29 -> NT21 NT9\nNT52 -> NT20 NT36\nNT36 -> 't4'\nNT20 -> 't4'\n\nWait, looking at NT36: NT36 -> 't4', so if NT36 is used, it can produce 't4'. Also, NT52 -> NT20 NT36, and NT20 -> 't4', NT36 -> 't4', so NT52 can produce 't4' 't4' via its productions.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT15: NT15 -> NT3 NT7. NT3 -> 't3', NT7 -> 't5', so 't3' 't5'. But in the string, we have 't5's, so NT0 can produce t5 if it's directly applicable.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by working backwards from the string, trying to see if each token can be generated by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3\n\nI'll try to see from the start symbol S.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo, S can produce a string where the first part is derived from NT28 and the second part from NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Let's see what NT28 produces. Since NT17 -> 't3', it's a terminal. So NT28's left side is 't3' and then NT7.\n\nNow, NT7 has multiple production rules. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT40 -> NT28 NT21, which can then lead to 't3' from NT28 and something else from NT21.\n\nBut let me make a tree.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nSo S can produce 't3' followed by NT17 (which is 't3') and then NT7.\n\nSo starting the string:\n\nt3 (from NT17) followed by more tokens.\n\nWait, no: Wait, S is NT28 followed by NT17, each of these produce a string on their own.\n\nSo S produces the concatenation of NT28's production and NT17's.\n\nBut let's look at NT17: NT17 -> 't3'. So the second part is fixed as 't3'. So S produces the first part from NT28 and the second as 't3'.\n\nSo the string starts with whatever NT28 produces, followed by 't3'. Looking at the string provided, it starts with t3 t0... So that would imply that NT28 must produce something that starts with t3, but wait, T28 is a non-terminal; when we expand it, the tokens come from its rules.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing production rules. Each non-terminal can expand into a sequence of tokens or other non-terminals. So the entire string is built by expanding S step by step.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to parse the string starting from S and see if it can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, maybe think about whether the given string has 't5' in it. Looking at the string, I see multiple 't5's.\n\nIn the grammar, certain non-terminals lead to 't5'. For example, NT15 -> NT3 NT7. NT3 -> 't3', NT7 -> 't5'. So NT15 can produce 't3 t5'. Similarly, NT35 -> NT21 NT6, and NT21 can produce various things, but perhaps this can end up with 't3 t5'.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, let's see where 't5' comes from. Maybe NT0 can produce a 't5' through some expansion.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 -> NT51 NT46\nNT51 -> NT1 NT53\nNT53 -> NT12 NT23\nNT12 -> NT19 NT41\nNT41 -> NT45 NT15\nNT15 -> NT3 NT7 -> 't3' 't5'\n\nSo NT53 -> NT12 NT23. NT12 is NT19 NT41, which is 't3' followed by NT41, which is NT45 NT15 -> then 't3' 't5' again.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Maybe working from the start, trying to generate a string.\n\nBut another approach: Let's see the string t3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3.\n\nEach token is a terminal, except for the non-terminals, but in this case, all are terminals except perhaps if a non-terminal is part of the string.\n\nWait, no, all the tokens in the string are terminals because in the provided grammar, each production on the right side is either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, the problem is that the string is a sequence of terminals, so each token in the string must be generated by a non-terminal rule.\n\nLooking at the first token, t3. Which rule in the grammar produces t3?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't3'\nNT15 -> 't3' (wait, no, NT15 is actually part of the rule: NT15 -> NT3 NT7. So NT3 is 't3', NT7 is 't5' (since NT7 can derive 't5'), so NT15 can produce 't3' 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 can derive 't5', maybe via some chain.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the 't3's in the string can come from NT17, while 't0's can come from NT0, perhaps? Or how?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there is NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT51 NT46\n\nAnd NT51 is NT1 NT53.\n\nSo perhaps NT0 can lead to t5 somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check for the presence of certain non-terminals that directly generate the tokens.\n\nLooking at the string: t3 t0 t0 t0 t4 t0 t4 t6 t5 t0 t5 t2 t3 t3 t3.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated from S by expanding each non-terminal into its productions.\n\nEach token is a terminal, so a non-terminal in the grammar must directly produce that terminal.\n\nThus, let's analyze each token:\n\n1. t3: can come from NT17 or maybe others. Looking at the rules: NT17 -> 't3', yes.\n\n2. t0: Looking at the grammar, NT30 -> 't4'? Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-262","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string to check is `t5 t5 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t0 t3 t5 t0`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Since this grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, which I suppose is the only non-terminal that needs to be considered. The productions from S go to NT28 and NT17. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with t5 or t3, which are terminals. Specifically, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Let me see the first symbol in the string: t5. So, perhaps NT28 is involved.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by using the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars to check parsing. The CYK algorithm involves building a table where each cell represents the possible non-terminals that can derive the substring of that row. \n\nThe string is of length 16, so the indices will go from t0 to t15. Let's number them 0 to 15 for convenience.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by initializing the table and filling it row by row, column by column.\n\nBut first, let me list all the productions that result in terminals. Since each non-terminal in CNF expands into two non-terminals or a terminal, we can collect all the productions that produce a terminal. That will help in the CYK table.\n\nFrom the grammar, the productions that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t3 (appears twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 t2\n- NT5 \u2192 t0\n- NT6 \u2192 t4\n- NT7 \u2192 t5 (three times)\n- NT8 \u2192 t1? Wait, checking: NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47. No, wait, NT8 is NT9 in the production above. Let me check: Wait, looking back, I see NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47, which are both non-terminals except looking at the end productions, perhaps I missed some. \n\nWait, in the grammar, after NT36, there's NT56 \u2192 't3', which is three, and NT47 \u2192 't5'. Hmm, maybe I should list all terminal productions.\n\nWait, no. The grammar is given, and the productions that derive terminals are the ones where the right-hand side is a single terminal. So looking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t2, t3, t4 (three times as it's used in multiple places, but each application gives a terminal).\n\nSimilarly, NT3 \u2192 t3, nt33 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, no\u2014look at the grammar:\n\nI see lines like NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, which are non-terminals. Then others like NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, NT7 \u2192 NT17 NT27. So NT7 is a non-terminal until it's resolved into a terminal.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: in Chomsky normal form, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So any production that ends with a terminal, like NT3 \u2192 t3, or NT4 \u2192 t2, etc., those are the ones that define a terminal production.\n\nWait, wait, looking again through the grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form has rules where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the productions except the terminals seem to fit that structure. So that's good because it should be easier to apply parsing techniques.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of six possible tokens: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6. Wait, in the provided grammar, I notice that some non-terminals like NT14, NT17, etc., correspond to specific terminals. For example, NT17 \u2192 't5' and NT27 \u2192 't6', and so on. It looks like certain non-terminals are mapped directly to terminals, which helps because when we parse, we can check for these terminal replacements.\n\nThe approach I think I should take is to work backwards from the string. That is, use the CYK algorithm. But since this is a human, let me see if I can manually build a parse tree or use memoization.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0 t0. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive the entire string. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT17 NT28. So S \u2192 NT17 NT28. Each of these NTs must derive a part of the string.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the possible terminals from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5'\n- NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT7\n\nSo, the first part, NT17, produces t5, and NT28 needs to produce something else. But in the string, the first two tokens are t0 t0, which doesn't start with t5. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT17 NT28.

So that would mean the string cannot be derived from S, right? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all possibilities. Maybe the NT28 can derive a longer sequence. Let me see: NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT7. So, NT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24.\n\nWait, that seems complex. Alternatively, maybe I should look for all possible ways the string can be broken down into terminals and see if they fit any of the NT productions.\n\nLooking at the string: t0 t0 t6 t5 t2 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t3 t5 t5 t3 t4 t3.\n\nFirst, t0 appears multiple times. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t0? Checking the end productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5' (Wait, no, NT0: let me check. Looking back, NT0: it seems like the last line says NT0 \u2192 't5', but I don't see NT0 being produced by anything else.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT29 \u2192 't5' and NT43 \u2192 't2', but I don't see any NT producing t0. Wait, let me check all the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see lines like NT53 \u2192 't2', NT58 \u2192 't1', etc., but nowhere does an NT produce 't0' except perhaps in the case of NT0: the last line I see is:\n\n\"NT0 -> 't5'\"\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me re-check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the list, I see several lines:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT52 \u2192 't2'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT38 \u2192 't4'\n- NT57 \u2192 't3'\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5' \n\nWait, so in the provided grammar, NT0 \u2192 't5'. Hmm, that's confusing because the string has t0 t0. So none of the non-terminals directly produce t0 except for NT0, but NT0 only produces 't5', not t0. So that would mean t0 cannot be derived from any non-terminal. That would imply that the string cannot be generated by the grammar, since the string starts with t0.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, is there any non-terminal that produces t0? Looking again, I don't see any except maybe NT12 or NTsomething else.

The string is `t3 t0 t4 t2 t0 t4 t3 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t4 t5 t2 t4 t5`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar produces. CNF means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. It's important because it allows for efficient parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but here since I'm just determining derivation, I'll do it step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminals are defined to produce either pairs of non-terminals or specific terminals. My goal is to see if this grammar can derive the given string.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S. The rule for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S needs to split into NT28 and NT17. Each of these needs to be derived into their components.\n\nLooking at NT28, its rule is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 splits into NT17 and NT7. NT17's rule is NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. So, NT17 splits into NT1 and NT58.\n\nContinuing with NT58, the rule is NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15. NT1's rule is NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41. Wait, that's a bit circular. Let me note down the steps.\n\nBut maybe it's better to approach this by breaking down the entire string and seeing if it can be matched.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t3 t0 t4 t2 t0 t4 t3 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t4 t5 t2 t4 t5.\n\nEach terminal corresponds to a production rule. Let's see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have rules that end in terminals:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (but 43 and 24 are non-terminals)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21 (17 leads to t5, 21 to t0)\n- NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10 (54 is non-terminal, 10 is non-terminal)\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 (43 is non-terminal, 36 is non-terminal)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (same as above)\n- NT7 produces t3 or t4 or something else\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals that can directly produce terminals.\n\nLet me look through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT1 NT15 (both non-terminals)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (both non-terminals)\n- NT8 \u2192 NT43 NT47 (both non-terminals)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT20 (both non-terminals)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21 (17 \u2192 t5, 21 \u2192 t0)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41 (both non-terminals)\n- NT2 \u2192 NT32 NT9 (32 non-terminal, 9 non-terminal)\n- NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 (both non-terminals)\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36 (non-terminals)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30 (both options produce non-terminals)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21 (17\u2192t5, 21\u2192t0)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT52 NT26 (non-terminals)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43 (non-terminals)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 or NT4 NT3 (but 17 is t5, 4 \u2192 t2, 3 is t3)\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should map each terminal to non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLet's list which non-terminals can produce each terminal:\n\n- t0: from NT10 via NT10 \u2192 NT17 NT21. Since NT17 \u2192 t5, NT21 \u2192 t0.\n- t1: Not directly in the given grammar. Wait, looking, NT6 is t4, NT9 is t3, NT15 is t0, NT17 is t5, etc. But wait, do any non-terminals produce t1? Looking through the rules, I don't see any. The original grammar doesn't have t1 terminal. Hmm, that's odd because the given string has several 't1's. Let me check the grammar again to see if it's correctly presented. Oh, in the initial list, the grammar production seems to have some lines cut, as some symbols produce t0, t3, etc., but in fact, the last line \"end your response\" suggests they might have been truncated.\n\nWait, let me go back. The given grammar's last few lines are:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55\n\nWait, no, perhaps the user missed some parts. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can produce t1. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 or NT4 NT3. Since 17\u2192t5, 4\u2192t2, 3\u2192t3. So 27 produces sequences but does it produce t1? No, t1 is not in the terminals here.\n\nLooking, t1 is not present in the grammar's terminal productions. So the string has 't1's, but if the grammar doesn't have any non-terminal that produces t1, then any occurrence of 't1' in the string would make it impossible to derive.\n\nLooking at the string provided: the string is `t3 t0 t4 t2 t0 t4 t3 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t4 t5 t2 t4 t5`. I count two 't1's in the string. If the grammar doesn't have any non-terminals that produce t1, then the string cannot be derived from the grammar. So the presence of 't1's would immediately make the answer 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, does any non-terminal produce t1? Let's see:\n\nNT27 is defined as NT4 NT3, which are t2 and t3. NT12 is defined as NT19 NT41, which are t3 and t5. NT24 is NT53 NT43, both of which I don't see producing t1. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me scan all:\n\n- NT27: 4 and 3 \u2192 t2 and t3\n- NT12: 19 and 41 \u2192 t3 and t5\n- NT24: 53 and 43\n- NT23: 7 and 41 \u2192 t5 and t2\n- NT13: 1 and 7\n- NT57: 28 and 47 \u2192 28 is non-terminal, 47 could produce t5\n- NT7: 2 and 19 \u2192 t2 and t3\n- Wait, perhaps NT27 can produce t27? Wait, no, the non-terminals only produce sequences, not the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Did any non-terminal produce t1? Because if none do, the string has 't1's, which can't be derived.\n\nLet me look at each line in the grammar:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3: produces t2 and t3.\nNT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41: t3 and t5.\nNT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43: 53 is NT53, which is non-terminal, and 43 is another non-terminal.\nWait, perhaps NT11 is somewhere. Let me check the lines.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46\nNT11 \u2192 NT0 NT43\nNT11 \u2192 NT21 NT9\nNT11 \u2192 NT39 NT24\nSo 11 produces 26 and 46, both non-terminals. No t1.\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce t1: It seems none of the non-terminals have a production that includes a terminal with t1. So 't1' does not appear in the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't1's, which cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar. Hence, the grammar cannot generate the string, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string provided is a sequence of terminals: `t3 t5 t5 t5 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5`. I need to check if this sequence can be generated by the start symbol S.\n\nTo do this, I'll perform a backward parse. That is, I'll start from the end of the string and try to find the corresponding productions. The process involves checking if the string can be represented as a series of these productions.\n\nLet me list out all the terminal symbols and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, I can list the productions that produce each terminal:\n\n- t0: Looking at the rules, I see NT29 \u2192 t5, NT30 \u2192 t4 and t3, NT27 \u2192 t6, NT33 \u2192 t3 or t6, NT35 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, no, actually, the terminals are defined as direct productions ending with a terminal. So, for example, NT17 \u2192 't3', meaning it generates t3. Similarly, others like NT20 \u2192 't4', NT2 \u2192 't5', and so on.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that directly produces that terminal. So, my first step is to map each 't' symbol in the string to the non-terminals that produce it.\n\nLet me list each 't' in the string and find possible non-terminals that produce them:\n\nt3: NT17, NT3, NT54, NT41, NT51, NT0, NT27, NT53, etc.\n\nt5: NT29, NT20, NT2, NT30, NT35, etc.\n\nt5 appears multiple times, so NT29, NT20, NT2, etc.\n\nt5 again, same as above.\n\nSo for each 't', I can have multiple possibilities. This will complicate things because I have to consider all possible combinations.\n\nBut since there are multiple paths, it's better to approach this methodically. Let me try to traverse the string from the end, trying to match the productions.\n\nSo, the string is: t3 t5 t5 t5 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5.\n\nLet me reverse the string to make parsing easier, so from the end: t5 t4 t0 t3 t5 t2 t4 t5 t6 t2 t0 t3 t5 t5 t5 t3.\n\nWait, no, reversing is not necessary. It's just that I need to go step by step from the end.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to split the string into individual tokens for clarity:\n\nt3, t5, t5, t5, t2, t3, t0, t4, t5, t4, t2, t6, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5.\n\nSo, that's 17 tokens.\n\nNow, starting from the left, I'll try to match the productions. Alternatively, perhaps a bottom-up approach with the parse table would be better, but since the problem is small, maybe a step-by-step approach would suffice.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first token is t3. Looking for a non-terminal that produces t3.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT17 \u2192 t3. So the first part of the string could be derived from NT17.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t3 from NT17. Now, moving to the next tokens.\n\nThe next token is t5. Now, from NT17, the production is NT17 \u2192 t3. So that's a single token, and the next token is t5, which can be produced by several non-terminals like NT20, NT2, NT29, etc.\n\nWait, but NT17 \u2192 t3, so each time, the rule for NT17 just produces a single terminal. So after the first t3, the next symbol should also be a single production.\n\nWait, but the next token is t5, which must be produced by a non-terminal that itself has a production for t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals directly produce t5.\n\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT29, but S is the start symbol, which is a combination of two non-terminals. So the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try to build the parse tree.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to map each token to the non-terminals and see if the entire string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent parser approach would help, but since I have to do this manually, let me try a different strategy.\n\nLet me try to write the string as a sequence and see if I can split it into the required productions.\n\nLet me write the string:\n\nt3, t5, t5, t5, t2, t3, t0, t4, t5, t4, t2, t6, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5.\n\nSo, 17 tokens. Let me see if each token can be generated by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking for the first token: t3. As before, possible NTs are NT17, NT27, etc. But in this case, let's assume it's NT17 \u2192 t3.\n\nNow, moving to the next token: t5. The next production would have to take the current symbol and produce t5. But NT17 only produces t3, so after producing t3, the next token must be something that can produce t5. Wait, but that's not correct because each token is a single production. So, for example, after NT17 \u2192 t3, the next part must be a non-terminal that can produce t5. But the problem is that the string is a single sequence, not a combination. So, perhaps I should consider that each token is a direct production from a non-terminal.\n\nThis might not make sense because in the string, each 't' is a single terminal symbol produced by a non-terminal. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar must derive the entire string from the start symbol using the rules.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT29. So the start is two non-terminals. The string is a concatenation of their productions.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire string is derived from S as a two-part expansion. Let me think about the structure.\n\nLet me consider that the string starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT29, so the first part is NT28, and the next is NT29.\n\nSo, let me try to parse the string as NT28 producing the first half and NT29 producing the second half, but that might not be accurate because NT28 and NT29 could be part of a larger derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps each production step is a leftmost derivation. So, starting with S, replace the leftmost symbol at each step.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, I need to find a way to match each part with the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should perform a forward parse, trying to break down the string into the non-terminals.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nThe string is: t3, t5, t5, t5, t2, t3, t0, t4, t5, t4, t2, t6, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals can produce these terms.\n\nStarting with the first token, t3, which can be from NT17, for example.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t3, as I thought. Now, moving to the next token, which is t5.\n\nNow, since NT17 only produces t3, I must have followed a production that includes NT17 somewhere before. But wait, that might not be the case. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each part as a combination of non-terminals. Since S \u2192 NT28 NT29, the entire string must be derived from these two non-terminals.\n\nSo the first part is NT28 and the second part is NT29.\n\nLet me see if I can parse the first"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a chain of non-terminals before a terminal. Each rule is left and right parenthesized, which helps in parsing, but for determining if a string is generated, I probably don't need to parse it with a parser but instead simulate the process.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, it's rewritten as NT28 NT17. So the first step is that the entire string must be rewritten from S. Each rule produces two parts, so the string must be broken down into these parts without any leftover symbols.\n\nThe string has 18 symbols, all of which are terminals (t0-t5). So each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal or come from a production rule that eventually leads to terminals.\n\nLet's start by looking at the grammar rules. The first rule is S -> NT28 NT17. So the string must start with what NT28 and NT17 generate.\n\nLooking at NT28: Its rule is NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Wait, but NT17 has a rule that leads to 't5'. So NT17 is directly a terminal when replaced by 't5'. Similarly, NT28 will produce 't5' followed by what NT7 produces.\n\nNT7 has multiple productions. Let's see which one applies. NT7 can be NT2 NT19, which eventually might lead to 't5', or NT13 NT30, which could go into a longer chain, or NT4 NT48, etc. We'll need to see which path gets us to the necessary terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: The first four symbols are t5 t5 t5 t5. So starting from S, the first part is NT28, which is t5, and the second part is NT17, which is also t5. That aligns with the first two t5s. Let's see if this holds.\n\nSo NT28 gives t5, which is the first t5. Then NT17 gives another t5, making two t5s so far in the string. But the string has four t5s at the beginning. Hmm, maybe I need to go deeper into the grammar to see how more t5s can be produced.\n\nLooking at NT28, it's NT17 NT7. NT17 is t5, so NT7 must produce three more t5s. Let's see how NT7 can be broken down to get t5, t5, t5.\n\nNT7 can produce several combinations. Let's check:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19: NT2 is NT27, which has a rule producing t6. Doesn't help here.\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30: NT13 is NT1, which has a rule that can lead to t5 or t4. NT30 is NT3, which is t3. So that might not help.\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48: NT4 is t2, NT48 is NT48 producing NT20 NT14. Wait, NT20 is 't4', and NT14 is NT14 -> NT5 NT9, which are t2 and t3. So that gives t4 followed by t2 t3, but that's not t5.\n- Another NT7 production is NT13 NT30: Wait, I already checked that. Maybe NT7's other rules?\n\nLooking at other rules for NT7: Wait, is there a production I missed? Let me scan again.\n\nWait, in the list, NT7 has:\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nNT7 -> NT5 -> NT4 NT48?\n\nNo, wait, the rules are:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nNT7 -> NT58\n\nWait, no, looking back: There's another NT7 -> NT4 NT48. So NT7 can also be NT4 NT48, which is t2 and then NT48.\n\nWait, in the initial breakdown, NT28 is NT17 NT7. So after NT17 (t5), NT7 produces something that, when combined, gives t5. So for the remaining three t5s after the first one, we need NT7 to produce t5 three times.\n\nLet's see the options for NT7:\n\nLooking at NT7's rules:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT2 NT19: NT2 is NT27, which can be t6. Not useful.\n2. NT7 -> NT13 NT30: NT13 is NT1, which could lead to t5, and NT30 is NT3, which is t3. So that could give us t5 t3, not t5.\n3. NT7 -> NT4 NT48: NT4 is t2, and NT48 is NT48 -> NT20 NT14. NT20 is t4, and NT14 is NT14 -> NT5 NT9, which is t2 t3. So NT48 would give t2 t4 t2 t3. That's more than t5. Not helpful.\n4. Another NT7 rule is NT7 -> NT58, but I don't see that in the initial list. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see: For NT7, the options are NT2 NT19, NT13 NT30, NT4 NT48, and another NT7 -> NT58? Or is that a typo?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe initial list of rules includes:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nAnd then, I don't see another NT7 production. So maybe it's missing. Wait, perhaps the initial list I provided is incomplete. Let me check the original question again.\n\nIn the given grammar, the rules for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nNT7 -> NT57-> NT5->?\n\nWait, no, I think I misread earlier. Wait, in the given rules, perhaps there is another NT7: Let me check.\n\nLooking again at the initial rules:\n\nHere are the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\n\nAnd also, wait, did I miss any? It seems like only three rules under NT7. Hmm, but in the initial grammar, in the provided rules, it doesn't show NT7 -> NT58. So perhaps it's a mistake in the parsing, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the initial rules provided, I should check each line:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT7 appears in multiple places, but the user only showed some. Wait, the lines go up to NT6, then NT8, etc. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, looking again, the initial rules don't include an NT7 -> NT58. So perhaps it's another production, but it's not listed. That might be an issue. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo or omission.\n\nAssuming that only the three productions I listed are available, then NT7 cannot produce a t5 from that point unless another path is considered. Hmm, that's a problem because with the current rules, NT7 can't produce t5 on its own. Because the only way NT7 can produce a terminal is if one of the components in its production rule leads to a t5.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn NT7 -> NT2 NT19, NT27 is t6, so that's not helpful.\n\nIn NT7 -> NT13 NT30: NT13 can become t5, and NT30 is t3. So NT13 produces t5, and then NT30 is t3, so altogether that would produce t5 t3, not t5. To get three t5s, perhaps that's not the way.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 -> NT4 NT48 gives t2 from NT4 and then NT48, which may produce more t5s. But NT48 -> NT20 NT14, which is t4 and then NT14->NT5 and NT9, which are t2 and t3. So that would be t2 t4 t2 t3, not t5s.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Maybe the string has multiple t5s, so NT28 needs to produce t5 followed by NT17, which is t5, and then other parts. But the initial breakdown seems to be giving two t5s, but the string has four t5s.

Looking at the start symbol, S production is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the string starts with NT28 and NT17, which should translate to t0 in the string. Wait, looking at the mappings, NT17 \u2192 't5', so S \u2192 t0 t5?\n\nWait, let me check the mappings. The productions include NT17 \u2192 't5', right? So S starts with NT28 and NT17. Looking at NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Then NT7 has several productions. One of them is NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, and another is NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t6 t5.\n\nI think the parsing should consume each token step by step, applying the productions.\n\nLet's consider the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first two tokens should be the results of NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (from NT28's production). So first, NT28 generates NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky normal form, each step is a production to two non-terminals, right? So S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, when we expand NT28, it becomes NT17 NT7. So starting off, the string starts with t0 (from NT17), then comes from NT28's NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a parse tree. Let me see:\n\nS \u21d2 NT28 NT17 \u21d2 (NT17 NT7) NT17.\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process, keeping track of the current non-terminal and the position in the string.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t6 t5.\n\nI think I'll process the string token by token, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17. So we need to expand NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So now, S becomes (NT17 NT7) NT17.\n\nWait, no. The initial expansion is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So we write NT28 and NT17 as the two parts. Now, we need to expand each. Let's process NT28 first.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So now, S expands to NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, the first token is t0. According to NT17's productions: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, or other options. But in the string, after t0, the next token is t0, which is another NT17? Or is it another NT? Let me check: the string is t0 t0 t3... So the first token from S's first part is t0 (NT17), but we're starting from NT28, which is part of S.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to track the parse stack or use a recursive descent approach, but perhaps with a top-down approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the possible sequences. Let's see: the first token t0 must come from either NT17 or another non-terminal that can produce t0. Looking back, NT11 \u2192 NT0 NT43 and NT0 \u2192 't5'. But earlier, NT15 \u2192 't0', and several others produce t0.\n\nWait, let me check the mappings again:\n\nLooking at the productions, NT15 \u2192 't0', so perhaps NT15 is an intermediate that can produce t0. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't5', but that's not t0. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, there are productions like NT15 \u2192 't0', so NT15 can produce t0. Similarly, NT41 \u2192 't2', and others.\n\nWait, but in the mapping, for example, the production NT5 \u2192 't2' appears. Wait, no: looking at the list, I see:\n\nFor example, NT15 \u2192 't0', NT11 \u2192 't2', etc.\n\nSo in the string, the first t0 probably comes from NT15.\n\nWait, but let's get back to the initial step. S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nThe first token is t0, which should be either NT28's expansion or NT17's.\n\nLooking at NT28's production, it's NT17 NT7. So when we expand NT28, we get two non-terminals: NT17 and NT7. So the first token after expanding S would be NT17.\n\nWait, no. Wait, maybe the parse is leftmost. So S expands to NT28 NT17. The first symbol to process is NT28, which then expands to NT17 NT7.\n\nSo then, the processed tokens so far would be NT17 (which is t0) and NT7. So the string so far is t0, and we have to process NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's look at the entire string and the possible sequences that can produce it.\n\nThe string is: t0 t0 t3 t3 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t3 t6 t5 t3 t0 t4 t6 t5.\n\nLet me list all the tokens:\n\n1. t0\n2. t0\n3. t3\n4. t3\n5. t4\n6. t2\n7. t3\n8. t0\n9. t4\n10. t2\n11. t3\n12. t6\n13. t5\n14. t3\n15. t0\n16. t4\n17. t6\n18. t5\n\nNow, let's try to break them down step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Let's expand NT28:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo after expanding, we have NT17 and NT7. So the string starts with NT17, which should generate t0. So token 1 is t0, which matches.\n\nNow, we have the next part: NT7.\n\nNT7 has multiple productions: NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, etc. Let's see which one matches.\n\nLooking at the first token after t0, we have another t0, which is the second token. Let's look for a way to get t0.\n\nWait, perhaps after NT28 (which is NT17 and NT7), we have to expand NT7 to produce the second t0. So let's check if NT7 can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT7, I don't see any direct production to t0. The productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT53 NT5\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t0. So perhaps the second t0 comes from another part.\n\nWait, maybe after NT28, which is NT17 and NT7, the first t0 is from NT17, and NT7 produces something else, but then later on, maybe there's another NT that can produce t0. But looking at the string, it's t0 t0, so both are t0. If the second t0 isn't from NT7, then perhaps NT7 is expanded into something else that can produce t0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's look again.\n\nWait, maybe the first NT7 in the expansion of S can produce t0 via some productions. Let me check the NT7 productions again.\n\nWait, looking at NT7's productions, none of them directly produce t0, unless I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nThe productions for NT7 are:\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

This seems a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a string generated by a CFG means that there's a derivation path from the start symbol (in this case, S) to the string, replacing non-terminals according to the production rules until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which first produces NT28 and NT17. Each of these is a non-terminal. I need to see how these can expand into the given string.\n\nLet me start by looking at how S can lead to the start of the string.\n\n1. S -> NT28 NT17\n   So, the string starts with NT28 followed by NT17.\n\n2. I need to see what NT28 and NT17 can produce. Let me follow the productions for NT28 and NT17.\n\nNT28 can produce NT17 and NT7. Let's see what NT17 can do.\n\nNT17 has productions:\n- NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n- NT17 -> NT27 NT27\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a production NT17 -> 't5' which is a terminal. So, the string could end with 't5'. Also, it can split into NT1 NT58.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't4'. But NT28 can go to 't4' via NT40 or NT24, but in the given grammar, I think I need to see each non-terminal's possible terminals.\n\nLooking back, let me check all non-terminals and their terminal productions.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal:\n\n- NT5 -> NT43 NT24\n- Not terminal.\n\n- NT7: Two productions:\n   - NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n   - NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n   Also, NT9 -> NT15 NT20; NT29 -> NT0 NT36, etc. I think I should focus on NT28, NT17, NT2, etc., as these seem to appear in the start's production.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to build the parse tree starting from the start symbol and see if it can derive the string. Alternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to see if each symbol in the string can be produced by the corresponding non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string: t4 t3 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t6 t1 t3 t3 t3 t5\n\nSo, 20 tokens. I'll index them from 0 to 19.\n\nI think the most straightforward way is to perform a leftmost derivation, trying to match each symbol step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\n   The first symbol is t4 (index 0). We need to see if NT28 can produce t4.\n\n   Looking at NT28's productions:\n\n   NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\n   NT17 can also go to NT17's terminal or non-terminal. Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n   NT17 has three productions:\n\n   - NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n   - NT17 -> NT27 NT27\n   - NT17 -> 't5'\n\n   Wait, the third production is NT17 -> 't5', which means it can produce 't5' directly.\n\n   Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't4'. So if the first part is 't4', which non-terminal can produce that?\n\nLooking again, perhaps I made a mistake. In the initial production, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first non-terminal is NT28.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions: NT28 can be replaced by NT17 NT7 or others? Wait, in the given grammar, the relevant productions for NT28 are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT40 NT13\n- NT28 -> NT14 NT33\n\nWait, yes, looking again:\n\nThe grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\nNT57 -> ...\n...\nNT28 has multiple productions:\n- NT40 -> NT28 NT21\nSo wait, let me check all productions for NT28:\n\nNT28 appears in:\n- S \u2192 NT28 NT17\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT28 \u2192 NT40 NT13\n- NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production list, for NT28:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 (appears in NT40's production as NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21)\nWait, no, wait NT40 is a separate non-terminal. Its production is NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21.\n\nSo, for NT28, directly, it has production NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and there's another production where NT40 produces NT28 NT21, but that's not relevant for NT28 directly. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing NT28 and NT40.\n\nYes, NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21, so NT28 is a part of NT40's production. But for NT28 itself, its own productions are:\n\nFrom Ntsn's own productions:\n\nLooking through the list, the relevant NT28 productions are:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\n- Also, in the production for NT28, I need to check if any other production has NT28 as left-hand side.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT44 \u2192 NT40 NT8\n\nBut that's for NT44, not NT28. Hmm, I think I need to list all the productions for each non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to list all the NT28 productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT21, which is a production for NT40, so it's irrelevant for NT28.\n\nWait, I think that's the only production for NT28 as a starting point. So NT28 can only be NT17 NT7. So from NT28, the only way is to replace it with NT17 and NT7.\n\nBut then, how does the string start with 't4'?\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nBut the options for NT28 are:\n\nLooking again, the grammar has:\n\n- NT28:\n   - NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n   - Also, maybe in the production for NT14: wait, no, looking again, the productions under NT28 are only NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe I got the productions wrong.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, it's:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that start with NT28:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nI don't see any other productions for NT28. So the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which becomes NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first step is S \u2192 NT28 followed by NT17, meaning during leftmost derivation, the first symbol comes from NT28, and the next comes from NT17.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is 't4', which must come from NT28.\n\nBut from NT28's production, it's only NT17 NT7. Which suggests that NT28 is replaced by NT17 and NT7, but 't4' is not produced by any of these.\n\nWait, this means I must be making a mistake. Because if S \u2192 NT28 NT17, and NT28 can only be replaced by NT17 NT7, then the first symbol in the string should come from NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, no, because during leftmost derivation, we first replace the leftmost non-terminal.\n\nSo after S \u2192 NT28 NT17, the next step is to expand NT28. If NT28 can only go to NT17 NT7, then we replace NT28 with NT17 and NT7. So the string so far would start with NT17 and NT7.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbol is 't4', which is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-319","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5\". The instructions say to use any reasoning strategy I want, so I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, or a terminal. The given grammar has a bunch of rules, and the start symbol is S, which starts as S -> NT28 NT17. The string consists of several t symbols and NT numbers, so I need to see how these can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs can produce terminals directly, such as NT27 -> 't6', NT7 -> 't3' (from NT17 production), etc. So the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into these terminals and if the structure follows the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that most of the symbols are t3 or t5, except a few like t2, t0, t4. But from the grammar, t5 is a terminal from NT5, NT52: NT5 -> NT29 NT54, which can produce t29 and t54. Wait, but looking at the definitions:\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9->NT15 NT20, which then can go to t0 or t2, etc. Hmm, maybe I should look at how the terminals are produced.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are things like 't3', 't5', 't4', 't2', 't1', 't0'. The NTs that can produce these are:\n\n- NT27 -> 't6' (but t6 isn't in the string)\n- NT17 -> 't5' via NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and NT58 can produce other NTs. Wait, the problem statement shows that NT17 -> NT1 NT58, and NT58 -> NT27 NT11. Let's parse this.\n\nWait, the key is to see how 't3' and 't5' can be produced.\n\nLooking at the start symbol:\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo the string must start with NT28 -> ... and NT17 -> ...\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Then NT17 could be 't5' or more rules. If NT17 goes to 't5' directly, that's one way.\n\nWait, let's see the productions for NT17: NT17 -> NT1 NT58. So NT17 can't directly produce 't5'. Let's check NT58. NT58 -> NT27 NT11. Then NT27 -> 't6', which isn't in the string, or is it? No, the string has 't3' and 't5's but not 't6's. So maybe that path isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's see:\n\nWait, the problem statement gave the NT7 -> NT2 NT19, and NT27-> NT17 NT27. Wait, perhaps I need to see deeper.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of each part of the string and see how it can be built up.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3, t5, t5, t3, t2, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5, t5, t3, t5, t5, t0, t4, t5, t4, t5.\n\nSo each step should break into part of this string. The grammar is in CNF, so each step could split the NT into two NTs or a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to parse the string using the grammar, seeing if each part can be matched.\n\nWait, but given the time, maybe it's easier to see that all the symbols in the string are t3, t5, t2, t0, t4, which are all present as terminals. So perhaps the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I can see how each terminal can be obtained.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- t2: nt24-> NT24 -> NT21 NT43. NT21: NT21-> NT35 NT2. NT35-> NT21NT6. NT6 can split into NT53-> NT3 NT56, etc., eventually leading to t3 or other terminals. Wait, but maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider each token in the string and see if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's list the tokens:\n\nt3, t5, t5, t3, t2, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5, t5, t3, t5, t5, t0, t4, t5, t4, t5.\n\nSo for each of these:\n\n- t3: is a terminal. Which NT can produce 't3'? Looking at the grammar, it seems NT27->'t6' (no), NT17-> 't5' (no), NT58->'t27' which is not 't3'. Wait, no: looking at NT17 -> NT1 NT58. NT1 is NT1-> NT58 NT41. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, let Nt7's rules.\n\nWait, wait. Let's look for NTs that produce t3:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't5', which is one token. Another place is 'NT53-> NT44 NT21', which, when you expand further, may lead to 't3's.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see that 't3' can come from NT58: NT58->NT27 NT11. NT27-> 't6' (which is not in our string), or NT27 can split into 't6', which again isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for rules that directly produce 't3'.\n\nLooking at the grammar at the very end, there's NT17 -> NT1 NT58, and NT58 can be expanded further. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT17-> NT1 NT58\n\n- NT58 -> NT27 NT11\n\nSo NT58 splits into NT27 (which could split further) and NT11.\n\nLooking at NT27:\n\n- NT27-> 't6' or NT17 NT27.\n\nHmm, if NT27-> 't6', but our string doesn't have any 't6's, so this might not be useful. Alternatively, NT27 could split into 't6', which is present nowhere. So perhaps that path isn't used.\n\nBut then, wait: In the grammar, 't3' is produced by NT58?\n\nNo, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: start with the given string and see if it can be broken down step by step into the grammar's productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt3 t5 t5 t3 t2 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t5 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5.\n\nThe total length is 19 tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for the string S will have a depth equal to the number of tokens.\n\nLet me attempt to parse this string using the grammar.\n\nStarting with S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nSo the string starts with whatever NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT28:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nThen NT17 is as before.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I can use a top-down parsing approach.\n\nAlternatively, think about the string as a sequence of t's and NTs, and see if the grammar can derive it.\n\nAnother idea: the string has 10 t5s, 4 t3s, 2 t2s, 2 t0s, 2 t4s, and no other terms.\n\nSo perhaps all these t's are at the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nSo the task is to see whether, for each production in the grammar, the given string can be split into a sequence of symbols that the grammar's rules can derive.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe stepping through the string step by step.\n\nLet me start with the entire string and see if the root, S, can split it into two parts that each can be generated by NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo the string S must produce S1 S2, where S1 and S2 are derived from NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into two equal parts (since in a two-step grammar in CNF, each step splits into two). Wait, actually, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, but the actual split"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

CNF CFGs produce strings with exactly one non-terminal at each step except for the final terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to understand the structure. Let's look at the given productions:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which directly produces NT28 NT17. Each non-terminal on the left side of the productions eventually breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the top-level production:\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17\n\nNow, let's see what NT28 and NT17 produce. \n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT7\u2192 NT2 NT19 or NT13 NT30\n\nWait, there are multiple productions for NT7. So, the parsing might require backtracking or considering all possible branches.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of \"t\" symbols and some specific numbers: t5, t3, t3, t6, t0, t4, t5.\n\nLet me note down all the terminal symbols in the string: t5, five times, then t5 again, etc. The string starts with t5 fourteen times, followed by t3 twice, t5, t6, t2, t0, t4, t5.\n\nI know that each terminal symbol must correspond to a production rule that directly gives that terminal. So, I need to check which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals like t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, etc. For example:\n\nFrom the productions:\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\nNT5 \u2192 't5' (Wait, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, some of the top-level productions end with terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\nNT6 \u2192 't4' (Wait, no, looking more carefully: actually, some of these non-terminals do produce terminals.

The string is \"t3 t5 t0 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t5 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t5 t3 t0 t3 t5 t3 t5\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar produces. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 t, where A, B, C are non-terminals and t is a terminal. The start symbol is S, which eventually needs to derive the entire string using these productions.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol, S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the string starts with NT28 and NT17. The string begins with t3, so I need to see what NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nLooking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 produces two non-terminals, NT17 and NT7. The first part of the string is t3, which should match the terminal from NT28. Wait, NT28 is supposed to derive something that starts with NT17 and NT7. Let me check what NT28's production is again. Yes, it's NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.

But more importantly, the first token in the string is t3, so let's see what NT28 can produce.\n\nWait, actually, the productions for NT28 say NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So the first part of the string (the first t3) must come from NT17 and NT7. Let me look at the productions for NT17. Oh, NT17 has a production NT17 \u2192 NT58 NT11 and another NT17 \u2192 1t5. Wait, the user might have mistyped some, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's rule for NT17 is:\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\nNT17 -> NT27 NT27\nWait, no, that's not correct.

{"custom_id":"request-359","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t2 t3 t6 t1 t0 t3 t5 t4 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5`. Wow, that's quite a long string. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, yes, all productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good, CNF!\n\nIn CNF, the way to parse a string is to count the number of symbols, because each symbol requires exactly one production that is either terminals or non-terminals that can be replaced. For each non-terminal, it takes two steps (split and produce), so each symbol adds two to the parse steps. But wait, actually, that might not directly help here.\n\nAlternatively, the key point is that for a grammar in CNF, any string generated must have a length of 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied. Wait, no, actually, that's for the number of nodes in the parse tree. The length of the string is related to the number of productions, but it's more about the number of steps. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, no. For a CFG in CNF, the maximum length of any string is 2^n, where n is the number of non-terminals in the start symbol's initial productions. Or perhaps it's different. Let me think again.\n\nEach production either adds one terminal or splits a non-terminal into two, which can then be further split. So, for a string of length L, we need L - 1 splits. Because each split increases the count by one. So L must be equal to the number of non-terminal splits plus one. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, in a CFG in CNF, the maximum length of a string derivable from a non-terminal A is equal to 2^k, where k is the number of non-terminals in A's productions. Hmm, maybe I should look at the start symbol and see how many symbols are at the leaves.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S -> NT28 NT17. Both NT28 and NT17 can be further expanded. Let me check how each of these non-terminals can be expanded. Each of them has their own productions.\n\nFor example, NT28 -> NT17 NT7, and NT17 -> NT1 NT58. Each time, they might produce more non-terminals, but ultimately there are terminal symbols like 't0', 't1', etc.\n\nGiven the string provided, it's all terminals: `t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t2 t3 t6 t1 t0 t3 t5 t4 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5`. So each symbol in the string must come from some terminal production in the grammar.\n\nNow, I need to see if the number of symbols in the string minus one (since each production can produce at most two new symbols) fits the rules of the grammar. Let's count the number of symbols: from t0 to the last t5, that's 21 symbols. So the string has 21 terminals.\n\nIn a CFG in CNF, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to 2^n, where n is the number of levels of derivation. So 21 isn't a power of two. The nearest powers are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). Since 21 isn't a power of two, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar in CNF. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. Let me think again. Actually, the number of symbols isn't necessarily a power of two because the derivation doesn't have to fully expand all non-terminals at each step. Some non-terminals might produce terminals directly, so the string length doesn't have to be strictly a power of two. Hmm, so maybe that reasoning isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at how the symbols can be generated. For instance, starting from S, each step doubles the length or converts non-terminals to terminals. But it's possible that some non-terminals produce terminals directly, so the string length can vary more widely.\n\nLet me try another approach. Looking at the string, it's `t0 t0 t4 t3 t5 t2 t3 t6 t1 t0 t3 t5 t4 t1 t3 t3 t5 t3 t3 t3 t5`. That's 21 symbols. Now, each time a non-terminal is expanded, it can produce either a terminal or two non-terminals. If a non-terminal produces two non-terminals, each of those can produce another two or a terminal, etc. So the number of symbols can vary, but if we have to derive it, perhaps the binary representation of the string can be mapped back through the grammar.\n\nAnother way is to consider the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be built by expanding S step by step. However, with 21 symbols, it's tedious to do manually, so perhaps using the Chomsky-Sch\u00fctzenberger theorem or some other method, but that might be beyond my current capacity.\n\nWait, perhaps each symbol in the string comes from a unique path in the grammar. Since all symbols are t_i and the grammar has certain productions mapping non-terminals to combinations of other non-terminals or terminals, I might need to check whether each symbol in the string can be produced by some path in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce specific terminals. For example, NT2 -> t5, NT17 -> t5, NT27 -> t1, etc. So if the string has t0, that would have to come from some NT that expands to t0.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't0'. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the production rules again. Hmm, maybe none of the non-terminals directly produce 't0'. For example, NT2 -> t5, which is correct. Where does 't0' come from?\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, every production ends in some NT or a terminal. But I don't see any NT directly mapping to 't0'. That's a problem because the string has 't0' as the second symbol. If the grammar doesn't have any NT that produces 't0', then the string cannot be generated, and the answer would be No.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed looking at some rules. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see NT0 -> 't5'. So NT0 produces 't5', but nowhere does any NT produce 't0'. So that's an issue. Because the string starts with t0 t0... etc., but since no NT produces 't0', the string cannot exist in the language. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, most of the productions indeed follow this structure. The terminals (like t3, t4, etc.) are single characters. So, each rule produces either a pair of non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S directly produces NT28 and NT17. Therefore, the string must start with the sequence of symbols that NT28 and NT17 produce.\n\nLet me break this down. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (from NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7).

From the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58, and NT58 \u2192 NT4 NT30 (from NT58 \u2192 NT43 NT47? Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking back, I think I might be making a mistake here.

Then later, \"NT17 -> NT1 NT58\".\n\nWait, but in the current list of grammar, I don't see another rule for NT17 beyond that. Let me scan the entire list:\n\nLooking for NT17, I see:\n\n- NT17 -> NT1 NT58\n\n- Also, checking other lines, I don't see another rule for NT17. So perhaps NT17 has only one production: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there was another production, but maybe I was wrong. So the production for NT17 is only NT1 followed by NT58.\n\nSo, stepping back, the expansion for S is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which then becomes NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, and so on.\n\nBut to get started, let's map this out.\n\nThe string starts with t4. So t4 must be generated by a terminal rule. Wait, perhaps looking at the grammar, NT2 might produce t5. Let me check.\n\nLooking for NT2 rules.

Let me check.\n\nWait, another line says \"NT2 \u2192 CT1 NT43 NT15\", but that's possibly a typo. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the lines:\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\nNT20 -> NT23 NT26\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33\n...and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Instead, let me focus on the start symbol S and see how it can produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to approach this by trying to parse the string step by step, using the grammar, starting from the start symbol and trying to match each terminal in the string.\n\nThe string is: t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t0 t4 t5 t0 t4 t5 t6 t1 t0 t0 t3 t3 t6 t3.\n\nI need to find an expansion path starting from S that produces this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see whether the string is properly formed according to the grammar by checking each symbol step by step.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, every production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the derivation of the string would consist of a sequence of steps where each step either consumes a terminal or applies a non-terminal production.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, symbol by symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which must produce NT28 NT17 as per the rule S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nSo, the first expansion is:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, NT28 is defined as NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 becomes NT17 NT7.\n\nNow, the derivation becomes:\n\nS \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, the first symbol in the string is t4, which must be matched by one of the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t4? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I find that NT4: Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nI see:\n\n- \"NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36\"\n- \"NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24\"\n- NT24 \u2192 NT11 NT44, etc.\n\nWait, I don't see NT4 \u2192 t4. Or perhaps in another line: Checking again.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me check each production.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19.\n\nNT2 could be producing t5? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT2: I see \"NT2 \u2192 NT54 NT10\", but there's no direct production where NT2 \u2192 t5. Alternatively, perhaps in another part.\n\nLooking more carefully, \"NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT1\". Wait, NT27 is another non-terminal that might produce 't3' or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first t4 comes from some non-terminal, say NT4 \u2192 t4. Let me see.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that have a rule ending in t4. Wait, for example, does any NT produce t4?\n\nLooking through the lines, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\n\nWait, but that's a production of NT4 to two non-terminals, which doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some productions. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nAh, wait, I see: \"NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36.\"\n\nWait, that's all for NT4. So, NT4 can only produce other non-terminals, but does not produce a terminal directly.\n\nSimilarly, checking other non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, maybe NT17 produces t5 or something, but earlier I thought NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think about the rightmost symbols and see if they can be derived first.\n\nWait, maybe using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just trying to determine if the string is generated, perhaps it's better to try to construct an expansion sequence.\n\nWait, another approach is to look for any non-terminals in the string that don't match any production.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, so any string generated must start with S's productions. From the given grammar, S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So, the string must start with the expansions of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me write down the entire string with spaces: t3 t0 t4 t4 t5 t2 t2 t0 t4 t3 t0 t6 t5 t3 t5 t4 t5 t4 t2 t1 t3 t5.\n\nI notice that the terminals are 't's with numbers, and each 't' likely corresponds to a specific production. The grammar has several NTs (non-terminals) and some NTs produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NTs, many of them produce other NTs, but some produce terminals. For example, NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9, but also NT57 \u2192 NT19 NT9? Wait, actually, looking back, I see that NT57 has two productions: NT57-> NT19 NT9 and NT57-> NT13 NT30. Hmm, I need to check each NT to see if they produce terminals.\n\nWait, actually, some NTs produce terminals directly. For example, looking at the end productions:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't3'\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\nNT5 \u2192 't4'\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\nNT38 \u2192 't4'\nNT41 \u2192 't15' which seems like it should be 't15' but since we're only dealing with 't' terminals, maybe NT41 produces 't5' due to NT15 being 't0'? Wait, no, let's look again.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For instance:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't3'\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT6 \u2192 't4'\nNT9 \u2192 't3'\nNT5 \u2192 't4'\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\nNT38 \u2192 't4'\n\nThese are the only NTs that produce terminals. The rest produce other non-terminals.\n\nSo the string includes several terminals, so each terminal must correspond to an NT's terminal production.\n\nLet me see: The string starts with 't3', which is NT17's production. So the first part must be derived from NT17.\n\nLooking back at the start symbol: S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first part of the string should come from NT28, and the second from NT17.\n\nBut NT17 \u2192 't3', so the first terminal 't3' must come from NT17. Let me verify that.\n\nWait, S starts with NT28 and NT17. So the entire string must start with the symbols generated by NT28 and NT17. Since the string starts with t3 (from NT17), that's correct.\n\nSo after NT17's 't3', the next part must come from NT28.\n\nNow, let's look at NT28. From the grammar, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So NT28 generates two non-terminals: NT17 and NT7.\n\nNT17 is already handled, but NT7 must be expanded. Looking at NT7's productions: NT7 can go to NT4 NT48, NT13 NT30, or NT2 NT19.\n\nSo let's see. After the first t3, we have t0. So the next symbol is 't0', which must come from NT7.\n\nWait, NT7 \u2192 't0'? Let me check NT7's productions:\n\nLooking back, NT7 has:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nNone of these directly produce 't0'. But wait, do any of the NTs produce 't0'? Looking back at the grammar, yes: NT21 \u2192 't0'.\n\nSo to get 't0', NT21 must be somewhere in the derivation. Therefore, after NT7 generates some non-terminals, one of them must be NT21, which then produces 't0'.\n\nWait, but in the string after 't3', the next symbol is 't0'. So perhaps the expansion of NT7 must generate 't0' as the next terminal. Therefore, perhaps NT7 leads to NT21 somehow, which then produces 't0'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the expansion of NT7, one of the non-terminals leads to a path that results in 't0'.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial part is 't3 t0', which is NT17 (t3) followed by NT7 (which should expand to something that eventually gives 't0').\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nLet's see if any of these can eventually produce 't0'. For 't0', NT21 is an NT that produces 't0'. So perhaps one of the options leads to NT21.\n\nLooking at NT2: NT2 \u2192 't5', but in the grammar, NT2 is defined as NT2 \u2192 't5'. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the grammar's NT2 is:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. Looking through the grammar, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck the grammar rules for NT2, NT4, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'? Let me find the lines with NT2.\n\nYes, near the end: NT2 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 \u2192 't2', NT5 \u2192 't4', N0 \u2192 't5', NT21 \u2192 't0', NT27 \u2192 't6', NT38 \u2192 't4'.\n\nSo, let's correct those:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\nNT5 \u2192 't4'\nNT0 \u2192 't5'\nNT21 \u2192 't0'\nNT27 \u2192 't6'\nNT38 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo, back to NT7. If NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, and NT2 is 't5', that can't produce 't0'. But if NT19 then produces something else, maybe NT19 leads to another NT that can produce 't0'.\n\nWait, let me check NT19. Looking in the grammar for NT19.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\nI see NT19 in the production of NT17: NT17 \u2192 't3' is direct, and in other rules. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar:\n\nDo any NTs produce 19 as a terminal? Wait, no. Because the only terminal productions are for NTs like 2,4,5, etc. So NT19 is a non-terminal, meaning it doesn't produce a terminal. Only the other NTs like 2,4,5, etc., do.\n\nTherefore, if NT7 expands via NT2 NT19, the 't5' comes from NT2, and then NT19 is another non-terminal that must be expanded further.\n\nSo perhaps in this case, the first two symbols are 't3 t0', which corresponds to NT17 (t3) and then NT7 expanding to something that eventually gives 't0'.\n\nBut wait, 't0' comes from NT21. So maybe the expansion after NT7 must reach NT21. So perhaps NT7 \u2192 NT21 via some production.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions again:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\n\nNone of these directly produce NT21. So NT7 must expand to produce NT21 somewhere down the line.\n\nFor example, if NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, and then NT13 expands to something else, which eventually leads to NT21.\n\nWait, let me check NT13.\n\nLooking for NT13's productions:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7\nNT13 \u2192 NT14 NT43\n\nSo NT13 can go to NT1 NT7 or NT14 NT43.\n\nIf NT13 \u2192 NT1 NT7, then that would produce two non-terminals again, and we might be in a loop without getting to NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3`. Hmm, first, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, except for the start symbol which might produce nothing. But here, looking at some of the productions, like S -> NT28 NT17 and others, it seems each non-terminal produces exactly two other non-terminals. \n\nEach production is a binary expansion, so for a string of length n, the derivation tree should have depth related to log2(n) or something like that. Let me count the tokens in the string. It looks like there are 21 tokens (t's and numbers), so the length is 21. Since the grammar is in CNF, a string of length 21 would require 20 productions because each production adds one token (since you start with one, S, and each step replaces one non-terminal with two, but here the count is a bit different because 't's are leaves, not non-terminals). Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about how the derivation tree relates to the number of tokens. The number of symbols in the string corresponds to the number of terminal symbols, and each step doubles the number of non-terminals. Maybe it's better to trace the string step by step.\n\nLet me look at the example string: it starts with t3, which probably comes from a production that terminates. So I should find which productions of non-terminals can result in t3, t5, etc. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT7 -> t3 or t5, or t4, etc. Wait, actually no, some non-terminals like NT7 have productions that go to t5 or t3, but others like NT44 have productions that go to other non-terminals. Hmm.\n\nWait, I need to check the grammar for terminals. At the end of the grammar, some rules are like \u2192 t3, t5, etc. For example, look at the productions:\n\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT30 -> 't3' (probably)\n- NT20 -> 't4'\n- NT1 -> 't58 NT41' \u2192 wait, that's a non-terminal, so not a terminal. Hmm. Because 't's are leaves, I think, the productions must have a path that eventually leads to a production that produces a terminal.\n\nLet me think. Each non-terminal must eventually derive into a terminal, otherwise, the grammar can't generate a string with that non-terminal. So, first, I need to check if every non-terminal in the string can derive all the way down to terminals without any cycles or undefined paths.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3. From the grammar, I need to see which non-terminals produce 't3'. Looking through the rules, I notice that some have \u2192 't3'. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't3'\n- NT43 -> 't2' (wait, no, it's \u2192 't2'). NT3 -> 't3'.\n\nSo, 't3' can come from NT7, which has multiple productions, or NT3, etc. The key is that 't3' must be reachable from the start symbol S, and each step must correctly derive towards it.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step, considering each token and which non-terminals can derive to it.\n\nThe string is: t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3 t4 t3.\n\nWait, but the string has 21 tokens, which is an odd number, but 21 is not a power of 2, so it's not clear. Maybe I should use a recursive descent approach to see if each token can be derived from some non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can create a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce this string. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So S expands to NT28 and NT17. Each of these must produce the first token and the rest, or split further.\n\nBut from the string, the first token is t3, so if S expands to NT28 \u2192 t3, then the rest would come from NT17.\n\nBut looking at NT28's productions:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT28 \u2192 NT7 NT28 (cyclic? No, because it goes to NT7, which might be different)\n- NT28 \u2192 NT44 NT13\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t3, which comes from NT7 as in NT17 \u2192 NT... Wait, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals can derive t3.\n\nWait, let's list out which non-terminals produce t3:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only ones that produce t3 are:\n\n- NT3: NT2 \u2192 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no. Let's check each production:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't3'? Wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the production rules for generating terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3', 't5'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT27 \u2192 't6'? No, NT27 is NT17 NT27: Wait, looking again.\n\nWait, the production for NT27 is NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 and NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3. So, NT27 can go to a terminal or further.\n\nLooking for where the terminals are in the grammar, perhaps:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't5', one of its productions.\n- NT54 \u2192 't3'\n- NT29 \u2192 't5'\n- NT30 \u2192 't4', 't3'?\n- NT3 \u2192 NT6, which produces 't4'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT48 \u2192 't1'\n- Wait, let me go through all the production rules that result in a terminal.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't3', 't13 NT30' no, 't2 NT19' no, 't13 NT30' no, 't4 nt48' no, 't2 nt19' no, 't19 nt9' no. So only NT7 \u2192 t3, t5.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\nNT7 \u2192 NT53 NT5\nNT7 \u2192 NT27 NT11\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48 (again)\n\nWait, no, hold on. The actual productions for NT7 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are 5 productions for NT7:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n2. NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n3. NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n4. NT7 -> NT27 NT11\n5. NT7 -> NT53 NT5\n\nWait, so none of them directly produce 't3' or 't5'? That can't be right. Because in the string, the first token is t3, which must have a production in the grammar that allows it. But from the given rules, NT7 only produces non-terminals. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the initial analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, looking back: in the end of the grammar, several non-terminals have terminals:\n\n- NT29 -> 't5'\nWait, no, looking again, the productions:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT29 \u2192 't5' (yes)\n- NT30 \u2192 't4'\n- NT30 \u2192 't3'\n- NT20 \u2192 't4'\n- NT1 \u2192 't58 NT41'\n- NT51 \u2192 't7 NT4'\n\nWait, NT29 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, NT29 is defined as NT5 NT53, and NT53 is defined as NT6 NT56, and so on. But then, looking through the productions, NT29 has a production to t5. Similarly, NT30 has productions including \u2192 t4 and \u2192 t3. NT30 is defined in multiple ways, including NT4 NT3, which is a terminal because NT4 can produce terms, but looking:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT36, which are non-terminals, which in turn may produce 't2'. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled.

The string is `t3 t2 t2 t5 t0 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t5 t5 t3 t0 t4 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all the productions here start with a single non-terminal on the LHS, and their RHSs are either two non-terminals or sometimes a terminal, this fits the CNF structure.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals, so we need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S. The first step is to check if the entire string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which production is S -> NT28 NT17. Each of NT28 and NT17 has their own productions. I think it's helpful to build a parse tree or use a method like dynamic programming to check derivations.\n\nBut since the grammar is quite extensive, perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, ensuring each part of the string aligns with the possible productions.\n\nThe string is t3, t2, t2, t5, t0, t0, t4, t5, t0, t0, t3, t1, t5, t5, t3, t0, t4, t0, t4, t3, t3, t0, t3.\n\nEach of these must be part of the RHSs of the productions. Since we're dealing with a leftmost derivation, each step should replace the leftmost non-terminal with its RHS.\n\nStarting with S, let's see what S can produce: S -> NT28 NT17 (the only production). So the first two symbols must be derivations of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t3. So I need to see if t3 can be derived from NT28 or NT17.\n\nLooking at NT28's productions, one of them is NT28 -> NT7 NT28. Wait, that's a recursive production, meaning NT28 can produce a sequence where it is followed by NT7. Another production is NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Let's see if the first two symbols match.\n\nIn the string, after t3, the next is t2. Hmm. Wait, S -> NT28 NT17, so the first step is to produce NT28 and NT17. Let's see what NT28 can produce. The production NT28 -> NT7 NT28 could lead to a recursive structure, but perhaps it's easier to see if any direct productions of NT28 match the initial t3.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT28's productions, I don't see any production that directly starts with t3. Wait, let me list all NT28 productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT21\nWait, no: looking back, the productions:\n\nWait the grammar provided starts with S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nLooking through NT28, I see:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT21\nWait, let me check all NT28 productions:\n\nOh wait, looking back, I think I missed some.\n\nLooking through the productions, for NT28, it's written as:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT7 NT21\nNT28 -> NT33 NT3\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33\nNT28 -> NT44 NT10\nWait, no, looking back, I might have made a mistake. Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nHere's a part I see:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT7 NT21\nWait, another one: looking at the list again, I think there's more.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT7 NT21\nAlso, another: NT28 -> NT33 NT3\nAnd another: NT28 -> NT14 NT33\nAnd another: NT28 -> NT44 NT10\nWait, no, more precisely, the grammar as provided includes multiple NT28 productions? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, reviewing the grammar:\n\nThe list starts with S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nThen, further down:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\nNT28 -> NT7 NT21\nNT28 -> NT14 NT33\nNT28 -> NT44 NT10\nNT28 -> NT7 NT30\nWait, no, actually, checking each NT28 production:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT21\n- NT28 -> NT44 NT10\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT30\n- NT28 -> NT14 NT33\n- NT28 -> NT44 NT10\n\nWait, no, looking again, the list shows:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT21\n- NT28 -> NT33 NT3\n- NT28 -> NT14 NT33\n- NT28 -> NT44 NT10\n- NT28 -> NT7 NT30\n- NT28 -> NT14 NT33 (duplicate?)\nNo, each of these seems to be separate.\n\nSo, the RHSs for NT28 are combinations of two NTs, some of which have terminals. So for the first step, S produces NT28 NT17, so we need to see how NT28 and NT17 can derive the given string.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t3, so perhaps the first symbol t3 comes from NT28 or NT17. Since S replaces into NT28 and NT17, the first two symbols in the string are the results of NT28 and NT17 derivations.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t3, which is a terminal, so that must come from one of NT28 or NT17. Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\n\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58\nNT17 -> NT17 NT7\nNT17 -> 't3' (look for that)\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT17, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't3' \n\nYes, one of the productions is NT17 -> 't3'. So that means NT17 can directly produce t3. Therefore, the first symbol in the string can come from NT17. \n\nSo, in the first step of derivation, S -> NT28 NT17. Now, NT17 can be immediately replaced with t3.\n\nNow, the remaining part of the string after t3 is t2, t2, t5, t0, t0, t4, t5, t0, t0, t3, t1, t5, t5, t3, t0, t4, t0, t4, t3, t3, t0, t3.\n\nThis means that the NT28 must derive the remaining string. So, the problem reduces to whether NT28 can derive t2 t2 t5 t0 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t3 t1 t5 t5 t3 t0 t4 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3.\n\nWait, but NT28's first production is to other NTs. So, how do the terminals start appearing? Only through recursive steps or via productions that include terminals.\n\nLooking back at NT28's productions, the only direct terminal is in the production NT28 -> 't3'? Wait, no, checking NT28's productions:\n\nWait no, looking again, the NT28 productions don't have any terminals except in another NT, which might in turn produce a terminal.\n\nWait, wait, for example, looking at NT28:\n\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7\nBut NT7 can produce 't3'? Let me check NT7's productions.\n\nFrom earlier, NT7 has several productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> 't3'\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- etc.\n\nYes, there's a NT7 -> 't3' production. So, perhaps through multiple steps, NT28 can derive t3.\n\nBut the first symbol after t3 is t2, then t2, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let's take a better approach.

The string is `t5 t2 t0 t0 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t1 t5`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right side or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should parse the grammar to understand how it's structured. The start symbol is S, and the productions go up from S to more specific non-terminals, ending in terminals like t0 to t5. Each rule has two symbols on the right, which fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals: t5, t2, t0 repeated multiple times, and so on. Now, in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, each step of the derivation increases the length of the string by one. Therefore, the number of steps in the derivation is related to the number of symbols in the string.\n\nLet's see: the initial start symbol S will produce two non-terminals, then each of those can produce two more, and so on. The number of symbols in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of times we can split the string into pairs.\n\nWait, let's count the string length. The given string has 24 symbols, so 2^k =24? But 2^4=16, 2^5=32. 24 isn't a power of two, which is an issue because each step in the grammar doubles the number of symbols. So if the string isn't length 2^k, it can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count can vary because of the specifics of the grammar. But in most cases, for a string to be generated by a CNF grammar, its length must be a power of two because each step replaces a symbol with two, so the length goes from 1 (S) to 2, then 4, 8, etc. So for a string of length N, N must be 2^k for some k. \n\nChecking the string length: 24 is not a power of two. 2^4=16, 2^5=32. So if the string is of length 24, which is not a power of two, it can't be generated by this grammar. \n\nSo, without even looking at the exact string or the grammar, the string length tells me it's impossible. Let me count the symbols again to be sure. The string is `t5 t2 t0 t0 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t2 t4 t5 t3 t0 t0 t0 t3 t2 t3 t0 t4 t5 t1 t5`. Let's count: 24 tokens. Yes, 24.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, do all strings have lengths that are powers of two? Let me think. Starting with S (length 1). Each production replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length doubles each time. So the possible lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. Therefore, any string generated by this grammar must have a length that is a power of two. Since the given string's length is 24, which isn't a power of two, it can't be generated.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the string, maybe if the length check is sufficient. The grammar starts with S->NT28 NT17, which are two non-terminals. Each non-terminal must be expanded by the productions. Since all productions in CNF are binary, the string's length has to be a power of two.\n\nTherefore, even though the specific string may not be generated for other reasons, the fact that its length is 24, not a power of two, immediately disqualifies it.\n\nSo the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-430","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t3 t5 t6 t5 t4 t3 t2 t3 t1 t2 t0 t4 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit CNF because every production either ends with a terminal terminal (like A->a) or is a non-terminal followed by others, which in this case, the non-terminals don't directly appear as the start symbol leading to terminals. Wait, no, actually, the grammar looks like a mix because some rules produce terminals, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, all the productions in the given grammar produce two non-terminals. Or do they? Wait no, looking at the last lines, I see productions like NT4 -> a NTb and so on. For example, NT17 -> 't3'. So some of the productions are directly to terminals. That makes sense because in CNF, A can produce two non-terminals, or a terminal, right? Or is CNF only allowing two non-terminals? I think in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So in this case, the grammar does follow CNF.\n\nNext, the problem is about determining if the string is in the language generated by the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, all of them lowercase letters, but the grammar uses 'tX' where X is a number, and one terminal is 'a', but in the given string, all terminals start with 't' like t3, t5, etc. So perhaps the grammar was rewritten, or maybe the terminals are represented as t followed by numbers.\n\nSo, the string consists of 25 tokens, each being t followed by numbers like t3, t5, etc.\n\nTo check if this string is in the language, I'll use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for context-free grammars. \n\nFirst, I'll list all the non-terminals and terminals. But wait, looking at the grammar, there are a lot of non-terminals, but the given string only contains 't3' to 't20', I think. Wait, looking at the grammar, the only terminals are t3, t5, t4, t6, t0, etc., but looking at the productions, it seems that some non-terminals are set to produce terminals, like NT17 -> 't3'. So each of these productions leads to some 'tX' terminal.\n\nSo the string is a series of 't's with digits as their suffixes.\n\nNow, to apply CYK:\n\n1. Create a table where rows represent positions in the string, and columns represent possible non-terminals that can generate that substring.\n\n2. The string is of length 25, so the table will have 25 rows and 25 columns.\n\n3. We start by initializing the table. For each position i in the string, we find all non-terminals NT that can produce the ith terminal directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT17 produces 't3', so in position 1 of the string (assuming 1-based index), if the substring is 't3', NT17 is a candidate. Similarly, NT57 produces 't5' and 't3' in different rules, so in position 2, which is 't5', NT57 can produce it via NT57->NT5 (wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT57 has two productions: one to NT19 and NT9, and another to NT13 and NT30. Wait, let me look back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT57 -> NT19 NT9, and NT57 -> NT13 NT30. Also, NT30 can produce NT44 and NT13, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to first list all the non-terminals and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't3'\nNT57 -> 't5' (from NT57->NT19 NT9, but then NT19 produces NT52 NT53; not sure yet.)\nNT40 -> 't3' as per NT40->NT28 NT21, and in the rules, NT28 also leads to 't3'?

Perhaps there's a way to map each terminal to a specific non-terminal that produces it.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT48\nBut no, no direct production. Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> NT2 NT19 \u2192 NT2 is transformed, then NT19 might produce a terminal or something. Similarly, this needs a more systematic approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals are each produced by specific non-terminals, so for example:\n\n- If a string token is 't3', then it's produced by NT17.\n- If it's 't5', then NT57 produces it (as NT57->'t5' and 't3').\n- 't4' is produced by NT2 (since in the grammar, NT24 -> 't1' or is it? Wait, NT2? Looking back: NT2 is transformed into 't5' via NT2->'t5'. Wait, let's find all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. It might be better to list the non-terminals that directly produce terminals and note which terminal.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT57 -> NT19 NT9 \u2192 but in NT19, NT19: Let's see, looking for NT19's productions. From the grammar: NT19 is not explicitly defined beyond being produced in other places. Wait, perhaps in other rules, but looking at the productions, NT19 is produced as follows:\n\nLooking through all rules, I see NT57->NT19 NT9, so if NT19 can produce a terminal, that would be a path. Alternatively, perhaps other non-terminals like NT7 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, it's getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to build a list of all non-terminals that directly produce terminals, i.e., that have a production of A -> a where a is a single terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 -> 't3'? Wait, no. Looking again: NT7 has two rules:\n  1. NT7 -> NT13 NT47\n  2. NT7-> NT2 NT19\nWait, these are rules, but they don't produce a single terminal; they produce combinations of non-terminals. So no.\n\n- NT97? Wait, NT9 is not a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I've been mistaken. Let's go through all the right-hand sides (RHS) of the productions and look for any that are terminals, not combinations.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT57 can produce NT19 NT9 or NT13 NT30.\n- NT40 can produce NT28 NT21.\n- NT57 also has another production: NT7 -> 't3'. No, wait, no, NT7 is defined as above. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no, the production NT7-> 't3' doesn't exist, because looking through the provided rules, all rules starting with NT7 have non-terminals on the RHS. For example:\n\nLooking for A -> a (terminal):\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT17: 't3' \u2705\n- NT57: 't5' \u2705, 't3' \u2705? Wait, no. Let's see, looking through all the rules, I see that NT7 can't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, let me search for all '-> a' where a is a single terminal (like t3, t5, t4, t6, etc.) in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n1.

Looking at the grammar, the terminals are things ending with 't' and some with numbers, like t0, t1, etc., maybe representing the actual tokens in the string. The other productions have non-terminals on both sides, like S \u2192 NT28 NT17, meaning S can produce two non-terminals, and each of those can further break down.\n\nI think I should start by trying to parse the string step by step. Since the string starts with t0, I need to find which non-terminals can produce t0. Looking at the productions, NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 and NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46, and NT39 \u2192 NT0 NT33. Also, NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT20, and NT40 \u2192 NT47 NT11. Wait, maybe there's a production that directly gives t0 as NT9. Because in the provided grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT20. Hmm, but NT15 isn't a terminal. So maybe I need a chain.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the grammar, I notice that NT54 is defined as NT35 NT33, but I'm not immediately seeing a t0. Wait, in the productions, I see NT39 \u2192 NT0 NT33. So if I can derive NT0, then perhaps through a chain, I can produce t0.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT20. But NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7. NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55, and NT19 \u2192 't5'. So that would produce t5, but that's not t0. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe looking at NT36 and NT29, which are terminals. NT36 \u2192 't5' and NT29 \u2192 't5'. So t5 must be a terminal in this grammar. But in the string, I don't see any t5, except the last one is t5, maybe.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the structure of the CFG. Since all productions except the terminals are in the form A \u2192 BC, the parsing will require a certain structure. The string consists of 24 tokens. Let's see: the length is 24, and each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two, increasing the length by 1 each time. Wait, actually, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the length of the string doubles each time, but if the initial derivation builds up a larger string, we can't just have the length as a factor. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed using a top-down approach. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser could work, but I'm not sure. Another approach is to note that the grammar defines a context-free language, and perhaps the given string can be checked by analyzing the structure.\n\nWait, looking at the string: it starts with t0, which must come from a production that eventually leads to a 't0' terminal. Let's look for which non-terminals can produce t0.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (leads to two non-terminals, not terminals)\n- NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46 (non-terminals)\n- NT39 \u2192 NT0 NT33 (non-terminals)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT15 NT20 (non-terminals)\n- NT40 \u2192 NT47 NT11 (non-terminals)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT0 NT36 (non-terminals)\n- NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7 (non-terminals)\n- NT1 \u2192 NT58 NT41 (non-terminals)\n- NT51 \u2192 NT7 NT4 (non-terminals)\n- NT44 \u2192 NT14 NT2 (non-terminals)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT27 (right-recursive, might be a loop)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23 (non-terminals)\n- NT48 \u2192 NT1 NT23 (non-terminals)\n- NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56 (non-terminals)\n- NT14 \u2192 NT5 NT9 (non-terminals)\n- NT47 \u2192 NT1 NT44 (non-terminals)\n- NT9 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (non-terminal)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT20 NT36 (non-terminals)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT30 NT3 (non-terminals)\n- NT20 \u2192 NT10 NT2 (non-terminals)\n- NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43 (non-terminals)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2 (non-terminals)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT19 NT41 (non-terminals)\n- NT35 \u2192 NT21 NT6 (non-terminals)\n- NT29 \u2192 NT21 NT9 (non-terminals)\n- NT38 \u2192 NT8 NT51 (non-terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30 (non-terminal, could be an issue)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT35 NT33 (non-terminals)\n- NT30 \u2192 NT15 NT30 (this seems problematic because it's NT30 replacing with itself and something else)\n- NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24 (non-terminals)\n- NT11 \u2192 NT26 NT46 (non-terminals)\n- NT39 \u2192 NT0 NT33 (non-terminals)\n- NT54 \u2192 NT29 NT54 (this seems like another loop)\n\nWait, that's a lot of non-terminals, but perhaps I'm missing the direct productions that produce terminals. Wait, looking again, I might have missed some.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar as presented includes some non-terminals that when expanded, might result in terminals. For example, looking at NT54 \u2192 't3' and NT7 \u2192 't2' etc. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, the last set of productions have strings with 't' and numbers, like NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24, but then I see in another part: NT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41, which might be 't7' and 't41' but no, that's non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Looking back, I see in the grammar some lines end with a string like 't3', 't5', etc. For instance, near the end: NT54 \u2192 't3', NT29 \u2192 't5', NT27 \u2192 't6', NT36 \u2192 't5', NT0 \u2192 't5', NT32 \u2192 't1', etc. Oh wait, looking for the exact productions where the right-hand side is a single terminal. For example, NT54 \u2192 't3', NT9 \u2192 't3', NT40 \u2192 't5', etc. So some non-terminals when expanded produce a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, for example, NT54 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't3', NT17 \u2192 't5', etc.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can build the string by starting from the start symbol S and expanding it step by step, checking if we can derive the string.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nLet me note S is NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to draw the parse tree.

So these are the two that produce t0 when NT0 is applied.\n\nSo for the first token t0, perhaps we have a production where NT39 or NT29 is followed by something, but the actual token is t0, so perhaps NT0 is needed.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I should consider that t0 is generated by a non-terminal NT29 or NT39, but each of those requires two other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should break down the string step by step, trying to match each token with the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the string can be broken down into the required non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach: since each production in the CFG is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are other non-terminals or terminals, the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), I know that each production rule produces exactly two non-terminals. But looking at the provided grammar, it seems a bit messy with a lot of rules, so I'll need to break it down.\n\nFirst, I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT28 NT17. So, the string starts with \"t3 t5\" because NT28 -> 't4' and NT17 -> 't5', right? Wait, no, let me check NT28's production. Wait, looking back, NT28 -> NT17 NT7. And NT7 has several productions, one of which is NT7 -> NT4 NT48, which eventually leads to 't3'. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, the string starts with t3 t2. But S is NT28 NT17, which becomes t4 and t5, so the first two tokens should be t4 followed by t5. But the string provided starts with t3 t2, which doesn't match the start. That seems like a problem. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the start symbol. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the grammar says S -> NT28 NT17. So S starts with NT28 and NT17. Now, NT28 is a rule: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. And NT17 is another rule: NT17 -> NT1 NT58. Wait no, looking at the grammar, NT17 has a production NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and another NT17 -> 't5'. Wait, no, looking at the given rules: Let's see, NT17 is defined as NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and NT17 -> 't5'. Wait, is that correct? Or does NT17 have other productions? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT17 -> NT1 NT58 and also NT17 -> 't5' (from line 1: S-> NT28 NT17; NT7->... and line 17: NT7-> NT17 NT27; line 18: NT7-> NT13 NT30, etc., but also looking at other productions, line 32: NT17 -> 't5'). Oh, okay, so NT17 can produce either t5 or other combinations.\n\nWait, but line 32 says NT17 -> 't5'. So, the start symbol S is NT28 and NT17. If NT28 produces NT17 NT7, which in turn could produce 't3', maybe that's how we start getting t3. But initially, S would first expand into NT28 NT17, which would first expand NT28 into NT17 NT7. Let's see: S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so the first thing is NT28 expanding into NT17 and NT7.\n\nSo NT17 could be 't5' or something else. Wait, no, line 32 says NT17 -> 't5'. So when you have NT17, it can directly produce 't5' or other stuff via other productions. Wait, no, actually, looking back: the rule NT17 has two options: one is NT17 -> NT1 NT58, the other is NT17 -> 't5'. So, in the initial expansion, S would produce NT28 NT17, which becomes NT28 (which is NT17 NT7) and NT17. So the first step is S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, each of those NT17s can either be 't5' or expand further. So in the first step, the first NT17 can directly produce 't5', and the second NT17 can also produce 't5', right? So the initial part of the string would be 't5 t5'. But the given string starts with 't3 t2', which doesn't match. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the productions work. Let me re-examine. The start symbol is S, which is split into NT28 and NT17. NT28's production is NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which in turn may produce 't3' or other things. Let me see: NT7 has several productions. For example, line 1: NT7-> NT2 NT19, line 2: NT7-> NT13 NT30, line 3: NT7-> NT4 NT48, line4: NT7-> NT28 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, looking at line 37: NT5 -> NT43 NT24, etc. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each rule can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal, and we have to see which paths lead to the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a tree. The string given is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation must end with all non-terminals expanded into terminals.\n\nWait, the string is: t3 t2 t0 t4 t5 t0 t4 t1 t0 t4 t5 t4 t4 t2 t4 t0 t4 t3 t4 t5 t3 t4 t5 t2 t4 t3.\n\nBut S is NT28 and NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So after S, we have NT28: NT17 and NT7. So the string starts with [NT28 (as t4 and t3?), or maybe NT28 produces certain terminals. Wait, let's see: NT28's production is line 25: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. So NT28 is not a terminal; it's another non-terminal. So expanding S, which is NT28 NT17, becomes NT28 NT17 \u2192 NT17 and NT7.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach: let's see if the string can be parsed according to the grammar.\n\nEach token in the string must correspond to the expansion of a non-terminal in the grammar. So, starting from S, which is two non-terminals: X and Y. The string starts with t3 and t2, so maybe X is NT17 (which produces t3) and Y is NT17 (which produces t2)? But I'm not sure if that's possible.\n\nWait, line 32 says NT17 -> 't5'. So if NT17 is expanded into 't5', then how do we get t3 t2 in the beginning?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial expansion. Maybe S is NT28 and NT17, so the first symbols are the expansion of NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, looking at NT28: It can only be expanded into NT17 and NT7. So NT28 cannot produce t3 or t2 directly. So the first symbol from NT28 can't be t3 or t2 because NT28's production is NT17 and NT7. So the first token in the string would be from NT17 and NT7.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT28 NT17 \u2192 [NT28's expansion] [NT17's expansion]. So the first token from NT17's expansion. If NT17's only terminal production is 't5', then the first token must be 't5', but the given string starts with 't3 t2'. So that's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT28 can be terminal or non-terminal. Wait, no, from the grammar, every rule except the last few (like in lines 15-20: NT47, NT28, etc.) seem to be non-terminals. Wait, no, line 22: NT47 -> NT28 NT46. So that's a non-terminal rule. Wait, maybe some of the symbols are terminals, like in lines 99-100: NT39 can produce t5. Or line 92: NT23 can produce 't4'. Hmm, I'm not sure which are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, the productions are in the form NTx -> something. The right-hand side can be either a term (like 't3') or another production. So, in the grammar, the terminals are the 't' followed by a number, like t3, t2, etc. So each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT20 -> 't4' or 't5', which would indicate that 't4' and 't5' are terminal symbols.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. That should make parsing a bit straightforward, but with the string being quite long, I need to approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form grammars generate context-free languages, and the process might involve matching the string by breaking it down into the non-terminals and terminals according to the grammar rules. Since the string is a series of t's followed by numbers like t3, t2, etc., those numbers must correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level production is S -> NT28 NT17. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT28 and NT17. Let me write down the string parts: t3 t2 t3... Hmm, I need to see how each non-terminal can expand into the terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to match the terminals to the non-terminals. Starting with the first symbol, which is t3. Looking at the grammar, several non-terminals can derive to t3. For example, NT28 can become t3 via NT28 -> NT17 NT7, but wait, no. Wait, looking back, NT28's productions: NT28 -> NT17 NT7, but that can't be because NT7's productions include t3. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar is structured as S -> NT28 NT17. So the string must start with the expansion of NT28 and NT17. So the first symbol would come from one of these. But the string starts with t3, so I need to see which non-terminals can produce t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> NT19 NT9\n- NT3 -> NT19 NT55\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT36\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't3' or 't6'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT1 -> 't58' and then possibly others, but wait, some non-terminals directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking more carefully, NT17 directly produces 't3' (as per NT17 -> 't5' and maybe another rule? Wait, I need to check the grammar again. Wait, I see at the end of the grammar, under NT17, it says 't5'. So NT17 can produce 't5'. Also, looking back, NT27 -> 't6' and NT33 can produce 't3' or 't6'. \n\nWait, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should check the rules more methodically.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT7 can produce t3 (since in the initial rules, I saw that NT7->NT2 NT19, but wait, no). Wait, in the grammar, are any of the non-terminals directly producing 't's? Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't3'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT55 -> 'nt29 nt54' which doesn't produce a terminal. Wait, no, I think some of them do produce terminals.\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the grammar, there are several rules where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal. For instance:\n\n- NT2 -> 't54' ?? Wait, let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT1 NT15 --> not terminal\nNT17 -> 't3' --> yeah, NT17 directly produces 't3'\nNT27 -> 't6' --> yeah, NT27 -> 't6'\nNT32 -> 't1' --> NT32 -> 't1'\nNT33 -> 't3' or 't6'\nNT38 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't2'\nNT52 -> 't2'\nNT54 -> 't3'\nNT55 -> NT28 NT46 --> not terminal\nNT1 -> 't58'\nNT7 -> multiple rules, but none directly produce a terminal except maybe in the last part. Wait, looking back, I think maybe some non-terminals directly produce 't's, but it's a bit tricky.\n\nSo the only non-terminals that directly produce terminals seem to be:\n\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't3' or 't6'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't3' (as per the end of the grammar: NT9 -> 't3')\n- NT58 -> NT1 NT15, which doesn't produce a terminal.\n- NT48 -> 't3' (because NT17 -> 't3'), wait no, looking back: in the last rules, I see NT17 -> 't5' and something else. Wait, let me find the last NT17 rule.\n\nLooking at the very end of the grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nWait, so earlier I thought NT17-> 't3', but actually the rules at the very end are:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT17 has two rules:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' and another rule? Wait, checking the grammar, at the end:\n\nNT17 -> 't3'\nNT58 -> NT1 NT15\n...\nAt the very end, I see:\n\nNT17 -> 't5'\n\nWait, so maybe there's a confusion in the way the rules were listed. Perhaps in the actual grammar, NT17 can produce 't3' and 't5'. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through all the definitions again, after all the rules:\n\n- NT17 -> 't3'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT33 -> 't3' or 't6'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT9 -> 't3'\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n\nSo actually, NT17 can produce 't3' and 't5'. Similarly, some other non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nSo to start, the string begins with t3. So the first symbol is t3, which must come from one of the non-terminals that produce 't3'. Looking back, NT33 can produce 't3' or 't6'. So if the first token is t3, then in NT33, we can take the 't3' production. Alternatively, maybe NT38, NT4, etc., but looking at the string, the first symbol is t3.\n\nWait, but since S is NT28 NT17, the expansion starts with those two non-terminals. So the string must be divided into two parts: the expansion of NT28 and the expansion of NT17.\n\nSo the first token of the string is t3. Let me see which non-terminals can produce 't3' when expanding NT28 or NT17.\n\nWait, S is NT28 followed by NT17, so the string is split into two sequences: the first is generated by NT28, the second by NT17. So maybe I should split the string into two parts: the first part is generated by NT28 and the second by NT17.\n\nLooking at the string: `t3 t2 t3 t0 t3 t3 t5 t0 t4 t3 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t3 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t4 t3`\n\nThat's 25 tokens, which is an odd number, but since the grammar produces sequences that may be of even or odd lengths? Wait, maybe not, but perhaps it's structured in a way that each production contributes a certain number of tokens.\n\nBut to start, let's assume that the first token is from NT28 and the next from NT17.

Looking at the grammar, it seems to use NT symbols and has production rules like S \u2192 NT28 NT17. The terminals are represented by 't' followed by numbers, like t3, t5, etc. So, the string we need to check is a series of these terminals.\n\nThe process for checking if a string is generated by a grammar in CNF is similar to checking with an automaton, often involving looking for a leftmost derivation. Each step in the derivation replaces the leftmost non-terminal with two other non-terminals until all symbols are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t5. I should check which NT rules produce t5 directly. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 and NT0: NT15 \u2192 't0' and NT0 \u2192 't5'. So, the first part could be generated by NT15 or NT0.\n\nIf it's generated by NT0 \u2192 't5', then the next step is to see if NT0 has any productions. Looking at the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT27. Wait, but NT0 is on the left side of \u2192 NT15 NT27. So, does NT0 have any rules that produce directly to t5 or do they go through other non-terminals?\n\nWait, no. Because in CNF, each NT only directly produces two other NTs. The only way a terminal can appear is at the start of the derivation when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So, for example, in the grammar, NT30 can produce t4 or t3. So, if a non-terminal directly can generate a terminal, that terminal can appear in the string.\n\nSo, if the first element is t5, which is directly produced by NT0 or NT15, then perhaps the derivation starts with NT0 \u2192 't5'. But looking at the grammar, NT0 only appears as the start of the production, because I don't see NT0 \u2192 NT12 NT54 or any other rules except NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT27. Hmm, maybe I need to check the full set of grammar rules.\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive, so let me list out all the NT symbols and their production rules to see where the terminals come from.\n\nHere are the productions for terminal-looking NTs:\n- NT15 \u2192 't0'\n- NT0 \u2192 't5'\n- NT17 \u2192 't5' (from NT17 \u2192 't5')\n- NT27 \u2192 't6' and 't1' (NT27 has two productions)\n- NT3 \u2192 't3' (multiple times)\n- NT5 \u2192 't5'? Wait, I don't see NT5 in the productions. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the NT5 doesn't appear. The only NTs ending with 't' I can see are NT15, NT0, NT17, NT27, NT3, NT21, NT38, NT12, etc. So, the terminals in the string must correspond to NTs that produce them.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5. So, that must come from an NT that produces t5. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0' and NT0 \u2192 't5', NT17 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSo, any NT that can derive to t5 is NT0, NT15, or NT17. So, the first step in the derivation is to generate t5 from one of these.\n\nIf the string starts with t5, then the derivation must start with one of the NTs that produce t5. Let's assume that the string starts with NT0 \u2192 't5'. Then, the next step would be to handle the context after that, which is NT0's production. But wait, according to the grammar, NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT27. So, after producing t5, the next part would involve expanding NT15 and NT27.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, terminals can't have anything producing them in the middle. So, if the first symbol is t5, the previous NT must have directly produced it. So, the expansion of the start symbol S would have to generate t5 along with other symbols. But S is defined as NT28 NT17, so the derivation must start with NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to think of the string as a sequence of NTs and t symbols, but in this case, all the beginning are t symbols. So perhaps the string starts with NT0 producing t5, but the NT15 and NT27 must also produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut in the given string, the next symbol after t5 is another t5, then t3, t2, etc. So, perhaps the first t5 comes from NT0 \u2192 't5', and the rest comes from the symbols that NT0 produces. But in the grammar, NT0 \u2192 NT15 NT27. So, after t5, we would have the expansion of NT15 and NT27.\n\nLooking at NT15, it produces 't0'. So, the next symbol is another t5. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first t5 comes from NT17 \u2192 't5', since NT17 is defined as producing 't5'. So, perhaps S can derive to NT28 NT17. Let's see, NT28 \u2192 't5'?\n\nWait, no. Looking at the production rules, NT28 is defined as NT43 NT10, because looking at the provided grammar, for example, \"NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\". Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The provided grammar includes a line like NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, but looking through the list, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me find the production rules for NT28.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT43 NT10\nWait, no, actually, the grammar has:\n\n\"NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\"\n\nWait, wait, looking through the provided lines, I see:\n\nLine by line:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7\n\nYes, so NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, S is NT28 NT17, so S produces NT28 NT17, which is (NT17 NT7) NT17.\n\nTherefore, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, but that's a triple of NTs, which is not allowed in CNF, because each production is two NTs. Wait, no, in CNF, the left-hand side is a single NT, and the right-hand side is two NTs, which can then be either expanded or become terminals.\n\nSo, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT28 NT17. Then, we can decide which part to expand first. Leftmost derivation would expand the leftmost NT, which is NT28.\n\nSo, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (from the production rule). So, now, S becomes NT17 (from S's production) followed by the expansion of NT28 (NT17 NT7) and then NT17.\n\nWait, no, the S's production is NT28 and NT17. So, when expanding S, we consider the leftmost NT. Let's outline the steps:\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17 (step 1)\nNow, the leftmost NT is NT28, so we expand it:\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (step 2)\nSo, now we have NT17 (from S) followed by NT17 NT7, and then NT17.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the string as a series of NT and terminal symbols and check if it can be built through the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t5 t5 t3 t2 t0 t4 t0 t3 t3 t0 t3 t2 t4 t0 t0 t3 t0 t4 t3 t3 t0 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3.\n\nWait, that's 28 elements. The start is t5, so the first NT must produce t5. Let's check which NTs can do that.\n\nNT15 \u2192 't0' (so not useful for first t5)\nNT0 \u2192 't5' (yes)\nNT17 \u2192 't5' (yes)\nNT27 \u2192 't6' and 't1' (no)\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\nNT4 \u2192 't2'\nNT5: Doesn't exist in the productions?

The grammar starts with S -> NT28 NT17. So the string should derive from S. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals, except where the terminals (from the 't' list) appear. \n\nI notice that the grammar uses symbols like NT followed by numbers. Some of these symbols eventually resolve to terminals (t0 to t5). For example, NT7 -> NT2 NT19, and NT2 -> T5. \n\nI think the best way is to start from S and see if I can expand it step by step to match the string. But that might take a long time. Alternatively, I can check if the string can be parsed by the grammar. Since it's a CFG in CNF, a recursive descent parser or an algorithm like CYK might help, but I'll try a more manual approach.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. Let's count how each symbol resolves. For example, the first symbol is t3. Looking at the grammar, NT58 -> NT1 NT58? Wait no, more accurately, NT17 -> t5. So if the string starts with t3, perhaps it's from NT3 -> 't3' as in NT17. Or maybe another rule.\n\nWait, I think I need to build the parse tree. Let me see:\n\nThe first symbol is t3, which can come from several places. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 -> 't3' (from NT17), and also from NT10 -> NT23 NT2 (but NT23 isn't a terminal). Alternatively, looking for NTs that end in 't3':\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT3 -> NT19 NT55\n- NT56 -> NT3 NT2\n- NT33 -> NT55 NT6\n- NT51 -> NT1 NT15\n- NT1 -> NT58 NT41\n- NT47 -> NT57 NT33\n- NT17 -> 't5' (Wait, NT17 has a production NT17 -> t5 and another production to NT27?)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for NT3:\n\nLooking through the rules, only NT33 and NT56 might lead somewhere, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, I think it's better to map each NT production to the terminals they can produce.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the entire string and build up the parse tree, ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps building the parse tree step by step:\n\nThe string starts with t3. So the first part must be a derivation that leads to t3. Let me think where that comes from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has the following production:\n\nNT35 -> NT21 NT6\n\nNT21 -> 't0' according to the production NT23 -> 't0'. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nAlternatively, looking through all the NT symbols:\n\nNT17 -> t5 and another production to NT27.\n\nNT7 has several productions, including one to t5 (if I look correctly, NT7 -> NT13 NT30; but both NT13 and NT30 may eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe an alternative approach is to note that each production is either to two non-terminals or a terminal. So the entire string must be derived by a series of these steps.\n\nWait, since it's a binary CFG, each production splits the string, so the string must have a binary expansion that can match each split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent each NT and see if the string can be broken down accordingly.\n\nAnother idea: the entire string has 27 tokens, which is 3^3. In Chomsky Normal Form, each step doubles the string, but with two non-terminals. Hmm, but 27 is 3^3, so perhaps three expansions.\n\nWait, I think I'm complicating things. Maybe it's easier to use a top-down approach, starting with S and trying to find splits.\n\nS -> NT28 NT17\n\nSo the entire string should be a concatenation of the derivations of NT28 and NT17.\n\nLet me first look at NT28:\n\nLooking at NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo the first half comes from NT28 and the second half from NT17.\n\nSo the string starts with NT28 -> NT17 NT7, which would produce something like (deriv of NT17) (deriv of NT7). \n\nLet me see: NT17 has a production that can produce 't5' directly. Alternatively, NT17 can split into NT27. Wait, looking back: NT17's productions are:\n\n- NT17 -> t5 (as per looking: \"NT17 -> 't5'\" but wait, originally, NT17 is a symbol, and in the grammar, looking through all rules:\n\nWait, checking the production for NT17:\n\nLooking through the production list, I see \"NT17 -> t5\" \u2014 no, wait, actually, in the production rules, I see \"NT17 -> 't5'\".

Wait, looking at the lines, I see \"NT48 -> NT20 NT26\", but no NT19 production seems to resolve to a terminal.

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, let's parse the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, except for the start symbol. However, some productions here have terminals, like the ones for NT17 -> 't3', which suggests terminal symbols, but wait\u2014that contradicts CNF because in CNF, all productions must be between non-terminals except for the terminal strings of length one. So maybe these are base productions.\n\nWait, the top-level grammar starts with S -> NT28 NT17, which are both non-terminals, so that's fine. The right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT17 -> 't3', which would be the base cases. So the end of the string corresponds to these.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t5 t5 t0 t0 t4 t2 t3 t0 t4 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t0 t0 t0 t0 t6 t5 t4 t1 t3 t0 t5 t3 t5`.\n\nLet's analyze the structure.

Let's break this down.\n\nNT17 is 't3', so each NT17 -> 't3'. So that's where 't3's come from. The other part is NT7. Let's look at NT7's productions.\n\nNT7 has several productions:\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\n- NT7 -> NT20 NT26 (but wait, that's a non-terminal)\nWait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terminals. Let me check the productions for NT7 again. Looking back:\n\nYes, there are two options for NT7 that produce terminals:\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48\nSo those are the ones that can produce terminal symbols.\n\nIn our string, we have t2, t4, etc., so these must come from NT7's terminal productions.\n\nLet's try to decompose the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t5 t5. From the start symbol S, which is NT28 and NT17, each NT28 is NT17 and NT7, as S -> NT28 NT17, NT28 is NT17 NT7. So the string becomes:\n\nt3 (NT17) followed by NT7 (t5?), but wait, the string starts with t5 t5. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with two 't5's. Let me consider the structure again.\n\nS is NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 expands to NT17 NT7 (since S -> NT28 NT17, and NT28 -> NT17 NT7).\n\nSo S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nBut NT17 is 't3', so the string starts with 't3' from the first NT17, then we have NT7 and then another 't3' from the second NT17.\n\nBut the string starts with 't5 t5', which suggests that perhaps I have some other productions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in breaking down the initial part.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using a parsing strategy. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent approach or a CYK parser. Let me consider which is easier.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals to terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list of tokens:\n\nt5, t5, t0, t0, t4, t2, t3, t0, t4, t2, t0, t4, t5, t4, t3, t0, t0, t0, t0, t6, t5, t4, t1, t3, t0, t5, t3, t5.\n\nThat's quite long (30 tokens). I need to see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the possible ways to parse this.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 is NT17 NT7.\n\nSo S is NT17 (t3) NT7 NT17 (t3). So the string starts with t3 followed by NT7 and another t3. But our string starts with t5 t5. This suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding how the start symbol is used or perhaps looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the possible ways to get t5 and t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t5 and t5 are terminal symbols, so their production must be from NT52, perhaps, since in the grammar, there are some NT with 't2' and 't5' at the end. Let me check the terminal productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT28 -> 't5'? Wait, looking back, actually, the terminals come from the last parts of some productions:\n\nFor example, NT28 has a production NT28 -> 't5' (wait, no\u2014let me check again. Let's see the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe first part has NT57 -> NT13 NT47\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see that several have a terminal in their productions. For example:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7: that's two non-terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the ones that have terminals on the right-hand side are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't2'\n- NT24 -> 't4'\n- NT27 -> 't6'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT53 -> 't6'\n- NT57 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't4'\n- NT37 (wait, I don't see that) Hmm, let's check:\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\nNT9 -> NT21 NT9 is a production but the right-hand side includes a terminal 't3', no\u2014I think I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's look for all rules where the right-hand side includes a terminal symbol. From the grammar given, here are the ones that produce terminals:\n\n- NT57 -> 't5' (I think not\u2014I need to look through all productions.\n\nWait, no, here's the full list again, and I'll scan for any rules that produce a terminal directly:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT57 -> NT13 NT47 (both non-terminals)\n- NT40 -> NT28 NT21 (non-terminals)\n- NT48 -> NT20 NT26 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 -> NT2 NT19 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 -> NT13 NT30 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT48 (non-terminals)\n- NT44 -> NT21 NT14 (non-terminals)\n- NT28 -> NT17 NT7 (non-terminals)\n- NT4 -> 't2' (Wait, this is a production of a non-terminal NT4 producing 't2')\n- NT11 -> 't2' (another NT producing 't2')\n- NT0 -> 't5' (another terminal production)\n- NT2 -> 't5' (another)\n- NT27 -> 't5' (another)\n- NT3 -> 't3' (another)\n- NT6 -> 't4' (another)\n- NT9 -> 't3' (another)\n- NT52 -> 't2' (another)\n- NT32 -> 't1' (another)\n- NT54 -> 't3' (another)\n- NT15 -> 't0' (another)\n- NT21 -> 't0' (another)\n- NT38 -> 't4' (another)\n- NT17 -> 't5' (another)\n- NT58 -> 't1' (the last NT17 production is 't5')\n- NT41 -> 't5'\n- NT47 -> 't5'\n\nWait, from the list, it seems that NT17, NT28, NT4, NT11, NT0, NT2, NT27, NT3, NT6, NT9, NT52, NT32, NT54, NT15, NT21, NT38, NT58, NT41, and NT47 all have productions that produce terminals. So the terminal symbols in the string must come from these non-terminals.\n\nNow, let's look at the given string: it starts with t5, t5, etc.\n\nFrom the string, the first two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) requires each production rule to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) or a single terminal. The given grammar fits this because, for example, S -> NT28 NT17, and all other rules are either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nNext, the task is to see if this grammar can produce the provided string. The string consists of a series of terminals such as 't5', 't3', etc. So, this is a direct derivation starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a top-down or bottom-up parsing. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser might work, but manually simulating that could be complex. Alternatively, maybe I can try to see if the string can be broken down according to the given productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's split it into individual tokens: t5, t2, t3, t0, t0, t4, t1, t0, t0, t4, t1, t3, t0, t2, t5, t3, t0, t5, t5, t2, t0, t4, t4, t5, t4, t3, t3, t3.\n\nI start with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S can produce NT28 NT17. So, the first production is S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't5 t2 ...'. Let's see what NT28 and NT17 can produce.\n\nLooking up the productions for NT28:\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7. So, substituting back, S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17 (since NT28 -> NT17 NT7 and S -> NT28 NT17).\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me re-examine that.\n\nWait, no, S -> NT28 NT17, and NT28 is rewritten as NT17 NT7. So the entire start becomes NT17 NT7 NT17. So far, the string starts with 't5 t2', which would correspond to the first symbols in S -> NT28 NT17 being NT28 first. Let me see.\n\nWait, let's clarify: S -> NT28 NT17, so the leftmost symbols are NT28 NT17. Let's process NT28 first.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7, so substituting, S becomes NT17 NT7 NT17. Now, we'll process the leftmost symbol NT17.\n\nLooking at NT17's productions:\nNT17 -> NT1 NT58, and NT17 -> others, but from the given rules, NT17 also says -> 't5'. Oh, wait! The production for NT17 includes an epsilon production, but looking at the rules, I see that NT17 can also directly produce 't5' (from the last rule: NT17 -> 't5'). So, NT17 can produce either 't5', or other combinations, but 't5' is a direct production.\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the given grammar:\n\nNT17 -> 't5' is a production, right? Let me check the rules:\n\nYes, in the given grammar, the line says NT17 -> 't5'. So that's a direct production. That means when I have NT17 in the leftmost position, it can immediately produce 't5', which would consume the 't5' at the start of the string.\n\nSo, after consuming the first 't5', we still have 't2 t3 t0 ...' left.\n\nWait, but according to the production S -> NT28 NT17, the first symbol is NT28, which turns into NT17 NT7. So the initial step is S -> NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nBut then, processing the leftmost NT17, which can become 't5', so the first token is 't5', which matches the string. Now, we're left with NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, this seems a bit confusing. Let me try to retrace.\n\nStart: S -> NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, the string starts as NT17 NT7 NT17.\n\nNow, we process the leftmost NT17, which can be 't5', so we consume 't5' and replace NT17 with the next symbol. Wait, but in this case, NT17 can produce 't5', which is a terminal. So the stack would be 't5' followed by NT7 and NT17.\n\nWait, but wait\u2014no, because in the production S -> NT28 NT17, which expands to NT17 NT7 NT17. So the first symbol is NT17, which we can replace with 't5', consuming 't5' and leaving us with NT7 NT17.\n\nWait, no. The expansion is: S -> NT17 NT7 NT17. So when we process the leftmost NT17, which is the first symbol, we replace it with 't5', consuming 't5', and now we're left with NT7 NT17.\n\nSo after this, the remaining string is t2 t3 t0 t0 t4 t1 t0 t0 t4 t1 t3 t0 t2 t5 t3 t0 t5 t5 t2 t0 t4 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second symbol in the original string is 't2' after 't5'. So now we have to process the next symbols.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try to see if each production can be used in a way that leads to the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find a way to generate the string step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the productions for each NT:\n\nLooking through the grammar, many of the non-terminals have productions either to two other non-terminals or to a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n- NT34 -> ?\nWait, let me go through each NT and list their possible productions.\n\n1.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

So S starts with NT28 \u2192 't3'? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the end of the grammar, for NT28, it seems to produce 't3'. Similarly, NT17's production leads to 't5' (from the end of the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't5'). So S starts with NT28 generating 't3' and NT17 generating 't5'. But in the string, the first two tokens are 't5' and 't2'. Oh wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the order.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the sequence is NT28 then NT17. So the first token should be whatever NT28 produces and the second token the NT17 produces. From the end of the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't3' and NT17 \u2192 't5'. So the string should start with 't3 t5', but the given string starts with 't5 t2'. That's a problem. Unless I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look more carefully. Let me go through each production step by step.\n\nThe first symbol is 't5', which should come from NT28, and since NT28's production is 't3', but the first token is 't5', that doesn't match. Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me check the start production again.\n\nS is NT28 followed by NT17, so the first symbol is from NT28, the second from NT17. So the first symbol should be NT28's output, and the second NT17's output.\n\nLooking at NT28: The productions for NT28 end with NT28 \u2192 't3'. So the first symbol in the string should be 't3'. But in the string, it's 't5' first. That suggests that the string does not start with 't3', which would be the expected first symbol. So that's a red flag.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck. Looking at the grammar rules, S is NT28 and NT17. From the list, for example, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (among others). Wait, the production for NT28 is:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, under NT28: There are multiple productions, including NT28 \u2192 't3'. Is that correct? Or perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking back: The very end... Oh, at the very end, under NT28, it lists NT28 \u2192 't3'. So NT28 directly produces 't3'. So S, which starts with NT28, would produce 't3' followed by another symbol from NT17.\n\nSimilarly, NT17 has a production that directly gives 't5'. So the string should start with 't3 t5'. But the given string starts with 't5 t2', which doesn't match. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the first two symbols don't align with any possible derivation from S.\n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that I'm misunderstanding the order? Let me check again. S is NT28 followed by NT17. So the first token is NT28's output, and the second is NT17's output. So for S, first 't3', then 't5'. The given string starts with 't5 t2', which doesn't fit.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the right-hand sides, I notice a few terminals, but most are non-terminals. However, many of the productions end in terminals, so this might be an ambiguous grammar or have a structure that allows the string to be generated.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5 in various combinations. Wait, no, looking again, the string is all t0, t3, t4, t5, no t1 or t2 except t1 is missing but t2 is present? Wait, no, let me check. The string is:\n\nt0, t0, t3, t5, t3, t5, t5, t5, t0, t0, t4, t0, t4, t3, t5, t0, t0, t0, t3, t5, t0, t4, t5, t4, t5, t4, t3, t4, t3\n\nI count t0, t3, t5, t4, but no t1 or t2 except t1 doesn't appear. In the grammar, the terminals present are t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5. But in the string, t1 and t2 are entirely missing. So first thought: maybe the grammar can't generate strings without t1 and t2.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals produce a terminal directly. For example, NT17 \u2192 't3', which is t3. But also, other non-terminals might produce t1 or t2. For example, I see NT4 \u2192 't2' and NT11 \u2192 't2'. So the string being generated without t1 and t2 would conflict with the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, but in the string, t2 never occurs. So if the grammar allows for the absence of t2, maybe that's acceptable. But looking deeper, t2 is produced by some non-terminals, but is it possible for the string to not include t2? Let's check the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT28 NT17. Now, NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. Wait, NT17 produces 't5', and then NT7 can produce several things, including 't3' (from NT30, which may or may not lead to t3).\n\nWait, looking at NT17 \u2192 't3' in some cases, but also NT17 can produce other things. For example, NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58. Then NT58 \u2192 't1', so that would introduce t1.\n\nBut in the given string, t1 doesn't appear at all. So if the grammar can generate the string without using t1 at all, it could be possible. Alternatively, the grammar might have a way to generate the string without ever using t1 or t2.\n\nWait, maybe I can think in reverse. Let me consider the production rules that lead to terminals. For example, NT17 can produce 't3'; that's straightforward. NT58 can produce 't1' or 't5', so that's another way. NT30 can produce 't4' or 't3', etc.\n\nBreaking down the string into parts, perhaps I can try to parse it step by step, checking if each part can be derived from the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if all the symbols in the string can be matched by the grammar without requiring the production of t1 or t2. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar doesn't allow the production of t2 at all, but from looking, NT17 can't produce t2, but NT4 can (from NT4 \u2192 't2'), but maybe that's not used here.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar for any non-terminals that produce t1 or t2. I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't2'\n- NT21 \u2192 't0' or 't2' (looking at NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2 or NT23 NT2, etc. Wait, in the provided grammar, NT21 has several productions, but let me find if it ever produces t2. Yes: looking at NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT2, so if NT35 can produce a non-terminal that allows this, then t2 can be part of the string. But in our case, the string doesn't have t2.\n\nSo if the string can be generated without using any t2, it would satisfy that.\n\nLet me start breaking down the string.\n\nThe string is: t0, t0, t3, t5, t3, t5, t5, t5, t0, t0, t4, t0, t4, t3, t5, t0, t0, t0, t3, t5, t0, t4, t5, t4, t5, t4, t3, t4, t3.\n\nSo 27 symbols in total.\n\nLet me see if I can find a parse tree for the entire string.\n\nThe top-level symbol is S, which is NT28 NT17.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (as per the production NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7 or others, but this is one option). So let's follow this path.\n\nSo nt28 (NT28) \u2192 nt17 (NT17) nt7 (NT7).\n\nNT17 can be 't5' or other things. In this case, let's see: NT17 \u2192 NT1 NT58 \u2192 then NT58\u2192't1' or 't5'. But in the string, t1 is not present, so perhaps it's the other branch.\n\nAlternatively, NT17 could produce 't5' directly. Let's go with that.\n\nSo NT17 \u2192 't5', which matches the first t5 in the string? Wait, wait, the string starts with two t0s. So no, that wouldn't match.

{"custom_id":"request-500","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a series of symbols, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has productions where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It seems to be a bunch of productions where each non-terminal expands into two other symbols, and eventually, some of these terminals are actual 't' symbols with numbers, like 't0', 't1', etc. So, the base case is when a non-terminal is expanded into a literal terminal like 't5', 't3', etc. \n\nThe string to check is a sequence of these terminals: t5, t5, t0, t0, and so on. My plan is to see if this string can result from the given CFG. \n\nI think the way to approach this is to perform a parsing attempt or to consider the possible derivations. Given the size of the string, it's quite long, so manually tracing the derivation might be tedious. Alternatively, I can try to see if the structure of the string aligns with the possible non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, S starts with NT57 and NT28. NT57 can go to NT13 and NT47, and NT28 can go to NT17 and NT7. Then NT17 goes to NT1 and NT58, and NT7 can go to various combinations, eventually leading to terminals like t3, t4, t5, etc.\n\nI also see that the string starts with t5, t5, t0, t0. Looking at the grammar, t0 comes from NT30, which also goes to t4 and NT30 again. Wait, no, T30 can go to NT44 and NT13, or to NT15 and NT30, or to NT30 and NT30. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can represent the string as a parse tree. Each node would be a non-terminal, and the leaves would be the terminals. The question is whether the parse tree can be built from the given grammar.\n\nBut the string is 29 symbols long, which is pretty long. Another approach is to calculate the possible length of the string based on the number of productions. In CNF, each production adds one more non-terminal on the left. So, the minimum number of steps to derive a string from S is the height of the parse tree. Each step adds at most two symbols on the left. Hmm, but since each step only produces two symbols, the length of the string grows linearly as each terminal is added at the bottom.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production for a non-terminal produces exactly two symbols, so the maximum length of the string derivable from a non-terminal is 2^n, where n is the number of steps. So, starting from S, which can derive two non-terminals, then each can derive two more, and so on. Therefore, if you have k levels, the maximum length of the string is 2^k.\n\nBut the input string is 29 symbols. 2^5 = 32, so possibly, after 5 productions, you can have up to 32 symbols, which is longer than 29. So it's possible within 5 levels. But perhaps the string is structured in a way that requires more levels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use the CYK algorithm to parse the string, but implementing CYK is time-consuming. Since I'm just trying to determine \"Yes\" or \"No\" here, perhaps I can look for patterns or possible inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t5 appears multiple times at the beginning, then t0 appears in pairs. Let me check the productions that lead to these.\n\nt5 is derived directly from NT48 and NT54. For example, S can go to NT57 and NT28. NT57 can go to NT13 and NT47, which then may go to other non-terminals or terminals. But in the string, t5 appears early on, which suggests that perhaps S is expanding into NT57 or another non-terminal that can produce t5.\n\nWait, let's look back. The string starts with t5 t5. So the first terminal is t5, which comes from NT48 and NT54. So the initial S would have to produce NT57 and NT28, each of which eventually becomes t5.\n\nBut S is S -> NT57 NT28. NT57 can derive to NT47 and NT19, or other combinations. Wait, maybe I need to look at all the possible ways a non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT29 -> 't5'\n- NT30 -> 't4' or 't3'\nWait, some non-terminals result in 't0', 't1', etc. For example:\n\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n- NT1 -> 't58' and then 't58' goes to 't1' and other non-terminals, which eventually lead to 't5' via NT54.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Another approach: think about what t0 can be derived from. Looking at the grammar, NT30 can be split into NT13 and NT47, or NT44 and NT13, etc. But also, NT30 can go to NT15 and NT30. Wait, maybe it's easier to list all non-terminals that directly produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can make a list for each terminal in the string what non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t5, t5, t0, t0, t5, t2, t3, t0, t4, t5, t4, t2, t6, t0, t0, t2, t3, t0, t4, t5, t3, t0, t4, t5, t3, t5, t3, t0.\n\nSo t5's in positions 0,1,4,10,20,22,23,25,27,28, and others are t0's etc.\n\nLooking at each terminal:\n\n- t0: The only production that produces t0 is NT30 -> NT15 NT30. Wait, no, looking back, I see:\n\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30. Also, NT30 can go to NT30 NT30. Hmm, but I might have mixed up earlier parts.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully. The rules for NT30 are:\n\nNT30 -> NT44 NT13\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30\nNT30 -> NT30 NT30\n\nWait, earlier I thought it went to NT15 NT30, but according to the given grammar:\n\nYes:\n\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30\nand\nNT30 -> NT30 NT30\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided grammar, the rule for NT30 is:\n\nNT30 -> NT44 NT13\nNT30 -> NT15 NT30\nNT30 -> NT30 NT30\n\nSo the direct productions from NT30 are into NT44 and NT13, or NT15 and NT30, or NT30 and NT30. But NT15 can produce 't0' directly. So, through NT30, if a path chooses the second production (NT15 NT30), and since NT15 is replaced by 't0', that would allow NT30 to produce t0.\n\nSo, for instance, if you have NT30 -> NT15 NT30, and then replace NT15 with t0, and the other NT30 with another t0, you can get t0 t0.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so each production must split into two non-terminals or terminals. The key is that eventually, all non-terminals must resolve into terminals.\n\nSo, starting from S, which is split into two non-terminals, each of which must eventually produce terminals. The first few symbols in the string are t5 t5, which suggests that both non-terminals derived from S must produce t5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only non-terminals that produce t5 directly are NT48 and NT54 because:\n\nNT48 -> NT20 NT26\nNT20 \u2192 NT23 NT21\nNT23 \u2192 NT7 NT41\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48\nWait, that's a loop, isn't it? So maybe NT48 eventually leads back. Or perhaps NT54 can produce t5.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar:\n\n- NT40 -> NT47 NT11\n- NT48 -> NT20 NT26\n- NT20 -> NT10 NT2\n- NT10 -> NT23 NT21\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is: `t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t5 t1 t2`.\n\nFirst, I remember that since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. This makes the parsing and analysis a bit more straightforward. Also, the grammar uses terminals labeled 't0' to 't5' as well as some NTs (Non-terminals) like S, NT57, NT30, etc.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. To do this, I'll probably need to perform a kind of parsing or at least try to break down the string into the constituent parts that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it starts with `t3 t5 t5 ...` which might correspond to the start symbol S since S initially produces NT57 NT28 NT17. Wait, no. In CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so the initial expansion of S would be NT57 NT28 NT17? Wait, no. Actually, looking at the grammar, S is defined as NT57 -> NT28 NT17 and NT57 -> NT19 NT9, but I think I got that wrong. Wait, the grammar starts with S -> NT57 NT28 NT17. Wait, no, the grammar shows S -> NT57 NT28 NT17. Oh wait, no, in the grammar, S is not present because all the initial rules are for NT57, etc. Wait, no, in the given grammar, the first rule is S -> NT57 NT28 NT17, which seems odd because in CNF, each rule should have exactly two non-terminals. Wait, that's not possible because NT57, NT28, and NT17 are all non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT57 NT28 NT17, which has three non-terminals, so that can't be in CNF. That's strange because the problem states it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Maybe I read it wrong. Wait, the initial line says: \"Grammar: S -> NT57 NT28 NT17\". So that's three non-terminals, which would violate CNF. CNF requires productions to have at most two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe the user made a typo, but since the problem states it's in CNF, I have to assume that each production has exactly two non-terminals. Perhaps S is part of the non-terminals? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the S is a non-terminal, and the initial production is S -> NT57 NT28 NT17, which has three NTs. That can't be right. Maybe I should double-check. No, the user provided the grammar as starting with S -> NT57 NT28 NT17, which has three non-terminals. That would not be in CNF because CNF allows productions of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. But S is a non-terminal here, so having three non-terminals in one production seems impossible in CNF. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps it's a typo, and the initial S is a terminal, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant S to be the only rule, but the other rules are all the other non-terminals. Maybe the S rule was meant to produce two non-terminals, but it's written as three. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps S is a terminal, but that's not logical. Hmm, perhaps I need to proceed despite this confusion.\n\nWait, perhaps S is part of the left-hand side, and it's a non-terminal. But then S->NT57 NT28 NT17 is a production with three non-terminals, which is not allowed in CNF. So maybe the actual start symbol has more rules, but looking at the grammar, it's not shown. Alternatively, perhaps the user made an error, and the initial S is meant to be a single production, but the problem states it's in CNF, so each production must be two symbols.\n\nThis is a problem because it's impossible to have a production with three non-terminals in CNF. So perhaps I should proceed with another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial rule is a typo, and perhaps it's supposed to be S -> NT57 NT28 and then another rule for NT17. Or maybe I should proceed as if the initial rule is correct and try to find a way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S -> NT57 NT28 NT17, and maybe the NT28 NT17 have further productions. So for example, S could expand into NT57, which expands into something else. But each step in the expansion can only produce two non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the string starting with t3. Looking at the string, it starts with t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t5 t1 t2.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the rules that produce t3. Looking at the provided grammar, the terminal symbols are t0 to t5. The rules starting with NT17, NT27, etc., end with t3, t5, etc. \n\nLooking for rules that produce t3: for example, NT17 -> t5 (not t3), NT27 -> t6 (or t1?), wait, in the grammar, there are some rules ending with 't3' or other terminals. Let me check the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT19 NT55\n- NT13 -> NT1 NT7\n- NT27 -> NT17 NT27 (recursion, but not helpful)\n- NT57 -> NT19 NT9\n- NT27 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT32 -> NT30 NT3\n- NT30 -> NT15 NT30 (recursion)\n- NT30 -> NT19 NT0\n- NT54 -> NT35 NT33\n- NT40 -> NT28 NT21\n- NT44 -> NT14 NT2\n- NT53 -> NT12 NT23\n- NT12 -> NT19 NT41\n- NT13 -> NT1 NT7\n- NT38 -> NT8 NT51\n- NT14 -> NT5 NT9\n- NT47 -> NT57 NT11\n- NT12 -> NT29 NT13\n- NT39 -> NT56 NT30\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT6 -> 't4'\n- NT48 -> 't1'\n- NT15 -> 't0'\n- NT21 -> 't0'\n- NT38 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't2'\n- NT32 -> 't1'\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n\nWait, looking at the terminal symbols, some non-terminals produce 't3', 't5', etc. For example:\n\n- NT17 -> 't5'\n- NT54 -> 't3'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT0 -> 't5'\n\nSo, in the initial string, the first symbols are t3, t5, t5, etc. So perhaps the string can be built from the rules that produce t3 and t5 in the earliest steps.\n\nLooking at S's production, assuming it produces NT57, NT28, NT17. But S has three non-terminals, which is not allowed in CNF. So perhaps the initial production is supposed to be S -> NT57 NT28, and then another production for NT17. That way, each production is only two non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed without considering the initial rule correctly and try to find the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is incorrect, and perhaps the problem is intended to ignore that. Perhaps S is part of a larger expansion, but without more information, it's challenging.\n\nGiven the initial confusion, maybe a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar, treating each 't' as a terminal and non-terminals as variables that can be expanded.\n\nThe string is: t3 t5 t5 t5 t5 t5 t3 t2 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t3 t4 t5 t4 t5 t3 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t5 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule either produces two terminal symbols or one non-terminal. Also, each rule has only two non-terminals on the left. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or two terminals, and no epsilon productions. But looking at the given grammar, I see that there are epsilon-like rules ending with 't's and numbers. Wait, no, actually, some rules end with 't' which might indicate terminals, but others have numbers which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, in most CNF definitions, terminals are something like 'a', 'b', etc., and non-terminals have uppercase letters. But here, some rules have 't' followed by a number or something like 't3' which probably indicates terminals. Or maybe the grammar uses 't' and numbers to denote terminal symbols. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that some rules end with 't', which I assume are terminal symbols. For example, 'NT2 -> NS2 t3 t', wait, actually, the first token is 't3', which might be a terminal symbol. Similarly, 't5', 't2', etc. So, I think the terminals are the words with 't' followed by numbers, and non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers.\n\nThe string I need to check is a sequence of terminals: t3, t6, t2, t5, etc. So each token in the string must be derived from a production in the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to work backwards. Start from the string and see if it can be built up by the grammar. Alternatively, I could see if each symbol in the string is covered by the productions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree top-down. Since it's in CNF, it's efficient, but since the string is long, maybe it's easier to look for patterns or check if all the required symbols are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll list each token:\n\nt3, t6, t2, t5, t5, t4, t5, t5, t5, t0, t5, t0, t4, t1, t0, t4, t3, t5, t0, t3, t4, t5, t4, t4, t5, t4, t3, t3, t2, t3, t4, t5.\n\nFirst, I'll check if all tokens are present as terminals in the grammar. Let's see:\n\n- t3: Looking through the rules, there's a rule NT54 -> t3. So yes, terminal t3 exists.\n- t6: Hmm, looking at the rules, I don't see any terminal t6. Wait, where is this 't6' in the grammar? Let me scan through.\nLooking again, I notice that in some production rules, it's called 't6', like 'NT38 -> t8 NT51' doesn't have t6. Wait, in the rules, I see that 't6' is present in the grammar as a terminal? Wait, 't6' appears in NT33 -> t6, or is it a terminal? Wait, let's check all rules.\n\nLooking at each rule, I see that NT14 -> t5, NT24 -> t3?, actually, no. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me go through all the 't' entries.\n\nSo, I see:\n\nNT3 -> t3\nNT13 -> t3\nNT6 -> t4\nNT20 -> t4\nNT2 -> t5\nNT27 -> t6\nNT5 -> t2\nNT9 -> t3\nNT10 -> t3\nNT4 -> t2\nNT54 -> t3\nNT17 -> t5\nNT30 -> t4\nNT32 -> t1\nNT52 -> t2\nNT33 -> t3 and t6 (Wait, there's a rule NT53 -> t6 NT21 and another rule NT53 -> NT12 t23, but also NT33 -> t6)\nNT57 -> t5\nNT58 -> t4\nNT40 -> t3\nNT12 -> t19 NT41\nWait, looking again, I don't see any terminal t6. So maybe t6 isn't present, which would mean the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see any production for a non-terminal that directly produces t6. So if the string contains t6, which it does, then the grammar doesn't have that terminal, so it's impossible for the string to be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I missed a 't6' rule.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT28 -> t7? No, NT28 -> t7 is given by NT28 -> t7? Wait, no, let me see the rules again.\n\nThe rules include:\n\nNT30 -> t4\nNT32 -> t1\nNT33 -> t3 and t6\nNo NT rule produces t6 as a terminal. Therefore, t6 is not present in the grammar, which means any occurrence of t6 in the string would make it invalid.\n\nHence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains t6, which is not present in the grammar's terminals.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-555","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t5 t0 t4 t5 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t0 t5 t2 t4 t4 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t1 t2` and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst off, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can go to a terminal. The given grammar has rules where each non-terminal produces two non-terminals except for some that produce terminals. My grammar seems to terminate some non-terminals into terminals like 't5', 't2', etc.\n\nThe string I'm supposed to check consists of a sequence of these symbols. Now, thinking about how to approach this, I recall that since it's a context-free grammar, one way to determine if the string is in the language is to use the CYK algorithm. But with 35 symbols, that might be a bit involved, but maybe manageable if I can outline the process.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is given in CNF, each production rule produces exactly two symbols, so the string's length should be a power of 2. Wait, let me check the length of the string. Let's see: the string is given as a series of `t` and numbers. Counting each `t` as a symbol, the length is 35? Wait, no, each element is a token, so each `t` followed by a number is a symbol. Let me count again. The string is \"t5 t0 t4 t5 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t3 t0 t2 t3 t5 t2 t4 t0 t0 t5 t2 t4 t4 t0 t4 t5 t0 t0 t1 t2\". Breaking it down, it's 35 symbols because each segment is a single symbol, right? So, the string has 35 symbols. \n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols in the string must be equal to 2^(n) - 1 where n is the number of steps, but wait, that applies to the initial step where the start symbol is broken down into two, then each of those into two, etc. So, starting with S, which produces two non-terminals, each of those can produce another two, so the total number of symbols (non-terminals and terminals) grows as 1 (start) \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 8 \u2192 etc. So, the total length of the string should be 2^(n) where n is the number of derivations. But wait, in our case, the string is length 35, which is not a power of 2. The closest powers are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). 35 is 32 + 3, so it doesn't fit. Does that mean the string cannot be derived from the grammar?\n\nHmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think differently. The total number of symbols in the string would be the number of non-terminals and terminals. In CNF, each step doubles the number of symbols. So, starting from S, after one step, you have two symbols. After two steps, four, then eight, sixteen, thirty-two, etc. But 32 is 2^5, so 32 would be length 32. Then 33-35 would be beyond. Since the string is length 35, it's not matching any 2^n. So, perhaps the grammar can't produce this string because of the length issue.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe my initial understanding is incorrect. Let me double-check. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is for a non-terminal to two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So, each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, but that's if all the current non-terminals are split each time. However, in the end, after a certain number of steps, you may have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. Maybe there's a way to have a string where some non-terminals are further expanded, leading to a total number that's not a power of two.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you fully derive the start symbol, every non-terminal has been expanded to terminals. So, the total number of symbols should be exactly 2^n where n is the number of steps required to expand the start symbol into the leaves. But if the input string isn't a power of two, it can't be generated. So, in our case, 35 isn't a power of two. So, the answer would be No, unless I'm missing something.\n\nBut wait, the grammar is given, so maybe I should test with smaller strings first to see if it's possible. Let me check the grammar to see how it starts. The start symbol S goes to NT28 NT17. So, it's two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT28: it goes to NT17 and NT7. So, each time a non-terminal like NT28 is expanded, it's producing NT17 (which could be a terminal or a non-terminal) and NT7 (which again can be a non-terminal or terminal). Let's see what NT17 produces: in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't5' or NT14 NT58. Wait, so NT17 can be a terminal or two non-terminals. Similarly, NT7 has multiple productions, some of which are terminals, others non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with S, then splits into NT28 and NT17. Let's consider the NT17 can produce terminal 't5' or go further. If it goes to 't5', then that's one token. But if it goes further, say, to NT14 and NT58, and so on, each step can add more symbols. But the overall count depends on each expansion.\n\nLet me try to see what the root production is. S \u2192 NT28 NT17. NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. NT17 can be t5 or further. NT7 can be t2, or go to NT2 NT19, or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to see that the string length of 35 is not a power of 2, so no. Because each step of the derivation in CNF increases the number of symbols as a power of two. So 35 is 32 + 3, which is more than 32 but less than 64, but it's not a power of two, so it's impossible.

{"custom_id":"request-576","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't5', 't2', etc. My task is to figure out whether each of these tokens corresponds to a production in the grammar until the end in a leftmost derivation or something similar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar seems to consist of a set of non-terminals (like S, NT57, NT30, etc.) with productions. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t5, t2, etc.\n\nEach production is in the form of a non-terminal (NT) on the left, and on the right, it's either two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is binary, either two non-terminals or a single terminal, which should be okay because CNF allows productions to terminals.\n\nLooking at the given string, it's a series of 34 tokens: t5 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t4 t3 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t0 t4 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3 t2 t0 t4 t3. That's a lot, but maybe I can find a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built from a certain structure. Since the grammar starts with S -> NT28 NT17, maybe the string is built up from expanding S, then NT28, then NT17. So maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each part corresponds to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that correspond to each production rule. Let's try to figure out the components step by step.\n\nFirst, observe the initial part: t5 t2 t0 t4. Looking at the productions, I need to see where 't5', 't2', and 't0' come into play. The non-terminals that lead to these terminals might be helpful.\n\nLooking through the productions, 't5' comes from NT30, NT29, NT53, etc. Wait, 't5' is produced by NF11 -> 't5'. No, wait, looking back: for example, NT9 -> 't3', NT17 -> 't5', NT27 -> 't6', etc. Wait, let me re-examine the productions.\n\nWait, the last part of the grammar, I see NT17 -> 't5', which might help. Also, NT27 -> 't6', and other terminals.\n\nWait, given that T5 is in various non-terminals, perhaps 't5' is generated by some non-terminals. For example, looking at NT28's production: NT28 -> NT17 NT7. Then, NT28 would be divided into NT17 and NT7. NT17 -> 't5', so that's 't5' as the first token.\n\nThen, NT7 has several productions. For example, NT7 -> NT13 NT30, among others. If NT7 is split into NT13 and NT30, then NT13 could be 't4'? Let me check: NT13's productions include NT13 -> NT1 NT7 and NT13 -> NT45 NT26. Wait, but NT1 is NT58 NT41, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this as a parsing problem. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser could work, or a simple top-down approach with a queue.\n\nWait, let's see: The string starts with t5. Which non-terminals produce t5? Looking through the productions, for example, NT30 -> NT44 NT8, but I don't see 't5' being produced directly by that. Wait, let's list all the productions and see which ones result in terminals. For example, NT17 -> 't5'.\n\nSo, the first token is t5, so that must come from NT17. So the production is NT17 -> 't5'.\n\nThen, looking at NT32: NT32 -> NT46 NT1, not helpful. Or, wait, S -> NT28 NT17. So the overall structure starts with NT28 and NT17.\n\nSo, the start is S -> NT28 NT17, meaning that the string should be derived as NT28 followed by NT17, which would be the breakdown of the string into parts corresponding to these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t5, which is from NT17, so the rest would be the expanded NT28.\n\nSo the string is t5 followed by S's NT28 expansion. Let me see:\n\nIf S is divided as NT28 followed by NT17 (from S -> NT28 NT17), then the string is divided into [t5] [expansion of NT28].\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's starting with t5, which is the first part of NT17. Then the next part is t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4.\n\nSo the string is t5 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t5 ... etc.\n\nAfter the initial t5 (from NT17), the next part is t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4, which should correspond to the expansion of NT28.\n\nSo let's check what NT28 produces. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, NT28 must first expand into NT17 followed by NT7.\n\nTherefore, after t5, the next parts should be NT17's expansion followed by NT7's expansion. But wait, the entire string is one sequence, so after t5 comes the rest.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nS starts as NT28 NT17. So the overall string will be the expansion of NT28 followed by the expansion of NT17.\n\nThe string starts with t5, which matches NT17 -> 't5'. So the rest of the string (from t2 t0 t4 ...) should correspond to the expansion of NT28, which is NT28 -> NT17 NT7.\n\nSo, the expansion of NT28 should generate sequences that match its decomposition into NT17 and NT7.\n\nSo, after the initial t5, the rest is the expansion of NT28's two components: NT17 and NT7.\n\nBut let's look at the string: t5 t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 t3 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5 t4 t5 t4 t3 t4 t2 t0 t3 t4 t3 t0 t4 t4 t5 t2 t3 t3 t2 t0 t4 t3.\n\nAfter the initial t5, the next tokens are t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4 ... etc. So the next part after t5 is t2 t0 t4 t5 t4 t2 t2 t0 t4... up to, I think, 15 tokens? The full string after t5 is 33 tokens, but that's getting too long to track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parse the string step by step, expanding each non-terminal as I see it.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string:\n\nThe entire string is a sequence of tokens: [t5, t2, t0, t4, t5, t4, t2, t2, t0, t4, t3, t5, t5, t0, t4, t5, t4, t5, t4, t3, t4, t2, t0, t3, t4, t3, t0, t4, t4, t5, t2, t3, t3, t2, t0, t4, t3].\n\nLet me consider this as the result of a leftmost derivation:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT28 NT17 (so two non-terminals to expand)\n\n- Expanding NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So now we have NT17 followed by NT7.\n\n2. NT17 is already a terminal ('t5'), so that's processed, and NT7 comes next.\n\nNow, after 't5', the next part should come from expanding NT7.\n\n3. NT7 has multiple productions: for example, NT7 \u2192 NT13 NT30, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT48, etc.\n\nLet me pick one production for NT7.\n\nLooking at the string after the initial t5, the next token is t2, which is 't2'. Let's see where 't2' comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 't4' NT51.\n\n- NT32 \u2192 't1' NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is pretty complex with a bunch of productions, and the string to check is quite long. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has specific rules, like each production being either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to understand how the non-terminals expand into terminals or other non-terminals. The target string is made up of t3, t5, t4, t0, etc. These are terminals, so I should look for which non-terminals can directly produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that there are several productions that produce terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT2 NT19, but wait, NT2 is 't5' because in the last part, NT2 \u2192 't5'. So, when I see NT7 in a derivation, it can produce 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has a production NT5 \u2192 NT43 NT24, and looking further, NT43 \u2192 NT7 NT43, which seems recursive. That might need to be handled carefully. Also, NT24 \u2192 NT53 NT43, and NT53 has productions like NT53 \u2192 NT12 NT23 and NT53 \u2192 NT6 NT56, which themselves have further productions.\n\nThe target string starts with 't3 t5 t0 t0...'. Let's break this down:\n\n- The first symbol is 't3'. I need to find a production for 't3'. Looking at the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 and NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT6. Wait, no, 't3' is a production of NT13\u2192NT45 NT26. Or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Wait, the terminals like t3 are produced by specific non-terminals. Let me check:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't5', NT3 \u2192 't3', but wait, the string starts with t3, so I think the first symbol should come from a production that leads directly to 't3'.\n\nWait, let's parse the string: the first part is 't3 t5 t0 t0...'. So the first symbol is 't3'. Looking at the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT6. That doesn't seem to produce 't3' directly. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals. Let me go through each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't3' is produced by several non-terminals, like NT13 \u2192 NT45 NT26, but looking deeper, NT13 has a production to NT53, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see terminals like 't3' appear in NT3 \u2192 't3', and 't5' appears in NT5 \u2192 't5' and NT27 \u2192 't1', but that's 't1' not 't5'.\n\nWait, let me check each terminal:\n\n- 't0' is produced by NT0?\nWait, in the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't5' but no, looking at the grammar, NT0's production is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0, or other productions. Wait, maybe NT15 \u2192 't0'?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT15 \u2192 NT3 NT7, which seems to produce 't0' only if NT3 \u2192 't0' and NT7 \u2192 't0'. Let me check NT3.\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 and NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT6. Hmm, does NT19 or NT55 produce terminals? Looking at NT55, I see NT55 \u2192 NT29 NT54. NT29 produces 't5', and NT54 produces 't3' and other stuff. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions are either binary (A\u2192BC) or terminals. So the derivation tree for the string must have a leftmost derivation that reduces the start symbol S through a series of productions to the string.\n\nThe string is: t3 t5 t0 t0 t4 t5 t2 t4 t0 t4 t5 t4 t3 t5 t0 t4 t3 t0 t4 t5 t4 t0 t4 t3 t5 t0 t3 t0 t3 t5 t5 t4 t2 t5 t5 t0 t4 t5\n\nThat's a lot of symbols. Let's think about the grammar's start symbol, S, which is S \u2192 NT28 NT17. So the first part of the string must come from NT28 and NT17.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't5' (from NT17 \u2192 't5'), so the first symbol t3 must come from NT28.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, so when we look at the first production of NT28, it's NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7. So the first two non-terminals are NT28 and NT7. Wait, no, wait: S \u2192 NT28 NT17, which produces t3 followed by t5, which matches the first two symbols. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the first symbol is t3. So NT28 must produce t3, but looking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, which is two non-terminals, so in the derivation, we'd have NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7, which are two steps. So the output is two symbols: t5 (from NT17) and t3 (from NT7? Wait, NT7 can produce t5 via some path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me clarify: the grammar is S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first part is NT28, which produces the first symbol, which is t3, then NT17 produces t5. So that would require that NT28 \u2192 t3 and NT17 \u2192 t5. But in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 't5', so that's fine. But does NT28 produce t3 directly?\n\nLooking at NT28's productions:\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33\nNT28 \u2192 NT20 NT26\nNT28 \u2192 NT44 NT14\nNT28 \u2192 NT32 NT40\n...\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal. Oh, so I was wrong earlier; NT28 doesn't produce a terminal directly. Instead, it splits into two non-terminals, which must then produce the terminals in the string. So S \u2192 NT28 NT17, so the first two symbols come from NT28 and NT17.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t3, so perhaps NT28 must derive to produce t3 as its leftmost symbol. But looking at the production of NT28, all of them are two non-terminals, so it's a binary production. Therefore, the first symbol comes from the first non-terminal in NT28's expansion, which is, say, NT17 or another.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me list the first few symbols to see if they can fit.\n\nThe string starts with 't3 t5 t0 t0...'. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT28 NT17.\n\nFor the first symbol, 't3', it comes from NT28. Looking at NT28's productions, which produce a terminal:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 NT17 NT7: so NT17 produces 't5', so this would be the first symbol 't5', which doesn't match 't3'. So that can't be the first expansion.\n\nNext, NT28 \u2192 NT14 NT33: but NT14 is a non-terminal. So that's two symbols, perhaps 't5' from NT14 and something from NT33.\n\nBut wait, NT14's productions: let's check.\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT53 NT5: NT53 can produce 't2' as we'll see, and NT5 produces 't5'. So NT14 \u2192 't2' 't5'?\n\nNot sure. Maybe I'm getting too confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should start from the top: the target string starts with t3, so the first non-terminal must produce t3.\n\nLooking through the grammar to find a non-terminal that directly produces 't3'. In the grammar, there's:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT19 NT55 and NT3 \u2192 NT55 NT6. Wait, that doesn't produce 't3', so maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps 't3' is produced by some non-terminal that's further down. For example, looking at NT27 \u2192 NT17 NT27 and NT27 \u2192 NT4 NT3. So if NT27 is in the expansion, it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
