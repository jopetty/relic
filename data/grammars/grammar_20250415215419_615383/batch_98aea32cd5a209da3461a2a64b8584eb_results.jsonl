Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the rules seem to fit that, except for the terminals \"t\" and numbers attached to them.

I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S -> NT88 NT26. So, S expands into two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26.

Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I think I should understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, two non-terminals, or a single non-terminal on both sides. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of S, NT, and terminal symbols like 't' followed by numbers. Wait, the terminals start with 't', probably followed by numbers or maybe even letters? Wait, the string to check is 't12 t6', so it's definitely using terminals like 't12' and 't6'.\n\nThe start symbol is S, so I need to see if the string can be derived from S through the productions. The string is 't12 t6', which is two terminals. So, the grammar must have a way to produce these two terminals in sequence.\n\nLet me see the productions for the terminals. I notice that several non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT72 -> 't32', NT7 -> 't2', and so on. But 't12' and 't6' are also present as direct terminals. That seems odd. Wait, do we have NT12? Looking through, I see NT12 -> NT17 NT54, NT54 -> NT13 NT90. Hmm, but in the direct terminals, I don't see 't12' or 't6' as endpoints. Wait, maybe I have to check again.\n\nWait, the direct terminals I see are like 't4', 't53', 't6', etc. So for 't12', I need to find a production that leads to it. Let me look through the grammar for 't12'. Hmm, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly becomes 't12'. So probably, a non-terminal must be expanded into something that produces 't12'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT72 -> 't32' and NT12 -> NT17 NT54. So NT12 is broken down into NT17 and NT54. Hmm, if I can expand NT17 and NT54 further, maybe they can reach 't12' and something else.\n\nWait, let's look for 't12' in the productions. Wait, in the terminals listed, I see 't72' is produced by NT72. Also, NT54 -> 't13' and 't55'. Wait, but 't13' is another terminal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by looking at the string 't12 t6' as two tokens, meaning the grammar must produce a derivation where S can be broken down into two steps, producing t12 and t6 in order.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which typically uses two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So the first step would be S -> NT88 NT26. So S is split into two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. Then, each of these can be further split according to their productions.\n\nSo let's see NT88 and NT26. \n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\nNT75 -> NT55 NT79\nNT55 -> NT52 NT6\nNT52 -> NT48 NT98\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18\nNT2 -> NT87 NT70\nNT87 -> NT76 NT35\nWait, this is getting a bit long. Maybe I should look for a path that leads to 't12' and 't6'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the string and see if it can be matched by the grammar. Since the string is two terminals, perhaps each is produced by separate non-terminals that eventually lead to a terminal.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible expansions. For 't12', maybe it's generated by expanding NT12 into NT17 NT54. Then, NT17 can produce 't29' and 't42', perhaps leading down to 't12' somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the NT12 production: NT12 -> NT17 NT54. Let's see what NT17 and NT54 can do.\n\nLooking at NT17: It has two productions, one is NT17 -> NT63 NT50 and another is NT17 -> NT42 NT87. Wait, I see in the grammar that NT17 is also present again as NT17 -> NT54 NT83. Wait, the user provided the grammar with multiple entries for NT17?

Let me list them:\n\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58\n- NT70 -> NT12 NT12\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87\n- NT17 -> NT54 NT83\n- And another line: Wait, the user provided a list where some non-terminals are assigned multiple productions.

So maybe it's a typo and NT17 has only two productions, but in the provided grammar, it's listed three times. That might be a mistake, but I'll proceed carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user provided some productions twice by accident. For our purposes, perhaps NT17 has two productions: one leading to NT63 and NT50, and another leading to NT42 and NT87, and another leading to NT58 and NT83? But that would violate the uniqueness required in CNG, so it's unclear. Maybe it's better to consider that NT17 has multiple productions, but the ones that lead to 't12' are the ones that matter.\n\nWait, in any case, in the string 't12 t6', the first token is 't12' and the second is 't6'. So, I need to see if the grammar can derive 't12' and 't6' as the two top-level terminal symbols.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S->NT88 NT26. So S is split into NT88 and NT26.

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if the string `t8 t17` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I remember Chomsky normal form requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that form because all the non-terminals on the left side have right sides that are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAlright, first step is probably to figure out if the string `t8 t17` can be derived from the start symbol, which is S. The string has two parts: `t8` and `t17`. So I need to see how those terminals can be produced from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the production rules for t8 and t17, I see that:\n\n- `t8` is produced by NT8 \u2192 t8\n- `t17` is produced by NT17 \u2192 t17\n\nWait, no, looking again: Wait, the NT17 productions are:\n\nNT17 -> NT63 NT50\nNT17 -> NT42 NT87\n\nBut how do those produce `t17`? Because looking further down, there's a rule NT40 -> t6, NT50 -> t38, and NT35 -> t44. Hmm, maybe I need to backtrack from the string.\n\nWait, the string is `t8 t17`, which are two separate terminal symbols. So each of these must come from terminal productions. So for `t8`, the only terminal production is NT8 \u2192 t8. But wait, in the given grammar, the only production for NT8 is NT88 NT26. That's a non-terminal production, so how does `t8` come from that?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the grammar again. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. NT88 is a non-terminal, so it must eventually produce the string parts. So the string is `t8 t17`, which is two terminals, but in the start symbol's first production, there are two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. These must somehow produce the two `t8` and `t17`.\n\nWait, that can't be right because each non-terminal should expand to a sequence of terminals or non-terminals. So for the string `t8 t17`, which is two terminals, the grammar's first production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 would require that each NT88 and NT26 expand to a sequence that when combined gives two terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT88 and NT26 each produce a single terminal, but looking at the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 and NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. These are non-terminals, meaning they need to expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to see how the symbols `t8` and `t17` can be derived. So the string is `t8 t17`, which has two parts. So to generate this, starting from S, which becomes NT88 NT26. Each of these NTs needs to produce a terminal part.\n\nWait, but NT88 is NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which are two non-terminals. So NT8 produces t8 (since NT8 \u2192 t8). Similarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Where do these go?\n\nLooking at NT68, its production is NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 is NT54 \u2192 t16, and NT28 \u2192 t56. Wait, but `t16` and `t56` are not present in the string we're evaluating. Hmm, something's off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong productions. Let's see, the string is `t8 t17`. So we need to find a way that S can produce t8 followed by t17. But S's first production is NT88 NT26, so NT88 must produce t8 and NT26 must produce t17.\n\nBut NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. How does NT8 produce t8? NT8 \u2192 t8, yes. So NT88 would produce t8, and then NT32 needs to produce nothing else because after t8 comes t17. But NT32's production is NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42, which are non-terminals. So that's a problem because that would add more symbols, not terminals.\n\nSo maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe S's production isn't applicable directly for the string `t8 t17`. Alternatively, perhaps S can derive into more than two symbols, but the string we have is only two, so it must be that after expansion, the non-terminals in NT88 and NT26 somehow collapse into the required terminals without adding any more symbols.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the string is two symbols, so each must come from a direct production. But the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, so each must expand into the correct terminal. But looking at NT88 and NT26, they both expand into two non-terminals each. So that would require four non-terminals, leading to four symbols, but the string is only two. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string `t8 t17` might not be in the language because the start symbol produces two non-terminals, which would each have to produce one terminal, but they themselves require more non-terminals to expand, leading to a longer string than two symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar's production rules. Let me review the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\nNT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\nNT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18\nNT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\nNT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\nNT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94\nNT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\nNT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\nNT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50\nNT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33\nNT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48\nNT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\nNT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\nNT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40\nNT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83\nNT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90\nNT13 \u2192 NT85 NT40\nNT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\nNT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58\nNT48 \u2192 NT59 NT98\nWait, there are two productions for NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87 and NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50, as well as NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87 again. That's redundant but okay.\n\nSo, for the string `t8 t17`, perhaps each non-terminal in the S production must produce a single terminal. But looking at NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which would then need to produce t8 and something else. But that's two non-terminals, which would expand further, making the string longer than two symbols.\n\nWait, but the string has two symbols, so maybe each non-terminal in S's production is a single terminal. But NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals, so they can't directly produce t8 and t17 because they themselves expand into more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to have NT88 produce t8 and NT26 produce t17 without expanding further. But looking at NT88's production, it's NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So NT88 cannot produce just t8 if NT32 also needs to produce something, unless NT32 somehow doesn't need to expand. But that can't be because NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, so NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. If NT68 \u2192 t54 NT28 (from NT54 \u2192 t16 and NT28 \u2192 t56), that would add more symbols beyond t17. But the string is `t8 t17`, only two, so perhaps it's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some rules. Let me look for any non-terminal that directly produces t17. Looking through the production rules:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t17: NT42 \u2192 t18? Wait, no, looking again, it's t18 for NT42. NT17 \u2192 t17? Let's check.

Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminal strings. This structure helps in analyzing the derivation because each production represents a step where two symbols combine, potentially leading to the string.\n\nThe given string is `t60 t11 t16`. So, it's a sequence of three terminals. Since each production in the grammar combines two non-terminals, I might need two steps to combine three symbols.

Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should build the parse tree and see if it can generate the string.

{"custom_id":"request-26","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string \"t30 t23 t19\" can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large with a bunch of non-terminals and production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in a CFG in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except when B or C is a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in standard CNF, a production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. But here, looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to be A \u2192 BC where both B and C are non-terminals, except for the ones ending with terminals like \"t\". So it's clear that terminals are single characters, so each production either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string I'm given is \"t30 t23 t19\". Splitting this into tokens, it's three separate terminals: t30, t23, t19. So I need to check if each of these can be derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nLet me look at the production rules starting with the terminals. Since the top-level rule is S -> NT88 NT26. So S produces NT88 and NT26. Each of these are non-terminals. So the first step is to see how NT88 and NT26 can be expanded, and each of their expansions should lead to the corresponding terminal sequence.\n\nLooking at NT88: The rule is NT88 -> NT8 -> t29. Wait, no, let's double-check. Looking through the production rules, NT88 is only mentioned once. Wait, no, the grammar starts with S -> NT88 NT26, so the first production of NT88 is NT88 -> NT8.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the production for NT88 is actually in the list: looking for NT88, I see:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 -> t29.\n\nWait, NT88 -> NT8, and NT8 -> t29. So NT88 leads to 't29'.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT26: The production is NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo the string starts with NT26, which expands to NT68 NT13. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to expand further.\n\nNT68 is a non-terminal that expands to NT54 NT28. Then NT54 is another non-terminal, and so on. I think I need to build a parse tree to see if the string \"t30 t23 t19\" can be generated.\n\nBut let me think about the structure. The initial symbol is S, which splits into NT88 and NT26. So the entire string must be generated by expanding NT88 and NT26 into their respective terminals, concatenated together. So the resulting string will be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, the string given is \"t30 t23 t19\". So let me break it down into t30, t23, t19. Three parts, but S's expansion is two parts: NT88 and NT26. So this might be a problem because S's first expansion gives two non-terminals, meaning the string should have two terminals, each derived from those two non-terminals. But here, we have three tokens, which suggests that maybe S would have a longer expansion, but wait, S's production is fixed: S -> NT88 NT26, so the string derived from S should have exactly two components.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe I should verify the productions again. Let me check the production rules for S. No, looking through, S has only one production: S -> NT88 NT26. So everything after that comes from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, the string should consist of exactly two terminal symbols, one from NT88 and one from NT26. But in the given string, there are three terminal symbols: t30, t23, t19. That's three, not two. So that seems like a problem. Because S expands to two non-terminals, which then expand to terminals, so the string should have two tokens, but we have three. So this might be an immediate 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe one of the non-terminals can expand to two terminals, and the other as well, leading to more than two tokens? Let me think.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production either results in two non-terminals or a terminal. So if NT88 expands to t29, that's one terminal. NT26 expands to NT68 NT13, which each would expand further. Let's see:\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 -> NT8 -> t29.\n\nNT28 -> t25, which is a terminal. Wait, no: looking back, NT28's production is NT28 -> t25.\n\nWait, wait: Let me check the NT28 rule. In the list, I see NT28 -> t25. So NT28 is a terminal. So NT68 expands to NT54 and NT28, which is nt54 and t25.\n\nNT54 -> NT8 -> t29.\n\nSo NT68 would become t29 t25 when fully expanded.\n\nSimilarly, NT13 has multiple productions. Let's see, one of the NT13 productions is NT13 -> NT58 NT83. Let me check that. So NT13 can go to NT58 NT83, which themselves expand further.\n\nLooking at NT58: NT58 -> NT33 NT4.\n\nNT33 is a terminal t33.\n\nNT4: Looking at the productions, NT4 -> NT20 NT22.\n\nNT20 -> NT51 NT72.\n\nSo NT20 would expand to NT51 and NT72, which are non-terminals that go on further, eventually reaching terminals.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, is there a way for NT13 to expand to a terminal in a single step? Let me check the rules for NT13.\n\nLooking through, NT13 has several rules:\n\nNT13-> NT7 NT69\n\nNT13-> NT58 NT83\n\nNT13-> NT85 NT40\n\nNT13-> NT13 ... Wait no, it's different. Wait, looking again:\n\nNT13: \n\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69\n\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83\n\n- NT13 -> NT85 NT40\n\n- NT13 -> NT53 NT33\n\nWait, so NT13 has four different production rules. Let's see if any of them produce just a single terminal.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n1. NT13 -> NT7 NT69: Both non-terminals.\n\n2. NT13 -> NT58 NT83: Both non-terminals.\n\n3. NT13 -> NT85 NT40: Both non-terminals.\n\n4. NT13 -> NT53 NT33: Both non-terminals.\n\nWait, but looking further, I see:\n\nNT53 -> 't48' (a terminal). So NT53 is a terminal. Similarly, NT33 is 't33' (terminal). Wait, but that's just me checking further down.\n\nWait, in the initial productions, I don't see NT13 -> 't' directly. So perhaps the only way to get a terminal from NT13 is through a series of production steps, which would complicate things.\n\nSo, putting this together, the S production is S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 -> NT8 -> 't29' (a single terminal).\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 -> NT8 -> 't29'.\n\nNT28 -> 't25'.\n\nSo, NT68 would become 't29' 't25'.\n\nThen, NT13: if it's expanding to NT58 NT83, which are both non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4.\n\nNT33 is 't33'.\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22.\n\nNT20 -> NT51 NT72.\n\nNT51 -> 't39' (a terminal).\n\nNT72 -> 't33' (terminal) or other?\n\nWait, this seems way too deep and may generate multiple terminals beyond what's in the string. But the point is, S's expansion would generate something like 't29' followed by some longer sequence from NT26, leading to more than two terminals, but our string has three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S expands to two non-terminals, each of which expand to multiple terminals. So the overall string could be more than two, but let"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is \"t1 t55 t20 t19\". I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to methodically figure this out.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. However, in the provided grammar, some of the rules have two terminals, like NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, most of the right-hand sides are two non-terminals. Wait, no, for example, NT88 has two non-terminals, NT63 and NT26, but then NT63 breaks into NT48 and NT87. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the structure.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if any of the rules have two terminals, that might not be a problem as long as the rest follow CNF. But in the given grammar, most rules seem to be of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, which is allowed in CNF because each right-hand side is two non-terminals. However, some have rules like NT98 -> NT41 NT40, which is two non-terminals. Wait, no, wait: no, looking again, some rules have more than two symbols on the right? No, wait, no. All the rules seem to have either one or two non-terminals. For example, looking at the beginning, S -> NT88 NT26, which is two non-terminals. Then NT63 -> NT48 NT87, also two non-terminals. Even in the other rules, I see some like NT48 -> 't27' \u2014 wait, that's a terminal, and in CNF, that's allowed as a single terminal production. So in CNF, a production can have a single terminal, but if there are two, they're non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, the string is \"t1 t55 t20 t19\". So each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol, and I guess the question is whether this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through some sequence of productions.\n\nSo to determine if the string is in the language, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing context-free grammars. Alternatively, I can consider the derivation tree.\n\nThe string has four terminals. In CNF, each production step increases the number of symbols by one (since it replaces one non-terminal with two, or one terminal with one, but in our case, it's terminals). Wait, actually, in CNF, each production of a non-terminal either replaces it with two non-terminals or one terminal. So starting from S, the first step would replace S with two non-terminals, which then each can be replaced further. So for a string of length n, the derivation would have n-1 steps, doubling at each step. But maybe that's more detailed than I need.\n\nAlternatively, for the CYK algorithm, which is more practical. Let me try to map where each symbol in the string can appear.\n\nThe string is \"t1 t55 t20 t19\". Let's write them as tokens: t1, t55, t20, t19.\n\nEach token is either a non-terminal or terminal. Terminals are the 't' followed by a number, except maybe some are symbols but in the grammar, we have 't' as a terminal.\n\nThe initial step is to build a table where each cell corresponds to a position in the string and checks for possible non-terminals that can generate a substring starting at that position with a certain length.\n\nBut since I don't remember all the rules in the grammar, maybe it's easier to work backwards, seeing if each token can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nLet's list the rules for each non-terminal that produce a terminal:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking for rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83\n- NT51 -> NT70 NT94\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT91 -> NT2 NT33\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n- NT68 -> NT54 NT28\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83\n- NT14 -> NT66 NT90\n- NT13 -> NT85 NT40\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n- NT7 -> NT87 NT97\n- NT87 -> NT76 NT35\n- NT90 -> NT91 NT68\n- NT98 -> NT86 NT4\n- NT13 -> NT53 NT33\n- NT20 -> NT51 NT72\n- NT18 -> NT66 NT55\n- NT70 -> NT12 NT12 (nt70)\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT73 -> 't27' (this is a terminal)\n- NT50 -> 't53' (terminal)\n- NT40 -> 't6' (terminal)\n- NT42 -> 't18' (terminal)\n- NT11 -> 't4' (terminal)\n- NT17 -> 't29' (terminal)\n- NT55 -> 't8' (terminal)\n- NT18 -> 't47' (terminal)\n- NT90 -> 't56' (terminal)\n- NT75 -> 't60' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't56' (terminal)\n- NT17 -> 't19' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't29' (terminal)\n- NT11 -> 't30' (terminal)\n- NT66 -> 't30' (terminal)\n- NT55 -> 't54' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't54' (terminal)\n- NT72 -> 't32' (terminal)\n- NT12 -> 't17' (terminal)\n- NT8 -> 't6' (terminal)\n- NT97 -> 't4' (terminal)\n- NT94 -> 't57' (terminal)\n- NT51 -> 't39' (terminal)\n- NT2 -> 't36' (terminal)\n- NT91 -> 't44' (terminal)\n- NT18 -> 't26' (terminal)\n- NT12 -> 't23' (terminal)\n- NT72 -> 't23' (terminal)\n- NT94 -> 't23' (terminal)\n- NT54 -> 't16' (terminal)\n- NT13 -> 't12' (terminal)\n- NT59 -> 't15' (terminal)\n- NT72 -> 't38' (terminal)\n- NT58 -> 't28' (terminal)\n- NT98 -> 't45' (terminal)\n- NT88 -> 't37' (terminal)\n- NT86 -> 't9' (terminal)\n- NT83 -> 't52' (terminal)\n- NT33 -> 't1' (terminal)\n- NT28 -> 't25' (terminal)\n- NT48 -> 't27' (terminal)\n- NT11 -> 't21' (terminal)\n- NT69 -> 't27' (terminal)\n- NT50 -> 't38' (terminal)\n- NT35 -> 't44' (terminal)\n- NT58 -> 't11' (terminal)\n- NT11 -> 't17' (terminal)\n- NT7 -> 't2' (terminal)\n- NT70 -> 't11' (terminal)\n- NT53 -> 't48' (terminal)\n- NT72 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-34","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string `t38 t6 t54 t36` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Alright, where do I start?\n\nFirst, let's recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. Each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is always a single non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it starts with S, which is the start symbol. The first rule is S -> NT88 NT26. So, S produces NT88 and NT26. Since NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals, we need to expand them further.\n\nNow, the next step is to see what each of these non-terminals expands to. Let's take NT88 first. According to the rules, NT88 -> NT8 N32, wait, no, the given rules don't have NT88 directly. Wait, looking carefully, the initial rule says NT88 -> NT8? Wait, no, looking again: \n\nWait, the grammar provided starts with S -> NT88 NT26. Then later, looking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT78 -> NT33 NT79, but wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see: the user provided a list of grammar rules as a multistory thing, but in text it's hard to parse. Wait, but looking carefully, after S comes NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, no, S directly goes to NT88 NT26, which I think is S expands to NT88 followed by NT26. So to expand S, we need to expand NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking through the list of production rules, let's find NT88: I see that NT85 -> NT17 NT58, and then NT58 -> NT68 NT18. Wait, but NT68 isn't directly in the string, though it's in the rules. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to process the string `t38 t6 t54 t36`. Each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build a parse tree from the top down, as the grammar is CNF. Let's see:\n\nThe string has four tokens: t38, t6, t54, t36.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production rule has two non-terminals, except leaves which are terminals. So for a string with four terminals, the parse tree would have three expansion steps beyond S.\n\nWait, in Chomsky normal form, each step produces two symbols, so to get four terminals, you'd need two splits plus some terminals. Maybe a bit unclear.\n\nAlternatively, to generate the string, we can think of it as a series of substitutions where each non-terminal is expanded into two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) until all the non-terminals are exhausted, leaving only terminals.\n\nSo starting with S, which expands to NT88 NT26. Then each of those must be expanded into their own rules.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for NT88. Wait, looking through the list, I don't see NT88 anywhere. Wait, let me recheck the provided grammar:\n\nWait, the first rule is S -> NT88 NT26. Then I see production rules for NT77, NT7, etc. But I don't see any rule for NT88. Wait, that can't be right\u2014probably a typo in my understanding. Maybe NT88 is NT8, as a typo.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar, perhaps the rule is S -> NT88 NT26, but looking through the provided rules, I don't see NT88 having a definition. So that's odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a different number. Wait, maybe the rules are too long and hard to parse correctly, but I'm missing NT88 in the later rules.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, after NT58 -> NT33 NT4, then NT90 -> NT91 NT68, and NT75 -> NT33 NT79, etc. I don't see NT88 or NT26 being further defined, except in specific products. Wait, wait, in the rules, I see NT28 -> 't56', which is a terminal. But perhaps I'm missing the rules for NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, maybe the rules are as follows: looking at the list, I see some rules, but perhaps the user messed up in the initial list\u2014maybe S's production is S -> NT88 NT26, and then looking for production rules for NT88 and NT26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial rule is S -> NT88 NT26, and then NT88 and NT26 produce other non-terminals.\n\nWait, if S is the start symbol, then it expands to NT88 and NT26. Each of these must expand further. So perhaps NT88 and NT26 each produce two non-terminals, and that continues until we reach terminals.\n\nBut looking through the rules, I don't see any NT88 or NT26 being defined. For example, is there a rule like NT88 -> NT54 NT16? Or maybe NT88 being split into other symbols.\n\nWait, looking again through the rules, I see NT54 -> NT16 NT13, NT50 -> 't53', NT13 -> 't29', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps NT88 and NT26 each produce two non-terminals that then produce terminals. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should try to parse the string from the bottom up.\n\nLooking at the string: t38 t6 t54 t36.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so in the parse tree, these would be leaves. Since it's four terminals, the parse tree must have a structure that can produce four symbols.\n\nIn a context-free grammar with leftmost derivation or top-down parsing, each step would produce two symbols. So starting from S, you have two non-terminals, each of which may themselves have two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, if a non-terminal A produces B and C, and B produces t38, and C produces t6, then S initially produces A and B. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the string length. It has four symbols, which would require S, then each step expanding into two non-terminals, three steps in total. For example:\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nThen, if NT88 expands into, say, X and Y, and NT26 expands into Z and W, so at step 2, we have X Y Z W.\n\nThen, each of X, Y, Z, W needs to expand into terminals or non-terminals, but since we have four symbols, each step could be terminal.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at the symbols and see if they can be derived from the productions.\n\nLooking at t38: according to the given rules, NT58 -> 't33' 't4', but also NT58 -> NT33 NT4 earlier.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT58 has two options: NT33 NT4 or t33 (as terminal). Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT35 -> NT55 NT58\n- NT58 -> NT11 NT18 (wait, earlier I thought it was 't33' 't4' but maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Let me look again: in the given list, one rule is NT58 -> NT33 NT4, another is NT58 -> t33 t18\u2014wait, but looking at the user's list, under NT58: \"NT58 -> NT33 NT4; NT58 -> NT11 NT18\"?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the user wrote:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\nNT58 -> NT11 NT18.\n\nSo NT58 can either produce NT33 NT4 or NT11 NT18, or in some cases terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. Let me check again:\n\nThe provided grammar has:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\nNT58 -> NT11 NT18.\n\nBut where are the terminals? Because in the user's list, sometimes a production is like NT35 -> t44.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see for example:\n\nNT50 -> 't53'\nNT55 -> 't8'\nNT58 -> 't33' t4. So that's a rule where NT58 can expand to the terminal t33 and t4.\n\nWait, but in the other rule for NT58, it says NT58 -> NT11 NT18.\n\nSo for NT58, the options are either NT33 and NT4, or NT11 and NT18, or the terminals t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. The grammar consists of a set of production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) can be rewritten in terms of other non-terminals and eventually terminals. The terminals appear when a non-terminal is replaced by a specific symbol (like 't' followed by a number).\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t47, t54, t39, t25, t19. Since this is a string, each token is separated by a space, so we can consider each part as a separate terminal symbol. \n\nStarting from the start symbol S, which has the production rule S -> NT88 NT26. So S is two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. To expand S, each of these must eventually derive a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nSo starting from S, we get NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13. Now, each of these non-terminals can be further expanded.\n\nLet's take each of these and see what they can derive:\n\n1. NT8: Looking at the rules, NT8 isn't listed on the left-hand side of any production. Instead, I see entries like NT8 -> 't29'. So NT8 can be replaced by 't29'.\n\n2. NT32: Checking the rules, NT32 -> NT73 NT42. Both NT73 and NT42 are non-terminals that can be further expanded.\n\n   - NT73 -> NT75 NT83\n   - NT58 -> NT33 NT4 (wait, not NT73)\n   Wait, no, NT73's production is NT75 NT83.\n\n   NT75 -> NT55 NT79\n\n   NT55: Checking the rules, NT55 has two productions: NT55 -> NT14 NT20 and NT55 -> NT52 NT26? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> NT14 NT20 (Line 77: NT55 -> NT14 NT20)\n- NT55 also has another production: NT55 -> NT52 NT26? Wait, no, let me check another line. Oh, wait, Line 70: NT55 -> NT54 NT18\n\nWait, no, that's for NT58. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- Line 70: NT55 -> NT14 NT20\n- Line 73: NT51 -> NT39 NT53\nWait, no, NT55's rule is in line 70: NT55 -> NT14 NT20.\n\nSo NT55 can produce NT14 NT20. Then NT14 -> NT66 NT90 (Line 106: NT14 -> NT66 NT90), and NT90 can be NT91 NT68 (Line 99: NT90 -> NT91 NT68). NT91 -> NT2 NT33 (Line 100), and NT2 -> NT87 NT70 (Line 55: NT2 -> NT87 NT70). NT70 can produce nt12 nt12 (Line 89: NT70 -> NT12 NT12). So wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string we have: one of the parts is t54, t39, etc. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string, the second part is t54. Let's see where t54 comes from. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4 (Line 61: NT58 -> NT33 NT4)\n- NT28 -> NT56 (Line 66: NT28 -> NT56)\n- NT40 -> 't6' (Line 84: NT40 -> 't6')\n- NT88 -> 't37' (Line 67: NT88 -> 't37')\n- NT86 -> 't9' (Line 82: NT86 -> 't9')\n- NT51 -> 't39' (Line 75: NT51 -> 't39')\n- NT42 -> 't18' (Line 102: NT42 -> 't18')\n- NT54 -> 't16' (Line 104: NT54 -> 't16')\n\nWait, so NT54 can be 't16'. So maybe at some point, a production will derive t54, but I don't see NT54 deriving anything else except a terminal. Wait, no, looking back, I think I made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT14: line 106 says NT14 -> NT66 NT90\n- NT66 -> NT56 (line 93: NT66 -> NT56)\n- NT56 is generated when? NT56 is from NT40 (line 84: NT40 -> 't6'), but wait, NT56 is for NT28 (line 66: NT28 -> NT56), and NT56 -> 't'... let me check NT56's rule. I don't see NT56 in the left-hand side of any production, but looking at the rules, maybe NT56 can be generated by some other rule? Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see NT56 on the left, except in NT28 and NT58. So NT28 -> NT56, and NT58 can be NT28 and NT4.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe a better approach is to try to work backwards from the string and see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nThe string is t47, t54, t39, t25, t19.\n\nLet's start with the entire string and try to split it into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe entire string is 5 tokens: [t47][t54][t39][t25][t19].\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT88 NT26. So the initial expansion is NT88 NT26.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must produce a sequence of terminals when fully expanded.

{"custom_id":"request-59","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t28 t12 t33 t20 t32` is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies parsing. Each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar rules to see what each non-terminal can expand into. The string starts with `t28`, which seems to be a terminal. In the grammar, I spot a rule `NT28 -> 't28'`, so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, breaking down the string step by step:\n\n1. **t28**: Directly from `NT28 -> 't28'`.\n2. **t12**: Looking for NT12. In the grammar, I see `NT12 -> NT87 NT35`. So, t12 comes from NT12, which is two symbols. Hmm, but t12 is a single symbol. Wait, no, t12 is the terminal itself. So, the NT12 rule is used to split t12 into two symbols, but since t12 is a terminal, does that mean NT12 must directly produce it? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the grammar's NT rules are non-terminals, so each rule is a production for a single non-terminal. So, for NT12, the production is `NT12 -> NT87 NT35`. So NT12 can only produce the combination of NT87 and NT35. But t12 is a terminal, so that's conflicting. That suggests that t12 might be derived from NT12 via those productions, but if t12 is a terminal, then NT12 must produce only 't12', which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the grammar again. Let me list the relevant rules:\n\nLooking at NT12: `NT12 -> NT87 NT35`.\n\nBut in the string, we have t12, which is a terminal. So in the parse, the NT12 symbol must be expanded into two symbols, but in the string, it's a single 't12'. That seems like a problem because the grammar doesn't directly produce 't12' as a single terminal. So maybe the string can't be derived with this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a rule where NT12 \u2192 't12'. Let me check all the rules again. Looking through the list:\n\n- I see entries like NT28 \u2192 't28', NT48 \u2192 't27', NT58 \u2192 't11', etc. But I don't see any rules where NT12 \u2192 't12'. So that suggests that NT12 can't directly produce a terminal. Instead, it can only produce a combination of two non-terminals, which would then have to be expanded further.\n\nSo if the string has `t12`, but the NT12 rule doesn't produce 't12', that might mean it's impossible to derive that string from the grammar. However, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check NT12 again. The grammar's NT12 rule is `NT12 -> NT87 NT35`, which means it's a combination of NT87 and NT35. So to get 't12' in the string, it must expand to something that includes 't12' directly, but the rule doesn't allow it.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The NT12 can only produce 'something', so to get 't12', the grammar has to have a production that directly yields 't12', which isn't present. Therefore, the string can't be generated because NT12 can't be transformed into a single 't12' terminal. It can only produce two non-terminals that need to be expanded, leading to more symbols, not terminals.\n\nLet me verify this by looking at the string more closely: `t28 t12 t33 t20 t32`. So each token must be either a terminal produced directly by a non-terminal or part of a composite production. Since t12 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal as a single terminal, this suggests it's impossible. Therefore, the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-70","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t52 t44 t52 t39 t26 t2`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar also includes start symbols and terminals. Each production only has two parts on the right side.\n\nI look at the grammar provided. It has a bunch of non-terminals that eventually derive into terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by a number. My string only has 't' terms, so I need to see if the grammar can generate these specific 't's.\n\nI think the strategy would be to parse the string from the start symbol S. Since S is the top symbol, the string should be derived from S through a series of replacements. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S in the grammar: S -> NT88 NT26. So S produces two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. Each of these needs to eventually become 't's in the string.\n\nI'll check what NT88 and NT26 produce. \n\n- NT88: From the grammar, looking for production rules with NT88 on the left. I see NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So NT88 can only go to NT8 and NT32.\n- NT26: There's a rule NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo now, the string is broken down into NT8 NT32 NT44 NT52 NT26. Wait, no, the string is `t52 t44 t52 t39 t26 t2`, so I think I need to track how the non-terminals derive these terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\n1. The string is `t52 t44 t52 t39 t26 t2`, which is six tokens. So the derivation should result in six terminals. Starting from S, which splits into two non-terminals, that would take us to level 1 as S-> NT88 NT26. Each production step increases the number of non-terminals by one, so for n symbols, we have n-1 productions. Since the string has 6 symbols, it would take 5 productions, each splitting a non-terminal into two. So the derivation tree must have 6 leaves after 5 splits.\n\nBut wait, each production in CNF always splits a non-terminal into two, so the total number of symbols in the string would be 2^k, where k is the number of productions applied. Hmm, but this might complicate things because 6 isn't a power of 2. Wait, that suggests that the string might not be in the language because the count of symbols could be problematic. Or maybe I'm confusing the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by combining intermediate non-terminals that eventually produce the required terms. But I'm not sure. Let's try a different approach: reverse engineering the string.\n\nI need to see if each 't' in the string is produced by some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, each 't' is directly derived from a non-terminal. For example, NT90 -> NT91 NT68, and so on. So each 't' is the result of a direct production, meaning that some non-terminal directly produces a 't' without splitting further.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\n1. t52: I need to find a production rule where the non-terminal on the left ends up as 't52'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4 \u2192 but 4 is 't4', not 58.\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20 \u2192 14 is NT14, doesn't produce t52.\n- Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT52 does not appear as a terminal. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT33 -> 't1', NT28 -> 't25' etc., but 't52' isn't directly produced by any rule I can see. Or is it?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT55 -> 't52'?\n\nWait, no, let me check each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT17 -> 't29'\n\nNT33 -> 't1'\n\nNT28 -> 't25'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT55 -> 't52'?\n\nWait, let me look:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT55 -> 't54' (No), NT58 -> 't28', NT50 -> 't38', etc. Wait, looking for 't52':\n\nLooking at NT79 -> NT22 NT48, which would output 't48' because NT48 is 't27' but no, wait NT48 is 't27'? Let me check:\n\nI see:\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18\n\nYes, and then NT18 -> 't47', so NT48 would produce 't47'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't52' is produced by a different rule. Let me go through each rule to see if any directly produce 't52'.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal symbol, I see:\n\n- NT11 -> 't4'\n- NT17 -> 't29' and 't19'\n- NT55 -> 't52' (Hmm, no, I think I misread earlier. Wait, let me check the rule for NT55.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT55 -> 't52' \u2192 Oh, yes, line says NT55 -> 't52'.\n\nOkay, so NT55 can produce 't52'.\n\nSimilarly, for each token in the string, I need to find if each 't' can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me list each token and see:\n\n1. t52: produced by NT55.\n2. t44: Looking for a production that results in 't44'. Let me check the rules for 't44'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-term where their production ends up directly as 't44'. Hmm, maybe 't44' is produced through a chain.\n\nWait, actually, the rules involve left-hand sides, and maybe the question is whether there's a path from the start to each of these terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a CYK parsing algorithm approach, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, another way is to check if the string can be generated by the grammar step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is S->NT88 NT26.\n\nSo after the first step, we have NT88 NT26.\n\nThen, each of these non-terminals needs to be split:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nNow, the string is NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13.\n\nThen, each of these needs to be split:\n\nNT8: Looking at the rules, NT8 isn't a starting non-terminal. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, S is the starting symbol, and the others are non-terminals. So NT8, NT32, etc., may have their own productions.\n\nLooking at NT8: Is there a rule where NT8 is on the left side? Looking through the rules:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT8 -> ... So perhaps NT8 is a terminal? But in the grammar, non-terminals are on the left of the rules, so if NT8 is on the left, it's a non-terminal. If it's not on the left, it's a terminal. So if NT8 is a terminal, it must be on some right-hand side, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT8 being a terminal. Wait, no, the first symbol is S, which is a non-terminal, but after derivation, we have NT8, which is non-terminal, unless it's replaced by terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to map each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree would help, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down as follows:\n\nt52 t44 t52 t39 t26 t2.\n\nEach 't' corresponds to a non-terminal that can derive that 't'.

I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar has some terminals, like 't27', 't53', etc. Each production has specific links. For example, NT7 -> NT11 NT22, but also some NTs directly go to a terminal like 't4'. \n\nLet me try to parse the string. Each 't' must come from a terminal production. So starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t48: In the grammar, looking at the productions, NT48 can produce 't27' or 't29' or other 't's. Wait, looking at the rules, NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. Then NT2 \u2192 't36' and NT18 \u2192 't47'. So NT48 \u2192 't36 t47' would produce t36 t47. But in the string, I have t48 as the first token. Hmm, that's conflicting. Or maybe NT48 can also produce other terminals. Let me check all production rules for NT48. From the given rules, NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. I don't see NT48 producing any terminal directly. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the string has t48 as the first token, but in the grammar, I don't see how to get t48 directly. So this could be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the tokens wrong. Let me list the tokens again: t48, t12, t53, t36, t55, t56. Each is a separate token, so the parse tree must have these terminals in order.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo the first step is to produce NT88 and NT26. Let's look at each of them.\n\nNT88: Looking at the rules, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So NT88 is broken down into NT8 and NT32.\n\nNow, each of these needs to produce something.\n\nFirst, NT8 \u2192 't29' or 't27'? Looking back, in the rules, NT7 \u2192 't2', but wait, I'm looking at NT8. From the list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT8 in the rules. I see NT90 \u2192 't91' but not directly NT8. Wait, let me go through.\n\nWait, from the given rules, I don't see any production for NT8 other than something that might involve terminals. Let me search through the rules for NT8.\n\nWait, looking at the provided list, I don't see NT8 being rewritten into terminals. Wait, perhaps I misread. Let me check:\n\nLooking through each production: \n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed NT8. Let me go through the rules again. \n\nLooking carefully: I see NT7 \u2192 't2', NT58 \u2192 't28', NT40 \u2192 't40' (but as NT40 is a non-terminal, perhaps derived from other productions). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check where 't48' comes from.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. So NT48 produces two non-terminals. And from earlier, NT2 \u2192 't36', and NT18 \u2192 't47'. So if we have NT48 producing 't36 t47', but in the string, the first token is t48. That doesn't align. So perhaps t48 is a terminal, but I don't see a production for NT48 that directly results in 't48'. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me check again for NT48.\n\nYes, in the given rules: \n\nNT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n\nNo direct terminal. So how can t48 appear in the string? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, but wait: The string is `t48 t12 t53 t36 t55 t56`. So the first token is t48. Let me see how that could come about.\n\nWait, unless the derivation produces a terminal before the non-terminals, but in the given grammar, NT48 doesn't produce any terminal. So that's confusing. So perhaps the starting symbol S would never produce a terminal like t48. So the string starts with t48, which isn't allowed by the grammar.\n\nWait, but wait, I might have misread the NT40 or other NTs. Let me check NT88.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S expands NT88 and NT26, which each have their own productions. Let me try to model this as a parse tree.\n\nBut let me first check: Can any of the non-terminals directly produce a 't' token?\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see some of them directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't29'\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'? Wait, wait: I'm looking through the rules, and I see:\n\nFor example, looking for NT with directly terminal productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking through the rules for each NT:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2' and 't4', etc.\nWait, going through each NT:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT58 \u2192 't33', because NT58 \u2192 NT14 NT20 and NT33 is a terminal?\nWait, no: NT58 \u2192 't33'? Wait, no.\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't1' (Wait, in the list, I see NT53 \u2192 't48', NT35 \u2192 't44', etc.)\n\nWait, looking for any production where a NT directly goes to a terminal.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 't33' (No, NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79)\nWait, in the rules: NT77 doesn't produce a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, NT12 \u2192 't17' or 't12'? Looking through:\n\nWait, here's a production: NT58 \u2192 't33'\n\nNo, looking through, I see NT59 \u2192 't15', NT28 \u2192 't56', etc.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4. NT33 is a terminal \u2192 't1'; NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22. So NT58 \u2192 't1' followed by some NTs.\n\nWait, but in the given rules, I don't see any NT directly producing a terminal except in cases where perhaps NT58 \u2192 't33' is a terminal? Or is it that NT33 \u2192 't1'?\n\nLooking back, I think I'm mixing up. The rules are all in the form NTa \u2192 NTb NTc or NTa \u2192 terminal.\n\nSo for example, NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79, so it's not a terminal. But somewhere else, is there an NT that produces a terminal? I see:\n\nFor instance, NT59 \u2192 't15', but wait, in the rules, it's NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20, which are non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing any terminals except maybe 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the rules are structured. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the entire list of production rules:\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't...':\n\n- NT74 \u2192 NT70 NT4? Not seeing.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the NTs directly produce a terminal. That would mean that the entire start symbol S, and all its descendants, can only produce non-terminals and thus no actual terminal tokens. But in the string, we have several 't's. That's conflicting.\n\nIf that's the case, then the given string can't be generated by the grammar because there are no terminal productions.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, all productions are of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the ones that produce terminals. Some of these productions have a terminal on the right-hand side (like NT7 -> NT59 NT58 't2'), while others don't, like NT73 -> 't27'.\n\nThe string consists of seven tokens, all of which are terminals. Each token is a two-digit number, except 't' followed by a number, which I assume corresponds to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: 't47', 't55', 't12', 't17', 't9', 't23', 't38'.\n\nI'll need to see if there's a derivation starting from S and ending at the given string. The approach is to work backwards, checking if each terminal can be derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads back to S.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string has seven tokens, so the parse tree should have a structure that builds up to seven nodes. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step adds exactly one non-terminal, so the height of the tree will correspond to the number of steps to reach the terminals.\n\nStarting from the root S, which is NT88 NT26. So each of these must be expanded into the respective non-terminals, which in turn lead to the terminals.\n\nBut let's see: S is NT88 -> NT88 NT26, right? Wait, no, in the grammar, S is NT88. Looking back: the first production is S -> NT88 NT26. So S is NT88, which splits into NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, expanding into two non-terminals. So S is a single non-terminal, specifically NT88, which expands into NT28 NT26. Or wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26: No, in the initial grammar, the first production is S -> NT88 NT26. Wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, the first is S -> NT88 NT26. So S must produce NT88 NT26. So the first two symbols in the string must come from NT88 and NT26.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is 't47', which is a terminal, so it must come from a production that includes a terminal. Let's check which non-terminals have terminals in their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, many of the productions have a terminal on the right. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58 't2' (probably 't22')\n- NT18 -> NT66 NT55 't47'\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70 't36'\n- NT22 -> NT44 't33'\n- NT41 -> NT49 't49'\n- NT40 -> NT60 't60'\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58 't2' (probably 't29')\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50 't29'\n- NT55 -> NT52 't54'\n- NT13 -> NT85 NT40 't15'\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT94 't23'\n- NT87 -> NT76 NT35 't44'\n- NT94 -> NT57 't57'\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18 't18'\n- NT50 -> NT38 't38'\n- NT33 -> NT1 't1'\n- NT28 -> NT25 't25'\n- NT48 -> NT27 't27'\n- NT72 -> NT33 't1'\n- NT76 -> NT55 't55'\n- NT22 -> NT44 't30'\n- NT91 -> NT23 't23'\n- NT12 -> NT17 NT94 't23'\n- NT72 -> NT33 't1'\n- NT54 -> NT16 't16'\n- NT13 -> NT12 't12'\n- NT59 -> NT15 't15'\n- NT72 -> NT38 't38'\n- NT58 -> NT28 't28'\n- NT98 -> NT45 't45'\n- NT88 -> NT8 't8'\n- NT54 -> NT16 't16'\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT40 -> 't60'\n- NT20 -> 't20'\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me map out the productions that produce terminals:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26: So the root S is NT88, which produces NT28 't25' and NT26. But NT26's productions are NT68 NT13. So in the root, we have NT28 and NT26 as the first two symbols.\n\nWait, no: Wait, S is a single non-terminal that produces NT88 NT26. So when expanding S, it becomes NT88 and NT26. Each of these can be non-terminals that further expand.\n\nBut the string starts with 't47', which must come from some production that includes a terminal. Looking at the list, 't47' appears in NT18: NT18 -> NT66 NT55 't47'. So if somewhere a NT18 is derived, it leads to 't47'.\n\nLooking at the string, the second token is 't55', which could come from NT55 or another production. Let's see, NT55 has a production NT55 -> NT52 't54'. But in the string, it's 't55' after 't47', so perhaps NT55 is directly producing 't55'. Is there a production for NT55 that ends with 't55'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT55 producing a terminal. The closest is NT55 -> NT52 't54' or NT55 -> NT54 't54', but none of these end with 't55'. Wait, I might have missed it. Let's check the list again.\n\nAh, in the grammar: NT55 -> NT52 't54' and NT55 -> NT54 't54'\u2014both lead to 't54', not 't55'. So there's no direct production of NT55 to 't55'. Hmm, so perhaps 't55' is derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. The string is t47 t55 t12 t17 t9 t23 t38. So the third token is 't12'. Let's see: NT12 has production NT55 -> NT15 't15' or NT13 -> NT58 't15'... Wait, perhaps NT12 is derived from another path.\n\nLooking for 't12', it's present in NT12 productions: NT12 -> NT17 NT94 't23'. So if NT12 is derived, it would produce 't23', but that's not matching the third token 't12'. Hmm, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps I should try to find the parse tree structure by considering the sequence of tokens and seeing if each can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me attempt to build the parse tree step by step, starting from the string.\n\nThe string is: t47 t55 t12 t17 t9 t23 t38.\n\nI'll consider the possible splits into sub-expressions.\n\n1. The entire string must come from the start symbol S, which is NT88 -> NT28 't25' | ... Wait no, S is NT88 -> NT28 NT26. So perhaps the first two non-terminals expand to form the first few tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is split into parts that each come from a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to check each token and see if it can be obtained from a production, working backwards.\n\nLet's list the tokens: t47, t55, t12, t17, t9, t23, t38.\n\nWe can try to see if each token can be part of a production chain starting from the root S.\n\nBut considering the tree structure, it's helpful to model possible splits.\n\nFor instance, the root is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-96","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. The string in question is `t8 t18 t16 t28 t11 t33 t15`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. The start symbol is S, and all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, yes, all the productions are either two non-terminals (like S \u2192 NT88 NT26) or terminals, as some rules have the terminal 't' followed by numbers. So this is indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string we're evaluating is `t8 t18 t16 t28 t11 t33 t15`. Each token here is a terminal symbol, presumably derived from the grammar's terminals. The grammar has rules like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22 and others, and some NT rules directly produce a terminal (e.g., NT72 \u2192 't32'). So some non-terminals in the grammar produce a terminal, which is t followed by a number.\n\nThe string is a sequence of seven tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of a string starts with the start symbol S, and each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, eventually leading to the terminal string. The number of tokens in the string is equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree, which, for a derivation starting with S, should be 2^n where n is the number of steps after the initial S. But wait, in this case, the string length is 7, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that's interesting because for a binary tree, the number of leaves is a power of two. So maybe a string of length 7 can't be derived from S if it's in CNF because S starts as NT88 NT26.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see: The initial rule is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S expands into two non-terminals. Each of those can be either NTs or terminals. But in this case, both NT88 and NT26. I need to check what NT88 and NT26 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see NT88 listed as a non-terminal. Wait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So NT88 is a non-terminal. Then I need to find the production for NT88. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT88 in the list. The list seems to go up to NT99, but I don't see NT88. That's a problem because in CNF, each non-terminal should have a production. If NT88 isn't defined, then it can't expand further, meaning S can't be derived. But in the string, the first token is t8, so maybe NT88 produces 't8'?\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules. The first line is \"S -> NT88 NT26\". So NT88 must have a production rule. Let me scan through the grammar rules to see if NT88 is present. Scanning through, the NT88 isn't listed. Hmm, that's a problem because if NT88 isn't defined, then the start symbol can't derive 't8' as the first token. So perhaps the string is \"No\" because S can only produce two NTs, and if NT88 and NT26 don't have any terminals, then the string cannot start with 't8'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed the production for NT88. Let me go through the list again. \n\nLooking through the list, I see rules like NT88 \u2192 ...? Wait, no. I don't see any production starting with NT88. There is NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79, NT7 -> NT11 NT22, etc. But no NT88. So that suggests that NT88 doesn't have a production, making it undefined. Therefore, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which would not produce any terminal, meaning that the first token in the string cannot be t8 because it would require NT88 to expand into a terminal, which it can't do.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the notation. Maybe the rule S \u2192 NT88 NT26 is written as S \u2192 A B, where A is NT88 and B is NT26. So for S to produce a terminal, both A and B would have to produce terminals. But since NT88 isn't defined, A can't produce a terminal. Therefore, S can't produce a terminal as its first expansion. So the first token 't8' can't be part of any derivation starting from S because S's first expansion is two non-terminals, and at least one of them (NT88) doesn't have a production, meaning it can't derive a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string starting with 't8' should not be in the language, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So I'm confused. So the NT4 is producing t20 and something else. But wait, t20 is a terminal in the string, so perhaps it's a child of NT4, but NT4 \u2192 t20 NT22, meaning that NT22 is then a non-terminal that must generate some string.

Hmm, this might take a while, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the only terminal symbols in the productions are 't's followed by numbers. So, any production that doesn't have a non-terminal on the right side is directly outputting a 't' string.\n\nThe string we have is `t25 t26 t15 t47 t12 t23 t57 t49`. It's a sequence of 8 terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each 't' in the string must correspond to a production that directly outputs that terminal. So, each 'tX' must be a result of a production of the form A -> tX, where tX is a single terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I need to check if each 't' symbol in the string is directly produced by some non-terminal. Let's go through the string step by step.\n\n1. **t25**: Check the grammar for any production that produces t25. Looking through the productions, I don't see any. The productions for non-terminals starting with T are limited. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, in the grammar, I see a production NT73 -> NT75 NT83. Hmm, that doesn't help. Or NT48 -> NT2 NT18, but that's two non-terminals again. I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces t25.\n\nWait, looking for any rule that ends with t25, but all the rules either lead to other non-terminals or specific terminals. For example, looking at the list, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces t25. The only 't' symbols are tied to specific non-terminals, like NT28 -> t56, etc. So t25 doesn't appear as a terminal in any production. Hmm, that seems problematic.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the grammar again. Scanning through all the production rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t25. So that's a problem because each terminal in the string must come directly from a production.\n\nIf t25 isn't produced by any production, then the string can't be generated because there's no way to derive 't25'. So, maybe the answer is no, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the grammar. Let me recheck. For instance, NT75 -> NT86 NT99... Wait, no, that's not it. Or NT28 -> t56, but not t25. So, yeah, t25 doesn't appear as any terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the derivation uses a chain where a non-terminal expands into others, and eventually, one of them outputs t25. But in CNF, each step produces only two non-terminals at a time, unless it's a production that includes a terminal.\n\nWait, no. Each step can only expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to get 't25', there must be a production where that non-terminal directly expands to a terminal 't25'. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSince I don't see any such production, t25 can't be part of any derived string. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overlooking something. Let me go through all the productions again. For example, NT48 -> t27, so that's a terminal, but maybe another rule like NT73 -> t25? But I don't find that. The rules for NT28 produce t56, but not t25.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to say that the string has t25, which isn't present as a terminal in any production.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it gives a specific structure that makes certain parsing techniques like CYK possible, but maybe I don't need to use those here. Instead, perhaps I can use a more manual approach, breaking down the string and the grammar step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar better. The grammar consists of a series of production rules. Each non-terminal (like S, NT63, etc.) leads to two other non-terminals until we get to terminals (indicated by single quotes). My goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe given string is: `t57 t29 t47 t29 t57 t8 t6 t54 t2`.\n\nI need to find a sequence of derivations that turns S into this string. Let's start by looking at S.\n\nFrom the grammar, S starts as S -> NT88 NT26. So the string must start with the concatenation of NT88 and NT26. Let's decode these:\n\nNT88 is the production that leads to 't37' (since one of the rules says NT88 -> t37). NT26 leads to 't2' (NT26 -> t2). So the first two symbols should be t37 and t2, but the string starts with t57, which is different. Hmm, that doesn't seem to match. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Perhaps the initial step isn't S -> NT88 NT26, but maybe S is derived into NT88 and NT26, and those in turn produce other terms. Let me think: the string starts with t57, so perhaps the first part is NT88 -> t57.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT40 -> t6. NT28 -> t56, NT17 -> t29, etc. Wait, NT40 is a non-terminal that produces t6. Hmm. Let me check if any non-terminal leads to t57. Looking through the rules, I see NT8 -> 't29', NT11 -> 't4', etc. Wait, no, I don't see t57 directly. Wait, let's look for the production rules that include t57.\n\nWait, actually, in the production rules, I see NT94 -> t57. So NT94 produces t57. So maybe the string starts with NT94. But wait, how does that connect back to S? Let me see: S is defined as NT88 NT26, so the start string must derive from those. Oh, I see. NT88 -> t37, which is 't37', but perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong initial expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Each non-terminal can be either another non-terminal or a terminal. So S is NT88 NT26, both of which are non-terminals. So the string must start with the results of deriving NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their terminal outputs:\n\n- NT88 -> t37\n- NT26 -> t2\n- NT40 -> t6\n- NT40 is also used in other rules, like NT13 -> NT40, NT88 -> etc.\n\nWait, but the initial string is t57 t29 t47 t29 t57 t8 t6 t54 t2. So perhaps the first part is derived from NT13, which can lead to t57 because NT13 -> NT58 or other terminals. Wait, wait, let's check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT13 -> NT7 NT69\n\nNT7 -> t2\n\nNT69 -> t27\n\nSo NT7 -> t2 and NT69 -> t27, so NT13 would derive to t2 t27, which is t2 and t27, which is \"t2 t27\".\n\nBut in the string, the first part is t57. So perhaps I'm looking at the wrong starting point. Wait, perhaps the string starts with the production of NT8.\n\nWait, no, let me think again about S.\n\nS is S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo both NT88 and NT26 must be derived from the start. So the string must be built by concatenating the results of deriving NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo the first element of the string should be the first symbol of NT88's derivation, and the second should be the first symbol of NT26's derivation.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT88 -> t37, so the first symbol would be t37. But the string starts with t57. That's a problem. That would suggest that the initial derivation is not possible, right?\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding how the derivations work. Let me check NT88 again. Oh! Wait, perhaps I'm missing a rule where NT88 can derive into something else. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT88 -> t37 (so 't37')\n- Also, looking back, is there any other rule for NT88? Let me see: the rules list starts with S, then NT42, NT7, etc. Wait, I don't see another rule for NT88 except NT88 -> t37. So NT88 can only produce 't37'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> t2. So the first two symbols of the string would have to be t37 followed by t2. But the string starts with t57, which is different. That suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the initial expansions don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that S must expand first. Maybe there's a way to expand non-terminals through multiple steps. But in a proper CFG, the derivation must proceed from S, so the next symbols after the first would depend on the production of the first non-terminal, and so on.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the string is a substring somewhere else in the production, but that's unlikely because the string is being checked as the entire language.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains a different path. Let me see: maybe I should look for another way to reach the string.\n\nWait, maybe the string doesn't start directly with S's expansion but arises through other rules. But S is the start symbol, so it must be the first expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar, and the non-terminals can be chained in a way that allows the initial symbols to be generated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps NT88 doesn't necessarily produce 't37' every time; maybe there's a different production I'm missing. Let me check the rules again for NT88.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT88 -> t37\n\nNo other production for NT88. So NT88 can only derive to 't37'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> t2.\n\nSo the string must start with t37 followed by t2. The given string starts with t57, so that's a mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the initial symbols don't match the start productions.\n\nWait, is there any other way? Perhaps the grammar can generate 't57' through a different initial path, but S's first expansion is fixed as NT88 and NT26. So unless there's a different way for NT88 to start with t57, which there isn't, the string cannot be generated.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because the initial symbols don't match.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by recalling what Chomsky Normal Form means. It's a way to represent context-free grammars where each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that many of the non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals. For example, NT88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t29. Wait, no, actually looking again, the non-terminals like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, and then NT11 might produce a terminal. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me list out the rules more carefully.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. So S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Now, I need to see what NT88 and NT26 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT88: its production is NT8. Because NT88 \u2192 NT8. So NT88's production is just NT8. Then NT8's production is... looking back, I see NT88 \u2192 NT8, but for NT8 itself, looking through the rules, the only NT8 I see is in the production of NT58: NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT4. Wait, that's not NT8. Let me check again. Wait, actually, maybe I misread. Hmm, looking at all NT production rules, I don't see an explicit production for NT8. Except in some places like NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT4, but that's not NT8. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me scan through the rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT8 doesn't seem to be a direct non-terminal, except in NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33, but that's not relevant. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe NT8 isn't a terminal. Wait, in the rules, I see NT88 \u2192 NT8, which suggests that NT88 is a non-terminal that produces NT8. But I don't see a production for NT8 beyond that. Wait, perhaps the rules are such that NT8 can produce a terminal. Let me check: looking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, and NT22 \u2192 t44, right? So NT7 produces NT11 and NT22, where NT22 is a terminal 't44'. So NT11 is another non-terminal, with an production, like NT11 \u2192 t4. Or wait, no, looking back: NT11 \u2192 t4? Or does it go further? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see entries like NT8 \u2192 t29, NT11 \u2192 t4, etc. Wait, no, I think that's not the case. Let me look for entries where NTx is a terminal. For example, there's NT22 \u2192 't44', NT28 \u2192 't56', NT4 \u2192 't20', etc. So the terminals are represented with lines like NT22 \u2192 't44' or nt27 \u2192 't27'. \n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see lines like NT59 \u2192 NT15, which isn't a terminal. But also lines like NT35 \u2192 't44'. So NT35 produces the terminal t44.\n\nSo, the string given is t32 t52 t39 t60 t52 t17 t52 t20 t4. Let me break it down into individual tokens: t32, t52, t39, t60, t52, t17, t52, t20, t4. \n\nFirst, the length of the string is 9 tokens. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So to generate the string, each token must come from the productions of these non-terminals.\n\nLet's start by tracing the possible derivations. The first token is t32. Looking at the rules, in the grammar, I see that NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So, t32 must come from a production that eventually reduces to a terminal. Let me see if NT32 can produce t32. But looking at the rules, NT32's production is NT73 NT42, and both are non-terminals. So, how do we get to t32?\n\nWait, looking further, maybe I miscounted. Let me check: in the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 't54', NT48 \u2192 't27', etc. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should approach this systematically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reconstruct possible paths. For example, the first token is t32. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce t32 directly? Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t30\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t26\n- NT55 \u2192 t54\n- NT58 \u2192 t28\n- NT77 \u2192 t60\n- NT79 \u2192 t56\n- NT11 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t29\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, I don't see any direct production for t32, but t32 is part of NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So for NT32 to produce t32, both NT73 and NT42 must reduce to terminals, with the last step being the combination.\n\nWait, but the first token is t32, which would mean that the first step must produce it. But in the grammar, t32 is a non-terminal that's part of NT32, which only produces splits into other non-terminals. So maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the tokens correspond to non-terminals, and each non-terminal can generate multiple tokens through their productions.\n\nWait, no, the string is in terms of terminal symbols, so t32 is a terminal. But looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce t32. So perhaps t32 is produced by a non-terminal, but in the given rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t32.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again: looking for productions that have 't32' as the right-hand side. I see:\n\n- NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40\n- NT55 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90\n- NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68\n- NT66 \u2192 t30\n- NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33\n- NT22 \u2192 t44\n- NT68 \u2192 t56\n- NT54 \u2192 t16\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t26\n- NT32 \u2192 t32? Or does it go further? Wait, no, looking back, I don't see NT32 directly. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT32 with NT33.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 t1 (a terminal), but no, the rule is NT33 \u2192 t1, which is a single terminal. So perhaps t32 is not a terminal, but comes from a non-terminal. But looking through, the only way to get t32 is through NT32, which only can split into NT73 and NT42. So I'm not sure. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token in the string corresponds to a single production. Let's think: the string is t32 t52 t39 t60 t52 t17 t52 t20 t4. Let's see the sequence of non-termials:\n\nSince the start symbol is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Each of these needs to generate their respective parts.\n\nSo, for the first token t32, NT88 and NT26 both must generate sequences. Let's assume that the first token comes from NT88. Since NT88 \u2192 NT8, and then NT8 needs to produce t32. But looking at the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT8 \u2192 t32. So that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token is produced by NT26. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, so t32 would be part of this. Wait, but NT68 is a non-terminal, so it would produce more tokens. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe another approach: build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be derived.

{"custom_id":"request-152","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which helps because each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar's structure. The start symbol is S, which initially generates NT88 and NT26. I'll need to see how each of these can produce terminal strings through a series of substitutions. \n\nLooking at the productions, many of them resolve non-terminals into other non-terminals, and a few into terminal symbols. For example, NT88 \u2192 NT8 and NT32, and NT32 \u2192 NT73 and NT42. Wait, no, actually looking again, I think I made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nWait, the production for NT88 is NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, right? So NT88 is transformed into NT8 and NT32. Now, NT8 might produce something else. Looking for NT8 productions: I see NT88 is one, but also look elsewhere. Wait, in the grammar, the productions for NT8 are in two places. Wait, actually, looking through the list, I only see NT88 as having NT8. Let me check all the productions:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT8's productions. Wait, actually, no, looking at the list provided, I don't see any production for NT8 explicitly deriving into terminals. Hmm, wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the productions listed, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n- NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70\n- NT33 \u2192 NT1 NT ... Wait, actually, let me check all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nWait, I need to figure out how to derive the string from the grammar. The string to check is \"t49 t20 t55 t44 t20 t45 t17 t23 t16 t37\". Let me parse this string into tokens: these are all terminal symbols except for any non-terminals in the grammar, but looking at the grammar, everything seems to be resolved into terminals except some steps involve non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, several non-terminals produce terminals. For example, some have productions like NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79, or NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22. But looking through the entire list, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals, while others produce other non-terminals. \n\nThe approach is to work backwards from the start symbol S and see if the string can be constructed by applying the productions. Alternatively, work forwards from the string to see if it can be reduced by the grammar to the start symbol.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to try to build a parse tree for the given string and see if it can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, the string is 10 tokens: t49 t20 t55 t44 t20 t45 t17 t23 t16 t37. \n\nI need to break this down into parts that match the grammar. Let me consider how to group these tokens into sequences that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbols: t49, t20. Are these the results of any production's right-hand side? Looking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce t's. For example, NT40 \u2192 t6, NT45 \u2192 t, wait, actually I need to look through all the productions to find which non-terminals produce t20, t49, etc.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT45 \u2192 t?\nWait, let me list out the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through the entire list, let's see:\n\nNT48 \u2192 t27\nNT58 \u2192 t11\nNT13 \u2192 t27\nNT50 \u2192 t38\nNT72 \u2192 t33\nNT12 \u2192 t17\nNT8 \u2192 t29\nNT11 \u2192 t4\nNT66 \u2192 t30\nNT55 \u2192 t8\nNT72 \u2192 t33\nNT18 \u2192 t47\nNT90 -> t56\nNT75 -> t60\nNT17 -> t29\nNT55 -> t52\nNT28 -> t56\nNT17 -> t...\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.

Hmm, Chomsky normal form is a specific way the grammar is structured, where each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. That should make parsing easier, but still, figuring out if a string fits is going to take some steps.\n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar and the string. The string to evaluate is `t12 t57 t47 t32 t27 t19 t19 t49 t30 t54`. It has 10 tokens, which are all terminal symbols because they're just individual letters and numbers, like 't12', 't19', etc.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of production rules. I think I need to work backwards, starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the given string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S:\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n\nSo, the first two parts of the string should come from NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet's break it down. The string starts with 't12 t57...', which I'm guessing is from NT88 and NT26. But NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals, so each needs to be expanded until they become terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT88 and NT26:\n\nNT88: S -> NT88 NT26\nBut NT88 and NT26 themselves have other productions.

Maybe I should use the string and see if each 't' corresponds correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build a tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated.\n\nBut maybe another approach is to map each non-terminal to the terminals it can produce.

No, in CNF, the start is the only production at the top, so S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nBut then looking at NT88, do I have any production rules? Let me scan through the list.\n\nI see NT88 -> NT88 NT...? No, actually, looking through the grammar, I think most of the NT symbols have production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-173","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is `t26 t8 t34 t49 t32 t15 t27 t23 t56 t45 t29`.\n\nFirst, I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that in CNF grammars, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the starting symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, no, actually, Chomsky Normal Form requires every production to be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules are like S \u2192 NTa NTb, meaning two non-terminals. But some of them directly produce terminals, like NT7 \u2192 't4'. So this grammar is indeed in CNF because all right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of terminal symbols. My job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules in some way. \n\nI think the best approach here is to model the parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a method similar to the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for such grammars. Alternatively, since the string is not too long, I can try to build a derivation tree or see which symbols can generate the given string step by step.\n\nLet me list the string again: `t26 t8 t34 t49 t32 t15 t27 t23 t56 t45 t29`.\n\nI'll consider each symbol from the beginning and see which non-terminals can produce it, then combine the results step by step.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, `t26`. Looking at the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce `t26`. Let me scan through the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT12 \u2192 t17\n- NT32 \u2192 t73\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT48 \u2192 t27\n- NT72 \u2192 t23\n- NT12 \u2192 t23\n- NT94 \u2192 t23\n- NT58 \u2192 t11\n- NT72 \u2192 t38\n- NT42 \u2192 t18\n- NT13 \u2192 t12\n- NT59 \u2192 t15\n- NT72 \u2192 t33\n- NT76 \u2192 t55\n- NT22 \u2192 t44\n- NT41 \u2192 t49\n- NT2 \u2192 t34\n- NT40 \u2192 t60\n- NT40 \u2192 t60 (another one)\n- NT88 \u2192 t8\n- NT58 \u2192 t11 (but we need t26)\n- NT58 \u2192 t28 (t28 is another symbol)\n- NT11 \u2192 t4 (no)\n- NT69 \u2192 t27\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT70 \u2192 t11\n- NT53 \u2192 t48\n- NT72 \u2192 t33\n- NT76 \u2192 t55\n- NT22 \u2192 t44\n- NT41 \u2192 t49\n\nWait, looking at these, I see NT41 \u2192 t49, which is the fourth symbol in the string. So the fourth symbol is `t49`, which comes from NT41. So in the derivation, we have to consider that NT41 is generating this symbol. So in the parse tree, NT41 must be a node whose children are the symbols before and after `t49`. So before `t49` is `t32`, and after is `t56`. Wait, the string before is t26, t8, t34, t49, so before `t49` is t32. So the left context is t26 t8 t34 t49 and the right is t56, then comes t45, t29.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of building the parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nAnother approach is to see how each symbol is derived. Let's start from the string and see if it can be split into parts that match the production rules.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree step by step. Let me try to list all the possible symbols and their possible sources.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string and see if it can be generated by S.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split in a way that each part is derived from a production.\n\nThe string is: t26 t8 t34 t49 t32 t15 t27 t23 t56 t45 t29.\n\nSplitting it into non-terminal symbols, I'm not sure. Maybe looking for sequences that match the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the string as a series of terminal symbols that must be produced by the grammar. Let's go one by one and see if each symbol can be generated.\n\nStarting with the last symbol, `t29`, let's see what can produce this.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT29 is not present, but perhaps combining smaller steps. Wait, maybe I should check which non-terminals produce `t29`. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 't44't44 is not t29.\n- NT75 \u2192 't60't60 is nt60.\n- NT55 \u2192 't54't54 is nt54.\n- NT18 \u2192 't47't47 is nt47.\n- NT17 \u2192 't29't29 is nt29.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 t29. So `t29` is produced by NT17. So in the derivation, somewhere we must have NT17 generating `t29`. So before NT17, we need symbols that can be derived from NT17. Now, NT17 is a non-terminal, so how is it generated?\n\nLooking at production rules, I see NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT58 or other? Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see:\n\n- NT17 has rules like:\n\n  NT17 -> NT63 NT58\n  NT17 -> NT42 NT87\n  NT17 -> NT90 NT52\n  etc.\n\nWait, but let me check the given rules more carefully.\n\nWait, the rules provided were:\n\nNT17 -> NT63 NT58\nNT17 -> NT42 NT87\nNT17 -> NT53 NT33\nNT17 -> NT90 NT40\n\nHmm, so NT17 can be split into two non-terminals, or is there any production that gives a terminal? Wait, looking through all the rules again, I don't see any rule where NT17 directly produces a terminal. So NT17 cannot produce t29 directly. Therefore, the symbol `t29` in the string must be generated by a non-terminal that can derive to it. Wait, but in the given rules, only NT17 can produce t29 via NT17 \u2192 't29', but actually, looking again, I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go back. Looking at the given rules, the term t17 is actually 't17' \u2192 NT17, but in the rules, I don't see any direct production where a non-terminal produces 't29' directly. So perhaps the `t29` comes from a non-terminal that can derive into something that eventually produces t29.\n\nWait, but another possibility is that there's a longer derivation. For example, let's say we have NT17, which might derive into something that in turn produces t29. Alternatively, perhaps `t29` is part of another production, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules. Looking through the list again, I see:\n\n- NT93 doesn't exist, but nt55 produces t55? Wait, looking again... No, in the rules, I have:\n\nLooking through each rule, for each line starting with \"NTx -> ...\":\n\n- NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT58\n- NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n- NT17 \u2192 NT90 NT52\n- NT16 \u2192 NT13 NT54\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n- NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT72 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n- NT73 \u2192 't52'\n\nWait, no, earlier I miscounted.

{"custom_id":"request-176","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite lengthy, so I need to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The grammar's rules are all of the form A -> BC, except for the start symbol which might have more components, but looking at the given rules, each production seems to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. That confirms it's in CNF. CNF requires that the right-hand side of each production (except maybe the start symbol) has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, but wait, no, CNF allows exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, I think in CNF, the productions are either A -> BC or A -> a, where B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions are of the form A->BC or A->a, so each production has exactly two variables or one terminal. But the given grammar seems to have all productions like A->BC, not A->a, so perhaps the start symbol is S, which may produce multiple symbols. Wait, no, the start symbol S in CNF can produce either BC or a. So perhaps the given grammar is such that every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol, which might have two or, if the start symbol can produce a terminal, but here the S rule is S->NT88 NT26, so that's two non-terminals, so the S production is of the form BC, so maybe all other non-terminals also produce two non-terminals each. Wait, but for a CFG in CNF, any non-terminal can derive a terminal directly, which is the A->a case. So perhaps looking at the grammar, all non-terminals expand into two non-terminals, so there are no terminals in the right-hand sides except those that are terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Wait, perhaps in the grammar, the terminals are 't' followed by numbers, and the non-terminals are starting with 'NT' followed by numbers. So the productions are all of the form NTXX -> NTYY NTZZ, and the leaves are the 't' followed by numbers. So the string we need to evaluate is a series of these 't' strings, each of which is a terminal, and the non-terminals expand into two non-terminals each time.\n\nThe string given is `t34 t34 t26 t1 t37 t9 t37 t25 t18 t45 t25`. That's 11 terms separated by spaces. So the question is, can we derive this string starting from S using the given productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation will double the number of symbols, but in this case, since we're starting with S which is NT88 NT26, each of these can be split, but since they are non-terminals, each will produce two non-terminals, and so on. So the derivation for any string generated by this grammar will have a length that is a power of two, right? Because each non-terminal production replaces one symbol with two, so starting with S, which is two symbols, each step appends the non-terminals, leading to each production doubling the length. So the number of symbols in a derived string must be a power of 2. Let me see the length of the given string: it's 11 symbols. Hmm, 11 is not a power of two (which would be 2,4,8,16,...). 11 isn't 8 or 16, but wait, actually, starting from S, the initial count is 2 symbols. Each production step can cause each non-terminal to produce two non-terminals, so the number of symbols can grow exponentially. However, the string's length might not necessarily be a direct power of two because each non-terminal might produce several symbols, and the order of production might vary. Wait, but actually, in a CFG in CNF, the number of steps to derive a string of length n (where n is a power of two) would require log2(n) steps. But in this case, the string is 11 symbols, which is not a power of two, and 11 is not a triangular number, so it's unclear whether this can be derived from the start. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is incorrect. Perhaps since the start symbol is S, which is a production leading to two non-terminals, the generated strings will have lengths that are powers of two plus some offset, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach is to check whether each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar. So each 't' must be a terminal that is directly derived from a non-terminal. So, for each 't' in the string, I can look up the productions that have that terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the 't's are attached to certain numbers. Let me list all the terminals and their corresponding productions.\n\nFrom the grammar, the right-hand sides that include terminals are:\n\n- NT28 -> 't56' (but wait, looking back, NT28 is 't56'?

The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions, some terminals are present. For example, NT75 \u2192 't60', and others like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT33 \u2192 't1'.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, and terminals only appear in the start symbol. Here, the grammar has both non-terminals (like S, NT88, NT63, etc.) and terminals (like 't27', 't6', etc.). Wait, hold on\u2014it looks like the non-terminals are prefixed with NT, like NT88, NT63, etc. The terminals are the 't' variables followed by numbers, like 't6', 't26', etc.\n\nThe string we're given consists entirely of terminals, which suggests that after expanding the non-terminals in the grammar, we should end up with this string of terminals. So, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT88 NT26. So S can only expand into NT88 and NT26. Let's look at these two:\n\nNT88 -> NT83 NT32\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nSo S expands into NT88 and NT26, which then each expand further.\n\nLet's list all the productions for each non-terminal in the grammar to see their possible expansions. This could get extensive, but maybe we can work step by step.\n\nLooking at NT83: What does NT83 expand into? Scanning through, I see NT83 -> 't27'. Wait, that's a terminal. So that path is just 't27'. But in our string, we have 't16' which isn't 't27', so maybe NT83 isn't the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at this wrong. The string is `t6 t26 t16 t20 t6 t57 t34 t33 t23 t26 t23 t39`. Each is a single terminal symbol.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them, then try to see a possible derivation.\n\nt6:\nLooking at the productions, there are several that result in 't6'. For example, NT90 -> 't6'. Also, NT18 -> 't47', which is different. So 't6' can come from NT90, for example.\n\nt26:\nLooking for 't26' in the productions. I see NT91 -> 't44', which isn't it. Looking for any NT that expands to t26. Maybe the 't26' is a result of a non-terminal. Wait, wait\u2014I see in the productions, NT90 -> 't91' but no, that's the other way around. Hmm, perhaps the 't26' is a result of a non-terminal, but perhaps it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, looking back: NT90 -> 't91'\u2014no, that's a 't91' which isn't helpful. Maybe I should look for which non-terminals expand directly to 't26'. Or perhaps, it's an intermediary step in a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't26' is from NT26. Wait, no\u2014NT26 is an NT and expands to NT68 NT13.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards from the terminals of the string and see if I can find a path through the grammar that allows each step to fit.\n\nThe string is: t6, t26, t16, t20, t6, t57, t34, t33, t23, t26, t23, t39.\n\nLet me try to deconstruct each part.\n\nStarting from the first symbol: t6. Looking at the grammar, which NTs expand to t6? From above, I see NT90 -> 't91', which isn't t6. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nLooking at the list: NT12 -> 't17', NT17 -> 't29', NT18 -> 't47', NT28 -> 't56', NT33 -> 't1', NT22 -> 't44', NT11 -> 't4', NT20 -> 't51', etc. Hmm, perhaps 't6' comes from NT70 -> 't12' but that's different.\n\nWait, let's check each NT that directly produces t6:\n\nLooking through each production, the only NT I see that directly produces a t symbol is NT88 which goes to 't27', which isn't t6. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly.\n\nWait, looking back: the productions are listed as, for example, NT7 -> 't2', so I see that NT7 -> NT87, which eventually becomes 't2'. So perhaps 't6' comes from NT90?\n\nWait, let me re-examine all the productions to see which ones directly produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT58 -> 't28', NT7 -> 't2', NT48 -> 't27', etc. So I'll make a list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT70 -> 't12'\n- NT88 -> 't27'\n- NT90 -> 't56', 't91'\n- Wait, let's find 't6' in the productions.\n\nWait, looking through all the lines, I see NT40 produces 't6': NT40 -> 't6'. So that's one place. So NT40 can produce 't6'. So t6 could come from NT40.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, how do non-terminals expand? S starts as NT88 and NT26, which further expand. So, perhaps S -> NT88 NT26, then NT88 expands to NT83 NT32, and NT26 to NT68 NT13, etc.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to see from the end.\n\nThe last symbol in the string is t39. Let's see which NT can produce t39. Looking at the productions, I see NT51 -> 't39'. So perhaps the last part is from NT51.\n\nSimilarly, the penultimate symbol is t23. Which NT produces t23? Looking, I see NT72 -> 't23' (since NT72 is part of the production that eventually becomes t23 multiple times). Also, NT12 -> 't17' is different. Wait, looking through all productions, maybe NT17: wait, not explicitly.\n\nWait, the production NT17 -> 't29', which isn't helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should outline each symbol and see if I can trace back through the grammar.\n\nLet me list all the parts of the string and try to find possible NTs that can produce them:\n\n1. t6: From NT40.\n2. t26: Maybe NT91.\n3. t16: Looking for, perhaps NT82 or NT40.\n4. t20: From NT90 perhaps.\n5. t6: Again, NT40.\n6. t57: Looking, perhaps NT50 -> 't38' but not t57. Wait, NT58 -> 't28' and 't59', which isn't t57. Hmm. Wait, NT7 -> NT59 NT58, then NT58 could produce 't59' and 't58' further down. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t is a leaf node so each must be generated at the deepest level, meaning each is the result of a single NT that produces that t.\n\nWait, but in the CFG in CNF, each production is of the form A->BC or A->t. So for the string t6 t26 etc., each t is the result of a production that directly outputs a terminal.\n\nTherefore, each symbol in the string must be produced by a non-terminal directly, i.e., in one step. Therefore, each t is from an NT that has a production to that t.\n\nLooking back, for example, t6 is from NT40, so there must be an NT40 in the derivation chain that directly produces t6. Similarly, t26 must come from some NT26, but wait, NT26 is a non-terminal that produces two other non-terminals: NT68 and NT13. So to get 't26', which is a terminal, perhaps that's not possible because in the grammar, 't26' is only produced by NT26 if it had a production to 't26'. But looking at the productions, I don't see NT26 -> 't26'.

{"custom_id":"request-210","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t17 t55 t1 t33 t27 t1 t4 t30 t37 t33 t32 t21 t19\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. In this grammar, some of the rules lead directly to terminal symbols (like 't' followed by a number) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate consists of a series of terminal symbols. My task is to see if these terms can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions provided.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is rewritten as NT88 NT26. So, the initial step would be to expand S into these two non-terminals. Let's write that down:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNow, each of these NTs (non-terminals like NT88, NT26) can be expanded further, either into other non-terminals or terminal symbols. To process the given string, I'll need to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar, following the right expansion path.\n\nStarting with NT88:\nLooking at the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So, NT88 is a combination of NT8 and NT32.\n\nNext, NT8 \u2192 't29' (as given in the grammar). That's a terminal symbol, so that's done.\n\nThen, NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42 (from the grammar). Now, we have to break down NT73 and NT42.\n\nNT73 \u2192 't27' (terminal), and NT42 \u2192 't18' (terminal). So, the expansion of NT88 would be 't29' 't27' 't18', right?\n\nWait, no. The production for NT88 is NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and then NT8 \u2192 't29', NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So, putting it all together, NT88 can produce 't29' 'NT73' 'NT42', but since NT73 and NT42 can further expand, let's process that.\n\nBut maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's not get confused. Let's take the string and see if each token is a direct result of some production.\n\nThe string is: t17 t55 t1 t33 t27 t1 t4 t30 t37 t33 t32 t21 t19.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is separated by space, so it's a sequence of symbols. Since the grammar uses binary productions, each non-terminal in the string must expand into the symbols in sequence, but I need to see if the overall production can chain together.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to build the parse tree step by step, starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nLet's follow NT88 first. NT8 \u2192 't29'\n\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t17, which doesn't match t29. Hmm, that's an issue. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The first symbol is t17, but the first expansion is t29. That doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if t17 is generated by any non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT17 \u2192 't29', 't47', and also other productions. Let me check all the NT17 entries:\n\nLooking through the grammar, yes, NT17 can produce 't29' (from rule: NT17 \u2192 NT53 NT83), 't47' (from NT17 \u2192 't63'...), and 't19' (NT17 \u2192 NT82... but wait, looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules provided, I think I should list all rules for NT17. Let me scan through the provided rules:\n\nLooking for NT17:\n\nYes, two rules:\n\nNT17 -> NT63 NT50\n\nNT17 -> NT42 NT87\n\nNo, those are the two. Hmm, in the given rules, there are several NT17 productions:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n\nWait, but in some versions, you might have more, like NT17 \u2192 't19', but in the given grammar, I don't see that. Let me double-check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT22 NT56\n\n- NT40 \u2192 NT28 NT66\n\nWait, no NT17 \u2192 't19' is present. Let me make sure. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT17 has two production rules: NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50 and NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87. So, it doesn't directly produce 't19' as a terminal symbol. Hmm, so maybe that token isn't generated by NT17.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t17. So maybe I misread. Wait, the string is \"t17 t55 t1 t33 t27 t1 t4 t30 t37 t33 t32 t21 t19\". So the first token is t17.\n\nWait, does any non-terminal produce 't17'? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't17'. The closest is NT17, which as per the rules, I have:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50\n\nand \n\nNT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n\nBoth of which consist of NTs that expand further. For example, NT63 might expand to NT48 NT87, and then those could potentially expand into other NTs, etc., but I don't see a direct production for 't17' itself.\n\nWait, the string starts with t17, so perhaps no NT in the grammar directly produces t17. That would mean the string can't be generated, right?\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the terminals in the string: t17, t55, t1, t33, t27, t1, t4, t30, t37, t33, t32, t21, t19.\n\nAre any of these terminals directly produced by any of the NTs in the grammar? Because if none do, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLet me list the direct terminals in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs produce terminals:\n\nHere are the ones I can see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, wait, no: for each production, let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't44'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't44'\n\nNT32 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT58 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't17' (Wait, wait the production is NT11 \u2192 NT7 NT22, which can produce 't22' and 't36' eventually? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let's go through each NT that has a terminal as per the productions:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see directly:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't29'?

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. That should make it systematic to analyze.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. Each NT followed by a number is a non-terminal symbol. The string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols (like 't53', 't21', etc.), so my job is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol by expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start production: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must start with the expansion of NT88 and NT26. Let's see what each produces.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo, the string starts with t's, but let's see what NT8 and NT68 produce.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' (terminal)\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42 \u2192 then I need to see NT73 and NT42.\n\nLooking up NT73: It can be 't23' (terminal) or expand. Oh, wait, looking back at the productions, NH looks like \"NT73 -> 't27'\". Wait, no, in the original grammar, it's written as \"NT73 -> 't27'\", but earlier in the user message, the production was written as \"NT73 -> NT75 NT83\". That might be a typo. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar provided, under NT73: \"NT73 -> NT75 NT83\". So it's two non-terminals. Then, looking for NT75 and NT83.\n\nNT75 \u2192 NT55 NT79 \u2192 so each of these expands further. NT55 can be 't52' or other productions, but let's see what NT55's other option is.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar productions, for NT55: \"NT55 -> 't54'\". No, wait, looking at the provided grammar, under NT55 there are two productions: one is \"NT55 -> 't52'\" and another is \"NT55 -> 't54'\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Actually, in the grammar, under NT55:\n\n\"NT55 -> 't52'\" \nand \n\"NT55 -> 't54'\". So there are two options for NT55.\n\nWait, but that might be a mistake in the way the user presented the grammar, but assuming that's correct, the NT55 can produce 't52' or 't54'.\n\nGoing back, our string starts with 't53', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar for NT53: \"NT53 -> 't48'\". So 't53' corresponds to NT53 \u2192 't48'? Wait, no\u2014wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the grammar productions are given as, for example, \"NT53 -> 't48'\". So for non-terminal NT53, it can be replaced by the terminal 't48'. Similarly, NT73 expands as per the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I need to find where each NT in the string can come from.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to work backwards. The string is: `t53 t21 t4 t57 t54 t57 t29 t15 t6 t47 t29 t37 t37` \n\nThis is a sequence of t's, so all these must be produced by the non-terminals in the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-236","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t27 t53 t57 t38 t33 t30 t2 t45 t18 t11 t30 t56 t28 t45`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has each production rule with exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except the start symbol which can produce a terminal. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the rules are two non-terminals, which means the strings generated will consist of sequences of terminals produced from these non-terminals. The terminals in the string are things like 't27', 't53', etc. \n\nI also see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals (like NT48 \u2192 't27'). So, I can think of each terminal in the string as a production from a non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to map each token in the string to the corresponding grammar production. \n\n1. Start with the first token 't27'. Looking at the grammar, NT73 \u2192 't27' is one of the productions. So, 't27' comes from NT73.\n\n2. Next is 't53'. Looking for a non-terminal that produces 't53'. I see NT50 \u2192 't53'.\n\n3. Then 't57'. Hmm, checking the grammar, I don't see 't57' directly. Wait, did I miss it? Let me go through the rules again. Oh, I see NT94 \u2192 't57'. So 't57' is from NT94.\n\n4. Next is 't38'. Checking the grammar, NT53 \u2192 't38' (since NT53 \u2192 't38' is listed). So 't38' is from NT53.\n\n5. Then 't33'. NT33 is directly a terminal, right? Checking the rules, NT33 \u2192 't1'. Wait, but the string has 't33'; maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no: NT33 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, NT33 \u2192 't1' is present. So to produce 't33', perhaps another production? Wait, no, the rule is NT33 \u2192 't1', so that would produce 't1', not 't33'. Hmm, that might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe NT33 itself is part of a production. Wait, but in the given grammar, I don't see a production where NT33 has anything else on the right-hand side except 't1'. So maybe 't33' is from NT33 \u2192 't1' isn't directly helpful here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nWait, the string has 't33', so I need to find a production that gives 't33'. Looking through the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 't1' and also NT48 \u2192 't27'. Wait, no, 't33' isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, so does any non-terminal produce 't33'? Let me check again. Oh, I see NT48 \u2192 't27', and NT7 \u2192 't59', etc. Wait, perhaps I missed looking for 't33' elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT33 \u2192 't1' and also NT75 \u2192 't60', NT58 \u2192 't11', etc. Wait, perhaps 't33' is produced by another non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe it's produced by multiple steps. Let me think: perhaps NT4 \u2192 't20' and other rules. I might be getting stuck here. Maybe I should try another approach.\n\nLet me list each token and think about possible productions that could generate them, perhaps building a parse tree.\n\n1. 't27' comes from NT73 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSo, starting from S: \n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26 (from the given grammar rules)\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, to produce the given string, the string should be the combination of the two parts: the first part from NT88 and the second from NT26.\n\nLet me see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 (since NT88 -> NT8 NT32)\n\nThen NT8 \u2192 't29' (from NT8 \u2192 't29').\n\nSo the first part starts with 't29'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't27', which is from NT73, so perhaps this approach isn't matching. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the string is a combination of two sequences, each from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, the string should be split into two parts, each following the productions of NT88 and NT26 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string again: `t27 t53 t57 t38 t33 t30 t2 t45 t18 t11 t30 t56 t28 t45`.\n\nThat's 14 tokens. So NT88 and NT26 would each generate 7 tokens each? Or maybe not symmetric. Alternatively, the total length can vary, but for a string of 14 tokens, perhaps each part is 7 tokens.\n\nWait, let's see: each production can either produce a terminal or a non-terminal, so the number of tokens can vary based on the branching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to map the string backwards from the start symbol.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to parse the string and see if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to reduce it using the grammar rules.\n\nSo, the string is: t27 t53 t57 t38 t33 t30 t2 t45 t18 t11 t30 t56 t28 t45.\n\nI'll try to split this into two parts: let's say the first part is t27 t53 t57 t38 and the second is the rest. But maybe it's better to look for how the string can be divided.\n\nWait, considering that NT88 produces t27, perhaps that's the first part of the string.\n\nWait, no: NT88 produces a sequence that starts with NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Then NT8 \u2192 t29, and NT32 \u2192 t25, etc. So maybe that produces a string that starts with t29 and t25, but the string starts with t27, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. \n\nEach production in the grammar is two non-terminals except when a non-terminal produces a terminal. So each step in the derivation turns a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nSo, for the string to be in the language, the string must be a concatenation of the terminals produced by the two non-terminals NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, let's start by taking the string and trying to split it into two parts, left and right, where the left part is generated by NT88 and the right by NT26, or vice versa. However, the order might not be clear because the productions can vary in length.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the given string.\n\nLet's try to parse step by step.\n\nGiven the string: t27 t53 t57 t38 t33 t30 t2 t45 t18 t11 t30 t56 t28 t45.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to list all the productions for the non-terminals.\n\nSo, looking through all the rules, which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that directly produces a terminal:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t27\n- NT50 \u2192 t53\n- NT94 \u2192 t57\n- NT53 \u2192 t38\n- NT15 \u2192 t54 (Wait, no: the given rules don't have NT15. Wait, let me check again.)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, like:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 t27\n- NT50 \u2192 t53\n- NT94 \u2192 t57\n- NT53 \u2192 t38\n- NT33 \u2192 t1 (no, that's a terminal?), wait no, NT33 \u2192 t1. So 't1' comes from NT33.\n\nWait, but the string has 't33' as one of the terms. How do I get 't33' if only NT33 \u2192 t1 is present? That's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol can be replaced by two other symbols. The initial symbol is S, which is defined as `S -> NT88 NT26`. So, the start is always NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' tokens with numbers. Each 't' and number seems to be a terminal or part of a non-terminal. I think each NT followed by a number is a non-terminal, and the numbers are their labels. The 't' followed by a number is probably a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except when B or C is a terminal.

Similarly, NT48 can expand to 't2' or 't18', depending on the rule. So some NTs produce terminals, others produce non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT73 is 't27'. NT48 appears in two rules: NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and NT48 -> NT59 NT98, but also in another rule where it's a terminal? Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT48 is not directly a terminal. Only NT73 is. Let's see:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4. Looking at the rules, I see that some NTs are expanded into terminals. For example, NT48 can be 't2' NT18, but actually, looking at the rules, it seems NT73 is 't27'.\n\nWait, let me clarify. It seems that some NTs are terminals, others are not. For example, NT73 is defined as 't27', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT58 is defined as NT33 NT4. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the third line, it says NT26 -> NT68 NT13, which are both non-terminals. Then, looking further down, I see rules like NT58 -> NT33 NT4, which are non-terminals.

Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure since all the productions look like that.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t54 t32 t4 t39 t1 t33 t60 t37 t28 t19 t48 t6 t17 t36 t33`. \n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. The process involves working backwards from the string, trying to find the rightmost non-terminal that can produce the suffixes, and then proceeding leftwards until reaching the start symbol.\n\nLet me jot down the production rules again to keep track:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\n...and so on, with a ton of other production rules. Wait, that's a lot, but I notice that many of the non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals (the 't' followed by numbers), and a few have other non-terminals.\n\nI think a good approach is to see what each terminal corresponds to in terms of non-terminals. For example, 't54' must be produced by a specific rule. Looking at the list, I see NT54 has a production to produce 't16'. Wait, but that's t16, not t54. Hmm, maybe I should check all the 't' rules to see which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT58 produces 't25' (in 't28' as NT28). Wait, no, looking at NT28 \u2192 't56' and NT17 \u2192 't19', etc. Let me try to map each 't' terminal to its producing non-terminal.\n\nLet me list all the 't' rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2', NT70 \u2192 't11', NT75 \u2192 't60', NT55 \u2192 't52', NT28 \u2192 't56', NT17 \u2192 't19', NT8 \u2192 't29', NT11 \u2192 't30', NT66 \u2192 't30', NT55 \u2192 't54' (from another production?), NT8 \u2192 't54' (another?), NT72 \u2192 't32', NT12 \u2192 't17', NT8 \u2192 't6', NT97 \u2192 't4', NT94 \u2192 't57', NT51 \u2192 't39', NT2 \u2192 't36', NT91 \u2192 't44', NT18 \u2192 't26', NT12 \u2192 't23', NT72 \u2192 't23', NT94 \u2192 't23', NT54 \u2192 't16', NT13 \u2192 't12', NT59 \u2192 't15', NT72 \u2192 't38', NT58 \u2192 't28', NT98 \u2192 't45', NT88 \u2192 't37', NT86 \u2192 't9', NT83 \u2192 't52', NT33 \u2192 't1', NT28 \u2192 't25', NT48 \u2192 't27', NT11 \u2192 't21', NT69 \u2192 't27', NT50 \u2192 't38', NT35 \u2192 't44', NT58 \u2192 't11', NT11 \u2192 't17', NT7 \u2192 't2', NT70 \u2192 't11', NT53 \u2192 't48', NT72 \u2192 't33', NT76 \u2192 't55', NT22 \u2192 't44', NT41 \u2192 't49', NT2 \u2192 't34', NT40 \u2192 't60', NT20 \u2192 't20'.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. So each 't' corresponds to a specific non-terminal, except for those where a non-terminal can produce multiple 't's.\n\nWait, for example, NT7 \u2192 't2' and also NT70 \u2192 't11'. So, if in the string there's a 't2', that must come from NT7.\n\nSimilarly, 't54' appears in both NT54 \u2192 't14' and NT28 \u2192 't56' (but that's 56, not 54). Wait, no. Looking again, perhaps I got that wrong.\n\nLet me see: NT17 \u2192 't19', NT58 \u2192 't25', NT28 \u2192 't56', NT78... wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should make a list of the 't's and their origins.\n\nActually, maybe it's better to approach it by trying to match the string from the end, using the production rules.\n\nWait, the string is: t54, t32, t4, t39, t1, t33, t60, t37, t28, t19, t48, t6, t17, t36, t33.\n\nSo the last token is t33. Looking at the production rules, which non-terminals produce 't33'?\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't56' (no)\n- NT72 \u2192 't33' when? Wait, yes! NT72 can produce 't44' sometimes, but I'm looking for t33.\n\nWait, let me check all 't' rules. Wait, maybe I missed one. Looking at NT33 \u2192 't1' and NT72 \u2192 't33' (wait, I'm seeing that somewhere).\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT72 appears in NT72 \u2192 NT55 and NT76.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the rules that have 't' as their right-hand side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the easiest approach is to see which non-terminals produce each 't' token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to find the entire tree.\n\nWait, the string is a sequence of terminals, so it was derived from the start symbol S via a series of productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So when deriving, each step reduces the number of symbols by replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, until you reach terminals.\n\nBut here, the string is 15 tokens, and S is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, so the derivation tree would have to start with S, then each non-terminal can be expanded into two non-terminals, until leaves are all terminals.\n\nWait, but that's for a rightmost derivation. Alternatively, leftmost, but the string is given in order, so perhaps it's the rightmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the string by trying to match from the end, using the reverse of the productions.\n\nThe reverse approach: each production A \u2192 a can be reversed as a \u2192 A, and each A \u2192 BC can be reversed as B \u2192 A, C \u2192 A.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, in the given string, the last symbol is t33, so perhaps it occurs in a production where the non-terminal can produce t33.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I'm seeing that NT72 can produce 't44' and 't55' among others? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, going back to the rules:\n\nLooking for terminals, for example:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 t44, t55?\nWait, I saw a rule: NT72 \u2192 t44 (from NT91 \u2192 t44) or is that different?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps I can try to see if each step in the string can be matched by some production starting from the end.\n\nLet's think in reverse: the string is t54, t32, t4, t39, t1, t33, t60, t37, t28, t19, t48, t6, t17, t36, t33.\n\nSo the last symbol is t33. Looking for rules where a non-terminal A is directly connected to t33. So, which production rules have t33 as their RHS.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking through, I see NT72 \u2192 't44' and 't55' but that's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-254","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which helps because it has a specific structure: every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the given grammar. It looks like the grammar has non-terminals like S, NT63, NT26, etc., and some of these non-terminals are directly mapped to terminals with 't' followed by a number. For example, NT72 is 't36' and NT8 is 't29'. So, each non-terminal can expand into either another non-terminal pair or a terminal string.\n\nThe provided string to check is: `t1 t1 t26 t57 t1 t9 t29 t27 t30 t36 t6 t29 t33 t57 t32`. \n\nI think the best approach is to perform a leftmost derivation. In CNF, each step expands the leftmost non-terminal. Since the final string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can derive exactly this sequence.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. From the grammar, S -> NT88 NT26. So, S can only expand into NT88 and NT26. That means the first two symbols of the string must come from NT88 and NT26, which are the first two non-terminals expanding from S.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two symbols are t1 and t1. Wait, NT88 -> t8, so expanding NT88 would give 't8', which is not 't1'. Hmm, that's a problem. So, NT88 can't expand into 't1'. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, no, wait, checking each NT rule:\n\nLet me list out some of the terminals:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32 (since S is NT88 NT26)\nBut wait, looking at the full grammar, NT88 is a combination, but let me check if there's any NT that directly gives t1.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that goes directly to t1. Wait, let me check again. The rules start with Nts and terminals. For example, NT28 -> t56, but that's not t1. \n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Let me check the production rules:\n\nLooking for NT-> t1. I don't see any NT directly mapping to t1 in the given grammar. Wait, but looking again:\n\nWait, in the list, there's no NT directly mapping to t1. For example, NT58 -> NT33 NT4, but that's a non-terminal. Similarly, NT11 -> 't4'. Oh, but 't4' is a string. Wait, but I need to find a path to t1. Is there any way a non-terminal could derive 't1'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT11 -> 't4', but that's not t1. NT19 is 't29', but I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me search the grammar for NT mappings to terminals, especially t1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in the rules I missed. Let me check each line:\n\nFrom the list:\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT19 -> 't29' (Wait, no, looking again, it's NT17 -> 't29', not NT19. Hmm.)\nWait, checking each production:\n\nNT33 is sometimes 't1', I see: \"NT33 -> 't1'\". So, NT33 can produce 't1'. There's a rule: \"NT33 -> 't1'\". So, if a non-terminal can expand to NT33, which then can produce t1, that might help.\n\nSo, back to the string. The first two symbols are t1 and t1. So, the first step would be S -> NT88 NT26. We need NT88 to expand to t1 or to something that can derive t1, but I don't see how NT88 directly does that.\n\nWait, wait a minute. The initial expansion of S produces NT88 and NT26. Let me check what NT88 can do. Looking at the production rules, NT88 is: \"NT88 -> NT8 NT32\". So, NT88 can't produce a terminal directly; it has to produce another Nt symbol.\n\nWait, so the first symbol in the string is t1. But if NT88 expands into NT8 and NT32, then the leftmost expansion would start with NT8, but NT8 can expand into... Let me look: NT8 is 't29' based on a rule. Wait, no: \"NT8 -> 't29'\". So NT8 can produce t29. But the start symbol's expansion is NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, how does t1 come into play? If S expands to NT88 NT26, the leftmost is NT88, which can only expand into NT8 and NT32. Then, NT8 expands to t29, which is not t1.\n\nWait, so the first symbol would be t29, but the string starts with t1. Therefore, there's a contradiction. That would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first two symbols can't match.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because the first t1 doesn't match any possible expansion starting from S.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check if there's any rule that allows NT33 to expand into something that leads to t1, but the grammar starts with S -> NT88 NT26, which can't produce t33 directly. Therefore, the expansion starts with NT88, which goes to NT8 and NT32. \n\nBut perhaps the leftmost derivation could go through some other path? Let me think again. Wait, NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So, the first expansion would have NT88 becoming NT8 and NT32. Then, the leftmost is NT8, which is a terminal, t29. So, the first symbol would have to be t29, not t1.\n\nHence, the string's first symbol is t1, which can't be derived from the grammar's S production.

{"custom_id":"request-275","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t36 t33 t19 t34 t52 t11 t12 t6 t20 t9 t8 t36 t48 t26 t23 t17`. \n\nFirst, I should understand what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means. CNF is a way of structuring context-free grammars where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This structure makes parsing more straightforward and is useful for certain algorithms.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice it's mostly non-terminals (like NT13, NT26, etc.) expanding into other non-terminals and terminals. Some of them directly expand into terminals. For example, NT72 \u2192 't32' and NT94 \u2192 't57'. So, this grammar has both non-terminal and terminal productions.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, all of which seem to be 't' followed by a number. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the provided productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, S produces two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Each of these non-terminals must expand eventually into terminals through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Both NT8 and NT32 are non-terminals. Then each of these needs to expand further.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nLet's look at the string. The first symbol is t36. So, t36 should come from some production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT72 \u2192 't32', but that's 't32', not 't36'. Wait, is there any NT that expands directly into 't36'? Looking through the list of terminals, I don't see any NT directly producing 't36'. Hmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of non-terminals that eventually produce 't36'. Let me check if any non-terminal expands into something that can derive t36.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT7 \u2192 't2', which is a terminal. That's a direct production, but that's 't2', not 't36'. Maybe other paths.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a path from the root S down to the given string. Let me see:\n\nThe string starts with t36. So, we need a production that starts with NT88 or NT26 that can produce t36.\n\nLooking at NT88's production: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So, this is two non-terminals. Each of these needs to expand into a terminal, like 't' something. \n\nSo, the first step is to see if the first 't36' can come from NT8 or NT32. But wait, NT88 is the first part of S, so the first expansion is NT88 and NT26, producing two parts of the string separated by something. Wait, no\u2014the entire expansion of S will produce a string that's the concatenation of the expansions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, if I have S \u2192 NT88 NT26, then the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT88 and the expansion of NT26.\n\nLooking at the given string: t36 t33 t19 t34 t52 t11 t12 t6 t20 t9 t8 t36 t48 t26 t23 t17.\n\nWait, that's 15 symbols. But let me check the number of symbols: t36 (1), t33 (2), t19 (3), t34 (4), t52 (5), t11 (6), t12 (7), t6 (8), t20 (9), t9 (10), t8 (11), t36 (12), t48 (13), t26 (14), t23 (15), t17 (16). Oh, 16 symbols. So, perhaps the expansion of NT88 is 8 symbols and NT26 is 8 symbols? Or some other split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built from multiple levels of expansion. Let me try to see the possible paths.\n\nStarting with NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. I need to see if 't36' can be derived from NT8 or NT32.\n\nLooking at NT8's productions: NT8 \u2192 NT47 NT29. Both non-terminals. So, need to see what these can produce.\n\nWait, this could get complex. Maybe I can work backwards through the string to see if it fits any of the grammar's possible paths.\n\nLet me list the symbols in the string again for clarity:\n\nt36, t33, t19, t34, t52, t11, t12, t6, t20, t9, t8, t36, t48, t26, t23, t17.\n\n16 symbols.\n\nFirst, let's see where t36 comes from. Looking at the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce t36? Looking through each terminal production:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't27', 't52', etc., but not 't36'. Similarly, NT17 \u2192 't29', and NT20 \u2192 't20'. There's no production that directly gives t36. Hmm, that suggests that t36 must come from a longer path through the grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps each 't' in the string comes from a terminal produced by a non-terminal. So, for example, t36 could come from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't36' via a chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion of S is leading to a leftmost derivation that produces this string. Let's try to see.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for the entire string as a concatenation of the expanded NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me consider NT88 first:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\nSo, NT88 expands to some terminals, and NT26 expands to others. The entire string should be the concatenation of these two.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if the first few symbols can be matched by NT88 and the latter by NT26.\n\nLet me see. The first symbol is t36. So, maybe the production path for NT88 includes t36.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So, both NT8 and NT32 must produce parts of the string.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT47 NT29.\n\nNT47 \u2192 NT25 NT56.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. This might take a while, but let me try to map out a possible expansion.\n\nLet me see the string: t36, t33, t19, t34, t52, t11, t12, t6, t20, t9, t8, t36, t48, t26, t23, t17.\n\nWait, I see that t36 appears twice: at position 1 and 12. Maybe this indicates some recursion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains all the necessary steps through the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet me list the string again:\n\nt36, t33, t19, t34, t52, t11, t12, t6, t20, t9, t8, t36, t48, t26, t23, t17.\n\nI need to see if this can be built by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some substitutions can lead to this string.\n\nFor example, starting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and each non-terminal being expanded into terminals and other non-terminals in such a way that the concatenation produces the string.\n\nBut considering that the string has 16 symbols, and S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which are two parts, each of which may produce 8 symbols, that may be the case.\n\nBut without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can only be formed if certain sequences of productions lead to this. Let me see if any part of the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let's see if any rule can produce a 't17'. For example, NT17 \u2192 t29 or t53 or t19.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, NT8's production is NT47 NT29.\n\nWait, and NT47 \u2192 NT25 NT56, and NT56 \u2192 t16, and NT25 \u2192 t56 (wait no"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure where each production rule has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, actually in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, but sometimes people define CNF to require each production to have exactly two non-terminals, but now I'm getting confused. Wait, looking back, the rules are in Chomsky Normal Form if each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some productions have two non-terminals, others have a non-terminal and a terminal, and some have two terminals. Wait, let me check a few examples. For instance, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals. NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, same. But then NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. Both are non-terminals?

For example, NT55 \u2192 't8', so that's a terminal. Similarly, NT72 \u2192 't32'. So, these are terminals.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by recursively checking possible steps.

{"custom_id":"request-294","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Also, I notice that some of the non-terminals are now terminals, probably because we're done expanding them. My string to check is `t52 t21 t32 t20 t47 t49 t47 t57 t23 t55 t53 t30 t27 t29 t57 t2 t33`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Starting from the start symbol S, which is broken down into NT88 and NT26. Looking at the grammar, each of these non-terminals seems to lead to other non-terminals until they eventually resolve into the terminal symbols.\n\nSo, let's break down the string step by step. If I can find a way to parse it using the grammar, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no. Parsing context-free grammars often uses a top-down or bottom-up approach, but since I'm just checking if the string can be derived, maybe a parsing approach would help.\n\nStarting with the string: [t52 t21 t32 t20 t47 t49 t47 t57 t23 t55 t53 t30 t27 t29 t57 t2 t33]. The first symbol is t52, which I need to see if it's produced by any rule. Looking at the rules, I see NT55 can produce t52, as per the given list. So that's the first symbol.\n\nNow the next symbol is t21. Looking at the grammar, the production for NT21 isn't directly there, but I see NT69 -> t27, which is more likely. Wait, maybe I need to re-express the rules more clearly. Alternatively, perhaps I should map all the non-terminals that are now terminal symbols.\n\nWait, the given list has entries where the non-terminal on the left becomes a specific terminal on the right. For example, NT55 -> t52, NT40 -> t6, and so on. So the process will involve working backwards from each t in the string to see if it can come from a corresponding production rule.\n\nSo let's list all the terminal symbols in the string and see if they're present in the production rules. The string has t52, t21, t32, t20, t47, t49, t47, t57, t23, t55, t53, t30, t27, t29, t57, t2, t33.\n\nLooking at the production rules, some terminals are generated by NT, like NT55 -> t52. But there's no rule that produces t21 directly. Alternatively, perhaps t21 is an output of a non-terminal that eventually leads to it.\n\nWait, let me look at the rules again. For example, NT55 is not present in the production rules anymore; it's replaced by an output of t52. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps NT21 is a non-terminal, but I don't see it in the rules. Maybe I need to re-examine the given grammar list.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see that NT18 can produce t47 and t45, NT57 can produce t56, and so on. I need to map each t in the string to a production rule.\n\nLet me try to map each t in the string:\n\n- t52: Looking at the rules, NT55 -> t52.\n- t21: I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces t21, so perhaps I need to see if there's a production where the left side leads to it. Wait, maybe t21 is a terminal, but the grammar doesn't have such a rule, so maybe the string can't be generated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check the list again. I see entries like NT28 -> t56, NT17 -> t29, NT55 -> t52, etc. So NT52 is in the left-hand side as NT55 -> t52? Or maybe NT55 is the non-terminal that produces t52.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to construct a parse tree starting from S. S is NT88 NT26. So the string can be split into two parts: the left part (NT88) and the right part (NT26). Each of these needs to be generated.\n\nFirst, let's look at the start symbol S: it's NT88 and NT26. Now, the string starts with t52, so maybe t52 is generated by NT88. Let's see the production for NT88: Looking at the rules, I see S: S->NT88 NT26, and under NT88, looking through the list, I don't see a production directly for NT88. Wait, maybe I need to express each NT as a production.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NTs and their rules. For example:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32, as per the rule S->NT88 NT26, and under NT8, I see NT8 -> t29.\nWait, no, that's under the list.

{"custom_id":"request-291","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t30 t11 t54 t55 t56 t36 t49 t57 t28 t21 t53 t37 t28 t9 t28 t9 t21`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, all the productions on the right-hand side are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, but for this problem, I might just need to see if the string can be produced by following these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it's a list of productions with non-terminals on the left and combinations of non-terminals or terminals on the right. I notice that most of the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals like 't' followed by a number, which are probably terminal symbols. The goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string starts with `t30`, which is interesting because looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see any production that directly starts with `t30`. Instead, non-terminals like `NT7`, `NT90`, etc., seem to produce `t2`, `t30`, `t4`, etc., but there's no direct `NT30` so I can't have a production rule for `t30` directly unless it's part of a composite production like `NTsomething` \u2192 `t30 something`.\n\nBut wait, the given grammar doesn't have any NT rule that produces `t30`. Looking through all the productions, I see some start with `NT... -> t...`, but none that produce `t30`. For example, `NT11 -> t4`, `NT17 -> t29`, `NT66 -> t30`, etc. So where does `t30` come from in the string?\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is `t30`. To get `t30`, there must be a production that produces it. From the grammar, `NT66 -> t30`. But in the grammar, `NT66` is defined as `NT33 NT30`? Wait, no, let me check. The grammar has `NT17 -> t29`, `NT91 -> t44`, etc. Wait, no, I don't see `NT66` in the productions. Wait, actually, looking through the grammar, I see `NT66 -> t30`, which is one of the productions. So `NT66` \u2192 `t30`. \n\nSo the string starts with `t30`, which must come from `NT66`. So somewhere in the string's derivation, there must be a NT66 that splits into t30. \n\nBut to get to NT66, we need to see where NT66 comes from. Wait, looking through the productions, is there a production for NT66 on the left side? Let me scan the grammar: \n\nI see productions like `S -> NT88 NT26`, `NT26 -> NT68 NT13`, `NT68 -> NT54 NT28`, etc. Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see any NT66 -> something. Instead, NT66 is on the right side of a production, like `NT66 -> t30`. So, NT66 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by `t30`. \n\nSo to have `t30` in the string, there must be a NT66 that appears before it in the derivation. So the string would start with NT66 \u2192 t30, then the rest of the string must come from the other part of the production that includes NT66. But wait, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right, so if NT66 is on the left, its production is `NT66 -> a b` where a and b are either non-terminals or terminals. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for NT66 on the left; all I see is on the right. So NT66 isn't a non-terminal but a terminal? But that can't be because NT66 is part of the productions as a terminal, but in CNF, the non-terminals on the left must produce exactly two symbols on the right. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. In CNF, non-terminals can only produce exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and something else. But in this case, NT66 is on the right side of a production, not the left. So perhaps the grammar isn't in proper CNF? Wait, perhaps the grammar provided isn't in CNF because some non-terminals on the left have more than two symbols on the right or terminals. Wait, but all the productions in the grammar are of the form NTxy -> a b or a single terminals, so perhaps I'm correct in thinking that it's in CNF.\n\nWait, no, wait. CNF requires that all productions be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in the given grammar, I need to check if all the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26: Yes, both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals.\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87: Yes.\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13: Both are non-terminals.\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18: Both NT77, NT18 are non-terminals.\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58: Both are non-terminals.\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79: Both non-terminals.\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22: Both non-terminals.\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22: Both non-terminals.\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83: Both non-terminals.\n- NT51 -> NT70 NT94: Both.\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69: Both.\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70: Both.\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4: NT33 is non-terminal, 4 is terminal. Hmm, wait, that's a problem. NT58 \u2192 NT33 (non-terminal) and '4' (terminal). So in a CNF grammar, each production should have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So this is okay because '4' is a terminal. But wait, in some definitions, CNF requires that all right-hand sides are exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So this seems acceptable because '4' is a terminal and NT33 is a non-terminal. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nWait, but some productions have something like NT88 \u2192 NT88 something else, but wait, no, in the given grammar, all left-hand sides are non-terminals, right? So the first part seems okay.\n\nSo, the string starts with `t30`, which must be produced by NT66, according to the grammar's production. So now, to get `t30`, we have to have a step where NT66 is derived as `t30`. Then, where does NT66 come from? Looking through all productions, do any right-hand sides produce NT66? I don't see any production for NT66 on the left side. All I see is on the right side of a production. So this is a problem because NT66 doesn't appear as a left-hand side, meaning it's a terminal, but the grammar is supposed to be CNF with non-terminals on the left. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar. Maybe there's a production for NT66 as a left-hand side that's not listed. Looking through the list, I don't see any NT66 on the left. So perhaps the grammar is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, maybe the grammar isn't correctly formed. Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, I don't see any NT66 on the left. So if NT66 is not a non-terminal, then it's a terminal. But NT63 is a non-terminal, and in `NT58 -> NT33 NT4`, so that's fine. But for NT66, the right side is just `t30`, which is a terminal, but in the left side, there is no production, so NT66 isn't a non-terminal, which violates CNF. So perhaps the grammar is miswritten, but since the problem states that the grammar is given in CNF, I must assume that it's correct, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of rules, some of which end with a terminal, meaning they are terminal productions. For example, `NT7 -> t2`, or `NT97 -> t4`. So, the leaves of the parse tree would be these terminals, and the non-terminals would combine them according to the production rules.\n\nMy task is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. But looking at the grammar, I see that S is defined as `S -> NT88 NT26`. So the entire string should consist of the two parts derived from NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, but the string given is a series of terminals separated by spaces. That means it's a single string, right? So I need to think of it as a flat sequence, not a tree. I think the grammar is such that each production ultimately expands to all terminals, so perhaps the string's length should match the number of symbols produced by S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which would be two symbols for NT88 and NT26, but the string has 18 tokens. Hmm, that seems off because each NT production can expand into more symbols, so maybe the length isn't directly the issue.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look at the grammar rules again. Each non-terminal in the grammar seems to expand into two non-terminals (the left side of the grammar is in CNF, so each is of the form NT... \u2192 NT... NT...). So, each NT production contributes two more symbols until we hit the terminals.\n\nGiven that, I need to see if the given string can be broken down into the required productions. Let's start by looking at the string and seeing if we can match it step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t44 t26 t1 t23 t53 t25 t60 t45 t25 t29 t33 t2 t15 t57 t26 t18 t48 t21`. That's 18 tokens. Since each NT production breaks down into two, maybe the parse starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Each of these NTs will expand into more symbols until we get to the terminals.\n\nLet me take the first part: the string starts with t44. Looking at the grammar, which NT productions result in t44 or t something. Scanning through, I see:\n\n- NT45 \u2192 something, but perhaps more importantly, `NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and NT50 -> 't53'`. Oh, wait, `NT50` is a terminal, it directly produces 't53'. So maybe that's useful.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to parse the string backwards to see if it matches the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps a top-down approach, starting from S and expanding.\n\nLet's start with the entire string. It's 18 tokens. S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string should be divided into two parts derived from NT88 and NT26. Let me check if the string can be split into two parts, each possibly derived from NT88 and NT26.\n\nThe first token is t44. Let's see what NT88 expands to. Looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- Then, NT8 \u2192 't29'\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n  - NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n    - NT75 \u2192 't60'\n    - NT83 \u2192 't52'\n  - NT42 \u2192 't30'\n- So, NT32 \u2192 't60' 't52' ?\nWait, no, NT42 is a terminal? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT42: in the grammar, I see `NT42 -> 't30'`. So yes, NT42 can be 't30'. Similarly, NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83. NT75 is a terminal 't60', and NT83 is 't52'. So NT73 \u2192 't60' 't52', meaning 't60 t52'?\n\nWait, but NT88 is NT8 \u2192 't29' and NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So NT32 \u2192 't60' 't52' (from NT73 and NT42). So putting it all together, NT88 \u2192 't29' 't60' 't52'.\n\nBut the string starts with t44, not t29. Hmm, maybe that's not the right path. Maybe I'm looking for the wrong NT in the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with different NTs. Let me see if any of the NTs expand into t44. Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't44' being the result of an NT production's expansion.\n\nWait, I don't see 't44' as the terminal of any NT. So maybe the string is built from NTs that don't directly produce the early t44. So perhaps the first part is NT26, which I see in the S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nWait, perhaps I should assign variables: the entire string is built by NT88 producing the first part and NT26 producing the second part. Let's split the string into two parts. Let me count:\n\nThe string is 18 tokens. If S \u2192 NT88 NT26, then each NT will produce a sequence of tokens. Let me try to split the string at some point into two parts, each part being the expansion of NT88 and NT26.\n\nBut this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree starting from S.\n\nLet's start by taking S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must be split into the tokens derived by NT88 and NT26. Let's see:\n\nThe entire string is `t44 t26 t1 t23 t53 t25 t60 t45 t25 t29 t33 t2 t15 t57 t26 t18 t48 t21`. Let's check if the first token t44 is part of the NT88 expansion or the NT26 expansion.\n\nLooking at NT88: according to the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nThen, NT8 \u2192 't29', NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83, which are 't60' and 't52'. So NT73 \u2192 't60 t52'.\n\nNT42 \u2192 't30'. So overall, NT88 \u2192 't29' 't60' 't52'.\n\nBut the first token is t44, not t29, so this suggests that maybe the string isn't starting with the expansion of NT88, but perhaps we have a different split.\n\nWait, maybe I was looking at S \u2192 NT88 NT26, but perhaps the string starts with the other NT. Alternatively, perhaps S is derived in a way that the first part is more than one symbol. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assign each token to the production hierarchy. Since the string starts with t44, perhaps it's an NT that eventually leads to that. But looking at the grammar, none of the NTs directly produce t44. So perhaps the first token is part of a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me try a different approach. Let me try to break down the string step by step, starting from the start symbol.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29'.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83.\n\nNT75 \u2192 't60'.\n\nNT83 \u2192 't52'.\n\nSo, putting it together: NT88 \u2192 't29' 't60' 't52'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT16 NT13.\n\nLet me see NT54: according to the grammar, NT54 \u2192 NT16 NT13.\n\nAnd NT16 \u2192 NT21.\n\nWait, no, looking"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly one non-terminal or terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, let me look at the grammar provided. It seems like it's a set of productions where each non-terminal on the left produces two non-terminals on the right. The strings are built by replacing these non-terminals until terminals are all that's left.\n\nLooking at the string, I see a bunch of `t` followed by numbers. Some of these `tX` sequences are single-character terminals, like `t4`, `t6`, etc. Others are multi-character, like `t57`, which would correspond to two terminals. Wait, no, actually looking more closely, every terminal in the grammar starts with `t`, so each terminal is like `tX`. So each production uses the rules where, say, NT88 produces NT8 and NT32, which in turn produce other terminals.\n\nI think the standard approach here is to use the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing strings using a context-free grammar in CNF. But since I'm not very familiar with CYK, maybe I can find another way.\n\nAlternatively, since each production expands a single non-terminal into two, the length of the string in terms of symbols should be a power of 2 after the initial application. Wait, the initial string in the grammar has two symbols, so each expansion would double the number of symbols on the string. But our input string has 17 symbols, which is not a power of two (since 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32). Wait, but maybe the initial string is built from two non-terminals, so each step doubles the string. Hmm, but 17 is an odd number, so that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let's count the number of symbols in the string. The string is `t4 t6 t23 t26 t32 t12 t4 t33 t57 t1 t9 t37 t21 t55 t36 t19 t1 t1`. Let me count them:\n\n1. t4\n2. t6\n3. t23\n4. t26\n5. t32\n6. t12\n7. t4\n8. t33\n9. t57\n10. t1\n11. t9\n12. t37\n13. t21\n14. t55\n15. t36\n16. t19\n17. t1\n18. t1\n\nWait, actually, I just noticed that in the original string, it's written as `t4 t6 t23 t26 t32 t12 t4 t33 t57 t1 t9 t37 t21 t55 t36 t19 t1 t1`, which is 18 symbols in total. Hmm, okay, so 18 symbols.\n\nBut in the grammar, each non-terminal production results in two non-terminals, so starting from one non-terminal, after one step, you have two, then four, then eight, etc. So the number of symbols is a power of 2. But 18 is not a power of 2, so that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, maybe my assumption is wrong because the grammar might have multiple starting points or something.\n\nWait, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT88 and NT26. So the initial expansion is two non-terminals, leading to a string of two non-terminals. Each step replaces each non-terminal with two, so lengths are 2, 4, 8, etc. So the total number of symbols should be 2^n, a power of 2. Since 18 isn't a power of 2, that suggests it's not possible. But 18 is even, so maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount the string as given in the question:\n\nThe string is: `t4 t6 t23 t26 t32 t12 t4 t33 t57 t1 t9 t37 t21 t55 t36 t19 t1 t1`.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nt4, t6, t23, t26, t32, t12, t4, t33, t57, t1, t9, t37, t21, t55, t36, t19, t1, t1. So that's 18 t-symbols, each being 't' followed by a number. But in terms of symbols, each 'tX' is a single terminal, but each is a symbol. So the entire string is 18 symbols long, including all the 't's and numbers. But wait, no, the string is a sequence of these 'tX' terms, each connected with spaces, so each is a separate symbol. So the length is 18 symbols.\n\nBut in the grammar, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols in the derived string should be a power of 2. 18 is not a power of 2, so that suggests it's impossible. Thus, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake because the initial S produces two non-terminals, which expand to four, eight, etc. So after n steps, the number of symbols would be 2^n. But in the input, the number of symbols is 18, which is not a power of 2. Thus, it's impossible for this string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, after considering this, I conclude that the string is not generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is `t8 t1 t38 t9 t39 t30 t19 t32 t28 t33 t36 t44 t6 t23 t55 t15 t19 t49`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the grammar. Looking at the production rules, each non-terminal on the left side of the arrows expands into exactly two non-terminals on the right side. That makes sense because CNF requires productions to be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. I notice that some rules directly produce terminals, like `NT73 -> 't27'`, which immediately gives a token t27, but others only produce other non-terminals.\n\nSince the string consists entirely of terminal tokens, I need to see if I can derive this string starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which according to the first rule, produces NT88 and NT26. So, the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNow, I'll look at each of these non-terminals, NT88 and NT26, and see what they produce. From the given rules:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo, starting off, S becomes NT88 NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13.\n\nNow, I'll proceed to expand each of these non-terminals step by step.\n\nFirst, let's expand NT8 (from NT88).

The string is `t56 t23 t48 t1 t25 t20 t57 t29 t23 t36 t17 t47 t6 t28 t25 t45 t53 t1 t37`. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for the start symbol, which can have the initial terminals. All productions have either one non-terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production should be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So in this case, looking at the grammar, all the rules except for some seem to have two non-terminals on the right. But wait, the start symbol S is `S -> NT88 NT26`, which is two non-terminals. Then, looking at other rules like `NT2 -> NT87 NT70`, each rule is producing two non-terminals. So maybe this is CNF.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nI'll approach this by trying to reverse-engineer the string. Each step, I'll look for the rightmost symbol and see if there's a production that can produce it, starting from the end. So, starting with the last symbol, which is `t37`. I'll see if any production ends with `t37`. \n\nLooking through the right-hand sides of the rules, I notice that `NT88` has a rule `NT88 -> NT8 NT32`, and `NT32 -> NT73 NT42`. But wait, I'm looking for a production that results in `t37`. Hmm, looking through the rules, `NT48 -> NT2 NT18` and `NT18 -> 't29'` but that's terminal. Wait, perhaps I should look for a terminal symbol and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, certain non-terminals produce terminals. For example, `NT7 -> 't2'`, `NT98 -> 't41'`, `NT90 -> 't91'`, etc. So I need to find a path where the string's tokens are produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree for the string and see if it's possible.\n\nFirst, the string has 19 tokens. Let's note them in order: 1. t56, 2. t23, 3. t48, 4. t1, 5. t25, 6. t20, 7. t57, 8. t29, 9. t23, 10. t36, 11. t17, 12. t47, 13. t6, 14. t28, 15. t25, 16. t45, 17. t53, 18. t1, 19. t37.\n\nSince S starts with NT88 and NT26, perhaps the string can be broken down into parts starting with these. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT88 and the second by NT26.\n\nSo, let's take the first part: t56, t23, t48, t1, t25, t20, t57, t29, t23, t36, t17, t47, t6, t28, t25, t45, t53, t1, t37.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is a flat list, but each token is separate. So the entire string is S's derivation, each node being a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with NT88 and NT26. Let's see: the first part is t56, t23, t48, t1, t25, t20, t57, t29, t23, t36, t17, t47, t6, t28, t25, t45, t53, t1, t37.\n\nBut wait, the initial rule is S->NT88 NT26. So the leftmost symbols are NT88 and NT26. So the entire string should be a sequence of terminals generated by NT88 and NT26. But wait, how does the string split? Let me recheck: the string is S's expansion, so the string is divided into two main branches: the production of NT88 and NT26. So, for example, NT88 would generate a sequence of terminals, and NT26 would generate another sequence, and together they form the full string. Or is it? Wait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so S's derivation is NT88 followed by NT26. So the entire string is a sequence where the first part is generated by NT88 and the second part by NT26.\n\nSo the full string is the combination of the two generated sequences. Therefore, the entire string can be split into two halves, each generated by NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo first, let's look at NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 (rule 48 in the first section)\nAnd NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42 (rule 35 in the right-hand side)\nNT73 \u2192 't27' (from rule 42 in the right-hand side: NT73 -> 't27')\nWait, no, looking at the grammar: looking for NT73 rules.

Hmm, let's start by looking at the grammar and seeing how it generates strings, specifically those that result in sequences of these t's.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC, except possibly the start symbol. Each production has two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions are between non-terminals, right? Or are terminals allowed? Oh right, sometimes CNF allows productions to terminals as well, but here I see that the grammar uses non-terminals on the left and right of productions, except some have a terminal on the right. For example, S->NT88 NT26. But some productions like NT77->NT33 NT79 and others lead to terminals, like NT58->NT33 NT4, which might mean that the grammar actually isn't pure CNF, but somewhere in between. Maybe it's in a mixed form because some productions have two terminals? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking back, some productions have two non-terminals, like NT77->NT33 NT79, but others have a non-terminal and a terminal. For example, NT58->NT33 NT4, so that's a non-terminal leading to another non-terminal and a terminal. So maybe the grammar is in Modified Chomsky Normal Form, where productions can have terminals or non-terminals on the right, but no two terminals in a single production except maybe the start symbol. So that should be okay.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of t followed by some numbers. I need to see if each tX can be derived from some non-terminal. Let's map each t to the corresponding non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT19 -> 't29', so t29 corresponds to NT19.\n- NT42->t18, so t18 is NT42.\n- NT15->t15 (given as NT15->t15?), wait, looking for NT15.\n\nWait, checking the productions, I see NT15->t15?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a list of productions, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and right-hand side. Some of them are terminals ending with 't', others are non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms and other non-terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t52 t17 t60 t49 t60 t27 t11 t18 t47 t19 t12 t56 t34 t47 t55 t16 t53 t54 t38 t34`.\n\nI remember that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. Also, a string generated by such a grammar consists of the right-hand sides of the productions applied in sequence, replacing non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if the given production sequence can derive this string step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first symbol in the string, which is 't52'. I need to find a production that leads to 't52'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT58 \u2192 t52. So, perhaps 't52' comes from NT58.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar has several entries ending with 't':\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 \u2192 looking at NT58's production, it's actually NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18, and then looking at NT69's production: NT69 \u2192 NT27. So, perhaps that's not directly the case.\n\nWait, let's list all the productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4: Both are non-terminals, so this can't produce 't52'.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68: Both non-terminals.\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40: Both non-terminals.\n- NT75 \u2192 t60.

Wait, earlier I thought NT48 had t27, but looking again: Is there a duplicate?\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT48 is mentioned twice: once as \u2192 NT2 NT18 and another as \u2192 t27. So, NT48 can produce t27.\n\nWait, yes, the second line says NT48 \u2192 t27. So, if NT48 can lead to 't27', but also the first production is NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18.\n\nBut in the string, I have 't52 t17...', so 't52' is the first symbol. I need to find if 't52' can be produced by any production. Looking through the productions, I see that NT56 \u2192 t47 but that's not our case. Wait, let me check each production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLet's go through each production:\n\n1. NT58 \u2192 t52 \u2192 So, NT58 \u2192 t52. So, that means if NT58 can be the start symbol, then 't52' is directly derived.\n2. NT90 \u2192 t91 t68, etc., but no terminal.\n3. NT35 \u2192 t44, which is a terminal, so NT35 produces t44.\n4. NT22 \u2192 t44.\n5. NT48 \u2192 t27.\n6. NT11 \u2192 t7, wait no: NT11 \u2192 t4.\nWait, let me list them:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t52\n- NT17 \u2192 t29 (multiple times)\n- NT48 \u2192 t27 (multiple times)\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT5 \u2192 ...

{"custom_id":"request-376","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through the steps methodically.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grammar. It's given in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that B or C can be terminals. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the entire string must start with whatever NT88 produces and then whatever NT26 produces.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules, I see that most of them are non-terminals expressing each other. For example:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n- And so on.\n\nBut wait, there are some terminals listed in the production rules. For example, NT7 \u2192 't2', and NT70 \u2192 't12'. These terminals are part of the grammar's vocabulary, so whenever a production rule ends with a terminal, that's the end of that branch.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: t30 t34 t55 t34 t8 t32 t19 t53 t52 t52 t1 t2 t30 t56 t21 t12 t45 t44 t52 t9 t33.\n\nEach terminal in the string must appear in one of the grammar's terminals or be derived from non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to reverse-engineer the string. Starting from the start symbol S, let's see if we can trace a way to generate the entire string.\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, we need to derive the string starting with NT88 and then NT26. Let's look at NT88's production:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nEach of these, NT8 and NT32, must produce a substring that contributes to the entire string. Let's explore NT8:\n\nLooking at NT8, its production is several options, but one of them is NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22. Wait, no, let's check:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT69 NT18. Hmm, but NT69 is another non-terminal, and NT18 is a terminal. Wait, no, looking again, actually, in the given rules, NT8's production includes NT69 and NT18, but looking deeper, NT69 might lead to 't27' through further breakdown.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me reorganize.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t30, so I need to see if any of the non-terminals when derived produce t30. Checking the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through the given terminal rules (those that have 't...'), I see:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't29'\n- NT2 \u2192 't36'\n- NT91 \u2192 't44'\n- NT72 \u2192 't33'\n- NT41 \u2192 't49'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT70 \u2192 't12'\n- NT20 \u2192 't20'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT75 \u2192 't60'\n- NT58 \u2192 't28'\n- NT98 \u2192 't45'\n- NT88 \u2192 't37'\n- NT66 \u2192 't30'\n- NT50 \u2192 't38'\n- NT55 \u2192 't52'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT19 \u2192 't19' (Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.)\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the terminal rules are given as 't' followed by some numbers. For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT70 \u2192 't12'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT98 \u2192 't45'\n- NT49 \u2192 't60'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal assignments to make it clearer.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT70 \u2192 't12'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT98 \u2192 't45'\n- NT49 \u2192 't49'? Wait, no, looking at the rules again:\n\nWait, each line seems to be a production. It might be better to create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to its production rules and which terminals they can produce.\n\nBut perhaps I can first list all the terminals and see which ones are present in the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt30, t34, t55, t34, t8, t32, t19, t53, t52, t52, t1, t2, t30, t56, t21, t12, t45, t44, t52, t9, t33.\n\nSo the terminals are t30, t34, t55, t8, t32, t19, t53, t52, t1, t2, t12, t45, t44, t56, t21, t33.\n\nNow, I should check if each of these terminals is present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the given rules, which have 't...':\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT70 \u2192 't12'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT35 \u2192 't44'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT53 \u2192 't48' (but 48 is not in our string, but the string has t45, which might not be a terminal in the grammar, but let's check.)\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT35 \u2192 't44'\n\nBut in the string, I see t45, which is not listed in any terminals. Could there be a typo? Or maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n\nBut t45 is not in the terminals. Wait, in the rules, looking for 't45':\n\nNT45 is not a non-terminal but a terminal? Wait, in the given rules, the terminal 't45' appears as part of NT58 \u2192 NT17 NT58? No, I think I'm confusing the notation.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal assignments from the rules:\n\nFrom the given rules, lines that have 't' as the content are:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 (but 4 is a number, perhaps a terminal, but not in the string's terminals)\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me go through each line:\n\nEach line is of the form A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 'tX'.\n\nSo, I need to find all lines where the production is to 'tX'.\n\nLet's parse each line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2014 nothing terminal here.\n2. NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87 \u2014 nothing terminal.\n3. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2014 nothing terminal.\n4. NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18 \u2014 NT18 \u2192 't47'. So NT41 produces through NT77 and then 't47'.\n5. NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 \u2014 NT17 \u2192 't29', NT58 \u2192 't6'? Wait, no. Let me check NT58's productions: line 58 is NT58 \u2192 NT28 NT58 or in one of the other lines... Wait, in the given rules, line 58 is: \"NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT48\" and \"NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18\". Also, \"NT18 \u2192 't47'\". So when NT18 is derived, it produces 't47'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this differently.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I recall that a context-free grammar in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The given grammar has rules like S -> NT88 NT26, NT63 -> NT48 NT87, and so on. Each of these rules produces two non-terminals, and eventually, these non-terminals must produce terminal symbols (the 't' followed by numbers or the actual literals in the string).\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t56 t30 t16 t27 t23 t27 t45 t26 t6 t29 t30 t32 t23 t48 t9 t9 t17 t34 t2 t36 t17.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the grammar rules. The process will involve starting from S and replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me first write down the grammar rules, focusing only on the non-terminals and their expansions.\n\nStarting with S:\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nSo, S must expand into two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t56, which corresponds to NT26 -> t56? Wait, in the grammar, let's check NT26. Wait, the grammar has NT26 -> NT68 NT13. Hmm, that's not a terminal yet. So, I need to find the rules for NT26, which isn't directly producing t56. Looking through the grammar rules, I see some rules like NT58 -> NT69 NT18, NT28 -> NT56, but that's a different NT28.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, I see that NT17 has a rule: 17 -> t29 in some cases, but looking at the rules, for example, NT17 -> NT63 NT50, which then needs to be expanded further.\n\nThis seems a bit tangled. Maybe I should approach this by trying to build the string step by step, keeping track of how each non-terminal can produce a part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to represent the string as a sequence of symbols and see if each symbol corresponds to a possible expansion.\n\nLet me list the string again:\n\nt56, t30, t16, t27, t23, t27, t45, t26, t6, t29, t30, t32, t23, t48, t9, t9, t17, t34, t2, t36, t17.\n\nThat's 20 symbols. Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, the number of non-terminals at each step should be 2^n, starting with 1 (S), then 2, then 4, 8, etc. But since the string length is 20, which isn't a power of two, perhaps we need multiple productions beyond the top-down approach.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to build the string bottom-up, looking at each symbol and seeing if it can be produced by any non-terminal. But considering the structure, perhaps it's easier to trace from the start.\n\nLet me try to see how each symbol in the string could be generated.\n\nStarting with S -> NT88 NT26. So, the string starts with t56, which is the first part of NT26? Wait, I need to look up the rules for NT26. Oh, in the grammar, NT26 is defined as NT68 NT13. So, to produce t56, perhaps NT13 can produce t56? Let me check the production rules for NT13. Looking through the grammar rules, NT13 has several rules, one of which is NT13 -> NT58 NT83, another is NT13 -> NT85 NT40, and another is NT13 -> NT83 NT52. Wait, none of these seem to directly produce a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking for a rule where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT7 -> t2, NT11->t4, etc. So, looking at NT26, what's its production? It's NT68 NT13. So, each of these needs to produce a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their possible productions to see which can terminate in a single symbol.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should focus on each symbol in the string and see if it can correspond to a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with t56. Looking through the grammar rules, which non-terminals can produce t56? Looking at the RHS of the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> t56. So, NT28 can produce t56.\n\nSo, t56 must come from NT28. In the string, the first part is t56. So, if I have a production that leads to t56 as the first symbol, that would be from NT28.\n\nBut earlier, looking at S -> NT88 NT26. So, the first two symbols must come from NT88 and NT26. But the first symbol is t56, which is from NT28. So, unless NT26 can produce t30 and some other symbols, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The top level is S -> NT88 NT26, so the string should start with the production of NT88 followed by NT26.\n\nBut the first symbol is t56, which is from NT28. So, perhaps NT26 produces a sequence that starts with t30. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbols are t56 t30 t16 t27 t23 t27 t45 t26 t6 t29 t30 t32 t23 t48 t9 t9 t17 t34 t2 t36 t17.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t56 (NT28), then t30 (NT30?), but is there an NT30? Wait, looking through the grammar rules provided, I don't see an NT30. The non-terminals go up to NT98, but I don't see NT30. So perhaps it's NT28 -> t56, and then what comes next?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by constructing a parse tree. Let's try that.\n\nThe string starts with t56, which is from NT28.\n\nSo, the root would be S, which splits into NT88 and NT26.\n\nThe t56 comes from NT26. Wait, no, because in the production S -> NT88 NT26, the first part of the string is t56, which should come from NT26. But looking at the grammar, NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, the first production from NT26 would be NT68 NT13. So, the first part of the string is t56, but NT68 doesn't directly produce a terminal. Instead, perhaps we have to look deeper.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if any of the non-terminals in the string directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t2\nNT11->t4\nNT17->t29\nNT28->t56\nNT30->t...\nWait, do any other non-terminals produce terminals? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' so NT7 can produce t2.\n- NT11->t4\n- NT17->t29\n- NT28->t56\n- NT20->t32\n- NT2->t36\n- NT3->t1 ... Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, some of the terminals are:\n\nLooking more closely, after checking the grammar rules, the terminals are as follows:\n\n'NT58 -> t60, NT13->t27, etc.' wait, no, the actual terminals are from the string, which are 't1', 't2', 't3', etc.\n\nIn the grammar rules, certain non-terminals produce these terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT20->t32\n- NT2->t36\n- NT91->t44\n- NT32->t73\n- NT48->t27\n- NT11->t4\n- NT17->t29\n- NT28->t56\n- ...\n- Others produce t2, t5, t8, etc.\n\nBut in the grammar, the actual mapping of non-terminals to terminals is sparse.

{"custom_id":"request-390","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's understand what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. This simplification helps in parsing algorithms and theoretical analysis.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to consist of several production rules, mostly transforming non-terminals (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals (t's and numbers). Some of the rules are straight to terminals, like NT7 -> 't27' or NT75 -> 't60'. Each production is either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t29 t12 t37 t20 t1 t9 t45 t52 t57 t9 t26 t19 t19 t60 t54 t19 t54 t33 t16 t28 t11 t23.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. So, I need to see if each terminal in the string can be derived through a series of productions starting from the start symbol, S.\n\nStarting with S, the first rule is S -> NT88 NT26. That means S can be derived into NT88 and NT26. Then, each of these non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT88, in the grammar, it seems to have a production rule: NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Similarly, NT26 has NT26 -> NT68 NT13. So after two steps, S can be expanded into NT8, NT32, NT68, and NT13.\n\nContinuing this process, each non-terminal is broken down into smaller parts until we reach terminals. Let me try to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be generated.\n\nStarting with the first part: t29. I look at the grammar for any non-terminal that directly produces 't29'. Scanning through the rules: NT17 -> 't29' on two different occasions. So NT17 can produce two t29s. That seems useful. So if we have NT17 somewhere, it can generate two 't29's, which would fit the first two 't29's in the string.\n\nNext, t12. Looking at the rules for 't12'. I notice that NT12 is part of several productions. For example, NT8 -> 't12' appears twice, and NT22 -> 't12' once. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see NT12 -> 't17' and 't23' as outputs. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules for NT12 are: NT12 -> 't17' twice and 't23' once as outputs. So 't12' doesn't directly appear as a terminal in any of the productions I checked earlier. Maybe I missed a rule where NT12 directly produces 't12'. Checking the rules again, I see that NT12's productions are NT12 -> 't17' twice and 't23' once, so no, there's no 't12' directly generated by NT12. So perhaps I need to find a way that a non-terminal produces 't12' through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT28 -> 't56' and NT70 -> 't11', etc. Wait, but I'm looking for 't12', and I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't12'. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go back to the string and see where I might have gone wrong.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't29 t12 t37...'. So 't12' is the third element after 't29'. So 't29' is generated by NT17, which gives us two 't29's. Then the next step is to generate 't12' after that. But if no non-terminal directly produces 't12', then perhaps I'm misunderstanding how to break down the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should represent the string as a list and start expanding step by step. Let's list the string as [t29, t12, t37, t20, t1, t9, t45, t52, t57, t9, t26, t19, t19, t60, t54, t19, t54, t33, t16, t28, t11, t23]. Now, I need to see if each of these terminals can be generated by appropriate productions.\n\nStarting with the first 't29', I see that NT17 can produce two 't29's. So, in the string, 't29 t29' can be the result of a single NT17. So that part is covered.\n\nNext, after the two 't29's, the next few are 't12', which I think I might have misassigned earlier. Wait, looking at the rules again, perhaps I missed a non-terminal that produces 't12'. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> 't17' twice\n- NT22 -> 't12' once? No, looking back, I think NT22 is NT22 -> 't44' and 't56', not 't12'. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for 't12' in the terminals, I go through all the rules:\n\n- Is there any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't12'? Scanning the rules:\n\nNo, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly results in 't12'. The closest is NT12 -> 't17' or 't23', which means 't12' isn't directly generated. So maybe I need to find a way that a non-terminal can generate 't12' through a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake, and I should consider that some of these terminals are generated by multiple non-terminals, and perhaps through the production chain, some non-terminal down the line can produce 't12'. Let me try to map this out more carefully.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to attempt to parse the string using the grammar, working step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 can go to 't12' but wait, from the rules, NT8 is only in one rule: NT8 -> 't12' twice? Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT8 productions: I see NT88 -> NT8 NT32, yes, and in the rules, there's NT8 -> 't12' appearing twice, right?\n\nWait, yes, in the grammar, I see NT8 has two productions: NT8 -> 't12' twice? Wait, no, let me check the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules provided, when I get to the end of the list, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me reread the provided grammar properly.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar rules in a somewhat jumbled order, so I need to parse them in order, but actually, any order. So to check, I need to look for NT8 and see what rules apply to it.\n\nLooking at the rules, under the grammar section, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me look back. Under the grammar, the user provided:\n\nNT88 -> NT88 NTsomething? Or perhaps looking further:\n\nLooking through all the rules line by line:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83\n- NT51 -> NT70 NT94\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. I'll start by understanding the grammar structure and then see how the string can be derived from it.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S -> NT88 NT26. So, to get S, I need NT88 and NT26. Now, I need to see if both of these NTs can produce something that will lead to the string.\n\nLet's break down NT88 and NT26. \n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32. So, NT88 is broken into NT8 and NT32. Now, I need to see what NT8 and NT32 produce.\n\nNT8's production is given as NT88 -> NT8 NT32 (but that's redundant, so maybe looking at NT8's other rules). Wait, looking at the productions, NT8 can be generated from NT8 itself? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the grammar might have multiple rules for some symbols, so let me check NT8 and NT32.\n\nNT8's production is not explicitly shown beyond NT88, but I notice NT94 -> t57 and NT83 -> t52.

Looking at the grammar, t52 is derived from NT55. Checking the grammar, NT55 has a production NT55 -> t8 or NT19 (not listed? Wait, looking back, the grammar includes NT55 -> t8, and perhaps others). Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT55 -> t8 and NT55 -> t52. So, t52 is one possibility for NT55.\n\nWait, let me confirm.

Looking at the grammar, NT17 has several productions, including NT63, NT29, etc. Wait, more precisely, NT17 appears in some rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT17 -> NT63 NT50, NT17 -> NT42 NT87, etc. So t17 must be from NT17, but how does nt17 derive 't17'? Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each non-terminal produces two non-terminals, except for the terminals. So 't17' is a terminal, so it must come from a production that can generate it directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 -> t42?\nWait, no.

Wait, no. Let me go through the list again:\n\nLooking at each rule, the ones that produce terminals are:\n\nNT17 -> t42\nWait, no. Let's look at each production line ending with 't':\n\nNT28 -> t56\nNT58 -> t28\nNT17 -> t54\nNT11 -> t21\nNT69 -> t27\nNT70 -> t11\nNT40 -> t6\nNT13 -> t12\nNT59 -> t15\nNT8 -> t29\nNT2 -> t36\nNT91 -> t44\nNT22 -> t44\nNT18 -> t6\nNT72 -> t33\nNT12 -> t23\nNT94 -> t23\nNT54 -> t16\nNT35 -> t44\nNT11 -> t17\nNT7 -> t2\nNT70 -> t11\nNT53 -> t48\nNT72 -> t33\nNT76 -> t55\nNT41 -> t49\nNT2 -> t34\nNT40 -> t60\nNT20 -> t20\n\nWait, so it seems NT17 is used in a production that eventually leads to t17. Wait, no. Looking more carefully, NT17 has a rule:NT17 -> NT42 NT87, and another:NT17 -> NT63 NT50.\n\nBut how do t17 or t29 come into play. Wait, looking at the bottom part, under NT17:\n\nLooking at the bottom, under NT17, there are lines like:\n\nNT54 -> t16\nNT35 -> t44\nNT11 -> t17\nSo perhaps NT17 has a production that includes t17.

Under NT94, it's NT94 -> t57. Under NT54, NT54->t16. Under NT35, NT35 -> t44. Under NT11, line says NT11 -> 't17'.

Under NT11, there's a rule: NT11->t21. No, that's t21. Hmm. Under NT17, does it produce t17?

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a start symbol S which directly goes to NT88 NT26. So, the first two non-terminals in any derivation should be NT88 and NT26. Then, each of these can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Some of these non-terminals have productions that lead to terminals (like 't1', 't4', etc.), and others continue to split into more non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t15. I need to see if there's a way the grammar can produce t15 early on. Let me check the productions for t15. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT59 has a production to NT14 NT20 and NT15 \u2192 't15'. Oh, right, NT15 directly produces t15. So maybe the string starts with NT15, which is 't15'.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S produces NT88 NT26. So the initial steps have to be from NT88 and NT26. Let me see what each of these produces. NT88 goes to NT8 NT32, and NT32 can produce 't28'. Hmm, and NT26 goes to NT68 NT13, which then has multiple options. Alternatively, maybe I can look for a path from S to t15 through some chain.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT88 and NT26. Let me check if either of these can directly produce t15, but looking through the productions, I don't see that. So maybe the string starts with t15, which must come from NT15. But that would mean that after S, somehow NT88 or NT26 can lead to NT15. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the string starts with t15. So maybe in the derivation, the first two symbols are produced by NT88 and NT26 through some chain that leads to t15 and t52 or something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to see if there's a way for these non-terminals to generate t15 and something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial productions for S are NT88 NT26, and each of them branches out, but the string starts with t15, which is a terminal. So to get t15, that non-terminal must be NT15, as per the production NT15 \u2192 t15.\n\nSo let me see where NT15 can come from. Looking at the grammar, there's a production NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20 and NT59 \u2192 t15. Also, NT14 \u2192 NT52 NT86 and more. But wait, to have NT15, perhaps it's via a chain. For example, maybe NT88 can produce something that leads to NT59, then NT59 produces t15.\n\nSo let me see:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNT32 \u2192 't28' or can it go further? From NT32, perhaps another production? Let me check: in the productions, NT32 \u2192 NT48 NT20 (Wait, looking through, I see NT48 \u2192 't27'? Or wait, perhaps I'm misremembering. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking back, in the production list, I see multiple NTs, some with terminals and some without. For example, NT17 \u2192 't29' etc.\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions, so let's check for NT15. Oh, yes, NT15 \u2192 t15. But how does NT59 \u2192 t15 fit in. So if NT59 can produce t15, and NT59 can be reached via some other production, then S could derive into something that starts with t15.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nIf NT88 can produce a path leading to NT59, then yes. Let's see: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' (from productions, NT8 \u2192 't29').\n\nSo NT88 can go to 't29' NT32.\n\nThen NT32 \u2192 let's see, from the list: I think NT32 could produce 't28'? Or does it go on further? Let me check: Looking up, I see NT28 \u2192 't56', but that's from NT28. Wait, maybe I got mixed up.\n\nWait, NT32 \u2192 NT48 NT20 (I think that's from the list, yes). So NT32 \u2192 NT48 NT20.\n\nThen NT48 \u2192 't2' NT98 or NT48 \u2192 't59' NT98 or something else? Wait, looking at the list, I seeNT48 \u2192 't27'...

{"custom_id":"request-410","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can also be a single terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nThe grammar provided has a bunch of S and NT productions, and some of them produce terminal symbols (like 't2', 't33', etc.). The string to evaluate is \"t2 t33 t26 t53 t8 t8 t60 t55 t8 t17 t45 t28 t53 t19 t11 t52 t54 t1 t44 t25 t47 t20 t27\".\n\nI think the process here involves trying to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's a CFG, a recursive descent parser or some kind of top-down parsing might work. Alternatively, maybe the CYK algorithm, but I'm not too familiar with that. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent might be easier.\n\nLet me write down the string to see its structure. The string is a sequence of 21 tokens. Each token seems to be a terminal symbols like t2, t33, etc. So, the string is a list of 21 terminals.\n\nSince S is the start symbol and the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process should be such that each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and this continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must start with derivations that begin with these two NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, in the string, the first token is t2. Let me check what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo, S starts as NT88 and NT26. Each of these produces two NTs. Let's see:\n\nFor NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\nThen, NT8 (if possible) produces... Looking at the productions, I see that NT8 doesn't produce anything? Wait, no, let me check all NTs.\n\nActually, I realize that some of the productions are defined in terms of other NTs. But I think I might be confusing something. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the parse starts with these two. The string must then be the concatenation of the leftmost derivation of NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, the string is t2 t33 t26... but wait, that's not necessarily the case. The initial parse would have NT88 derivating to some sequence and NT26 to another.\n\nI need to see how each NT can produce the sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model it as a tree. The entire string should be the concatenation of the two NT88 and NT26 sequences.\n\nWait, no. The initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so both NT88 and NT26 must produce some strings. The overall string is the concatenation of these two strings. So, the string should be the first part (from NT88) followed by the second part (from NT26).\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t2, which I think is the start of NT88's production.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Now, I need to see what NT8 and NT32 produce.\n\nBut wait, looking through the productions:\n\n- NT8 doesn't have any production listed except under others. Wait, actually, some lines refer to NT8. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8: Let's scan all entries. I don't see NT8 as a node; I see NT14, NT42, etc. Wait, I might have missed it. Let me scan the entire list again.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI don't see any direct production for NT8. Hmm. Maybe I missed it. Let me check each line.\n\nLooking at the first few:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-430","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. So, each step in the derivation only replaces a single symbol with two others or a terminal. \n\nThe string to check is: `t56 t25 t6 t49 t2 t1 t60 t26 t15 t4 t52 t36 t60 t56 t6 t1 t44 t54 t15 t28 t56 t45 t36 t25`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Let me look at the productions. The start symbol is S, and the first production is S -> NT88 NT26. So, to derive any string, we start by expanding S into NT88 and NT26. Each of these, in turn, will be expanded further until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at NT88, one of its productions is NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Then NT88 also has another production NT88 -> NT56 NT6. Wait, but in the string, I see t56 appears twice. Let me check the NT88 productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT88 has two productions: NT88 -> NT8 NT32 and NT88 -> NT56 NT6. So, NT88 can be replaced by two different pairs. \n\nThe string starts with t56 and t25. Let me see where t56 and t25 come from. In the productions, I see NT25: looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT25, but there is NT56 -> t38. Wait, not NT25, but let's check if any of the non-terminals can produce t56 and t25. \n\nLooking through the grammar, NT56 is a production NT56 -> t38, but wait, that's for NT56. Hmm, wait, looking at the productions, I see NT56: NT56 -> t6, which is different. Wait, no, that's not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me go through the grammar systematically. \n\nLooking for production NT25: Wait, do any non-terminals produce t25? Let me scan the list. I see NT25 is not present as a non-terminal, but I do see NT28 -> t25. Wait, but the production is NT28: \"NT28 -> NT48 NT56\", and NT48 and NT56 can then be expanded into terminals. So, NT28 can produce \"t48 ...\". Hmm, wait, no, let me see. \n\nWait, in the grammar, it says NT28 -> 't56'. Wait, no, looking back: \"NT28 -> 't56'\"? Let me check the rules. Yes, under NT28: \"NT28 -> 't56'\". So, NT28 can produce t56, but where does t25 come from? \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all the terminal productions in the grammar because I need to trace how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are all the terminal substitutions:\n\nNT7 -> t2  \nNT70 -> t11  \nNT22 -> t44  \nNT41 -> t49  \nNT40 -> t60  \nNT20 -> t20  \nNT8 -> t29  \nNT11 -> t30  \nNT66 -> t30  \nNT55 -> t54  \nNT8 -> t54  \nNT72 -> t33  \nNT12 -> t17  \nNT8 -> t6  \nNT97 -> t4  \nNT94 -> t57  \nNT51 -> t39  \nNT2 -> t36  \nNT91 -> t44  \nNT18 -> t26  \nNT12 -> t23  \nNT72 -> t23  \nNT94 -> t23  \nNT54 -> t16  \nNT13 -> t12  \nNT59 -> t15  \nNT72 -> t38  \nNT58 -> t28  \nNT98 -> t45  \nNT88 -> t37  \nNT86 -> t9  \nNT83 -> t52  \nNT33 -> t1  \nNT28 -> t25  \nNT48 -> t27  \nNT11 -> t17  \nNT69 -> t27  \nNT50 -> t38  \nNT35 -> t44  \nNT58 -> t11  \nNT11 -> t17  \nNT7 -> t2  \nNT70 -> t11  \nNT53 -> t48  \nNT72 -> t33  \nNT76 -> t55  \nNT22 -> t44  \nNT41 -> t49  \nNT40 -> t60  \nNT20 -> t20  \nAnd some non-terminals have t35, t36, etc., but for the string, the only t's are t56, t25, t6, t49, t2, t1, t60, etc.\n\nSo, let's see which non-terminals produce t56 and t25.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT28 produces t56, as per \"NT28 -> 't56'\". So, any non-terminal that can expand into NT28 will produce t56. \n\nAlso, NT25 is a non-terminal that I'm trying to find. Wait, in the productions, I don't see NT25, but maybe it's derived from another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps NT25 is created through a chain. Let me check again. Wait, in the given grammar, I see NT25: no, looking through all the productions, I don't see NT25 as a non-terminal. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, I see NT25 doesn't appear. So, how can the string have t25? Because in the list above, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t25. Wait, but looking again at the productions: NT28 -> 't56', which is directly a terminal. So, to get t25, we must have NT25 directly expanding to t25, but that's not in the grammar. So that means, perhaps, I've made a mistake here.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar again, I see that NT25 is not present. Instead, I see NT28: \"NT28 -> 't56'\". So, there's no way to produce t25 unless perhaps another non-terminal produces it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT25: No, it's not present. The closest is NT28: \"NT28 -> 't56'\". So t25 is not directly produced by any non-terminal in the given grammar. Wait, but perhaps t25 is a typo, but assuming the string is correct, I have to figure out if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me double-check:\n\nLooking through all the NT definitions:\n\nNT7, NT70, NT22, NT41, NT40, NT20, NT8, NT11, NT66, NT55, NT8, NT72, NT12, NT8, NT97, NT94, NT51, NT2, NT91, NT18, NT12, NT72, NT94, NT54, NT13, NT59, NT72, NT58, NT98, NT88, NT86, NT83, NT33, NT28, NT48, NT11, NT69, NT50, NT35, NT58, NT73, NT55, NT40, NT42, NT17, NT54, NT8, NT72, NT12, NT8, NT97, NT94, NT51, NT2, NT91, NT18, NT12, NT72, NT94, NT54, NT13, NT59, NT72, NT58, NT98, NT88, NT86, NT83, NT98, etc.\n\nWait, so none of the NTs directly produce t25. So, if the string has t25, unless we have a non-terminal that produces it directly, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but looking again, perhaps I'm misreading the NT25. Let me check each production line again.\n\nLooking through each NT definition, for example:\n\n\"NT17 -> NT63 NT58\"\n\n\"NT58 -> NT33 NT4\"\n\nNope, nothing for NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-437","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t47 t54 t60 t26 t1 t47 t55 t23 t23 t28 t29 t49 t29 t28 t39 t29 t8 t26 t18 t6 t39 t8 t25` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is doing. It looks like a set of production rules where symbols on the left side expand into combinations of other symbols on the right. Some symbols seem to be terminal because they directly translate to 't' followed by a number, like 't47' or 't1'. Others like 'NT63' are non-terminals because they don't appear on the right side as terminals but as other NT symbols.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which expands into NT88 and NT26. So the string must start with something that comes from NT88 or NT26. Both these NT symbols seem to eventually resolve into terminals, but I need to check how they branch.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that many NT symbols have right-hand sides with other NT symbols. For example, NT88 -> NT8 NT32, and NT32 -> NT73 NT42, and so on. So to build the string, each step involves breaking down these NT symbols until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t47`, which I guess corresponds to a terminal. Let's see which NT rule ends with 't47'. Looking through the terminal rules, I see that NT47 isn't listed, but looking at other NTs, I notice that some end with 't' numbers. For example, NT4 -> NT20 NT22, but NT22 is a terminal 't34', etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, maybe 't47' comes from NT18's rule? NT18 -> NT66 NT55, and then NT66 is a terminal 't30', NT55 is 't54'. But NT55 also appears as NT55 -> 't8' in another rule? Wait, no, in the list, I see multiple entries. Let me list out the terminals and see where they come from.\n\nLooking through the NT production rules, I see that some NTs directly produce terminals. Like:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT11 -> 't4'\n- NT17 -> 't29'\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT26 -> 't26'? Wait, no, looking back: no, NT26 is 't18'? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the terminals:\n\n- NT18 -> 't47' because in the production for NT18: NT18 -> NT66 NT55, and both NT66 is 't30' and NT55 is 't54', but wait, in the terminals section, I see NT18 -> 't47'? Or is that another rule? Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the given rules, looking for 't47':\n\nI see:\n\n- NT18: NT18 -> NT66 NT55, which are non-terminals, but then later in the list, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n\nWait, no, looking through the list of rules, it's more like:\n\nNT18: NT18 -> 't47'\n\nYes, in the part where NT18 is defined, under 'NT18', it's written as 't47'. Similarly, NT48: 't27', and so on for other NT symbols.\n\nSo, the string starts with 't47', which would have to come from NT18. So let's track back where NT18 comes from.\n\nLooking back, NT18 -> NT66 NT55 (non-terminals) and something else? No, in the rules, I see NT18 is defined as 't47'. So in the string, the first word is 't47', which is terminal, so it must be produced by NT18. So NT18 must be the starting point of a derivation.\n\nWait, no, because the initial symbol is S, which expands to NT88 and NT26. So to get to NT18, we'd have to expand NT88 or NT26 into something that can reach NT18.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 is 't29', but wait NT8 is a terminal. NT32 -> NT73 NT42. Let's see where NT73 and NT42 lead.\n\nNT73 -> 't52' and NT42 -> 't28'. So NT32 would expand to 't52 t28', resulting in 't52t28'.\n\nSo NT88 would become 't29 t52 t28'.\n\nWait, but NT88 -> NT8 and NT32. So when you expand NT88, it becomes 't29' followed by NT32, which then becomes 't52' and 't28'. So NT88 would produce 't29 t52 t28'.\n\nBut in the string, the first part is 't47 t54 t60 t26 t1...', which starts with 't47' not 't29'. So that can't be from NT88.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.\n\nThe initial S expands to NT88 NT26. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo the string starts with 't47', which is the first symbol. Let's see if any of the expansions from NT88 or NT26 can lead to 't47'.\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 -> NT68 NT13. Let's see where NT68 and NT13 go.\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54: Looking at terminal rules, I see NT55->'t8', but wait NT54 isn't directly a terminal. Wait, no: the terminal rules are for specific NT IDs, so NT54 is a non-terminal that leads to non-terminals, not a terminal. So NT68 would expand into NT54 and NT28.\n\nNT28 -> 't56'.\n\nSo NT68 becomes NT54 followed by 't56'.\n\nThen NT54: I think NT54 is 't16', because in the rules, NT54 -> 't16'? Wait, no:\n\nLooking through the terminal list, I see:\n\n- NT54 -> 't16'? Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, for example:\n\nNT54: I don't see any line starting with 't16' in the terminal rules. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The terminal rules are for NTs like NT18, NT2, etc. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT70 -> 't12'\n\n- NT73 -> 't52'\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n\n- NT11 -> 't4'\n\n- NT17 -> 't29'\n\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n\n- NT26 -> 't26' - Wait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see NT26 as a terminal. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the rules list has lines like:\n\nNT28 -> 't56'\n\nNT68 -> 't54' and 't28'\n\nSo for NT88 -> NT8 and NT32, which is 't29' followed by NT32, which is NT73 and NT42, which are 't52' and 't28', so NT88 would expand to 't29 t52 t28'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't47', which would come from NT18. So maybe the first part comes from a different NT.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol 't47' comes from NT18, but NT18 is in S's expansion? No, S is the start symbol and can't directly produce terminals. It can only produce NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by some intermediate NT that leads to T47.

It seems to consist of a series of productions where each non-terminal (NT) expands into two other non-terminals, except for some that directly produce terminal symbols ('t' followed by a number or individual 't's). \n\nLooking at the production rules, most of the NTs eventually break down into sequences starting with 't'. For example, `NT7 -> NT11 NT22`, and these NTs in turn resolve to 't19' and 't44'. So, the entire string is built from these 't's and the NT productions.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 25 't' terms. Each 't' must correspond to a terminal that's the endpoint of an NT production. To verify, I'll check if each 't' in the string is accounted for by the grammar.\n\nLet me list each 't' and see which NT they come from:\n\n- `t19`: From NT17 (NT17 -> NT63 NT58, which eventually breaks down to 't17' and 't58', but wait, NT17 also has another production like NT17 -> NT42 NT87. Hmm, maybe I should track each path.\n\nWait, let me try to see if each 't' in the string is reachable from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26.\n\nThen each of those (NT88 and NT26) are further broken down into their components. Let's see:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83\n- NT75 -> NT55 NT79\n- NT55 -> NT18 NT54\n- NT55 -> NT54 (from another production)\n- NT18 -> NT66 NT55\n- Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should map the entire string and see if each 't' can be linked to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a parse tree, but it's time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to construct a parse tree for the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that S produces NT88 NT26, the string begins with NT88, which expands into NT8 and NT32. NT8 is 't29', but the string starts with 't19', so that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the start symbol S produces NT88 and NT26. Each of those must be expanded into terminals. The string starts with 't19', which must be a terminal resulting from one of the NTs. So, let me see which NTs produce 't19'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT13 -> NT85 NT40, and among other productions, NT13 is listed as `NT13 -> t12`, but wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, some NTs directly produce terminals. For example, `NT2 -> 't36'`, `NT4 -> 't54'`, etc. Looking through all the NTs, I see that some produce 't' followed by a number. \n\nI'll make a list of which NTs produce which 't's:\n\n- NT17 -> 't17'\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT3 -> 't5' (Wait, did I miss that? Looking through the productions, there's `NT32 -> NT73 NT42` but not a terminal. Maybe other NTs. Let me go through each production and note the terminals.\n\nI think it's better to list all NTs and their possible terminal productions:\n\n- NT17 -> 't17', 't29' (from NT17 -> NT63 NT58 and other productions)\n- NT2 -> 't36', 't46', 't6' (various)\n- NT4 -> 't54', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't2', 't53', etc.\n- NT13 -> 't12', 't47', 't58'\n- NT17 -> 't17', 't29', 't42', etc.\nWait, this seems too time-consuming. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be derived step by step.\n\nThe string is 25 't's. Wait, the original production for S is NT88 NT26. Let's see what each of these produces.\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n  - NT8 -> 't29' or other possibilities\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n  - NT68 -> NT54 NT28\n    - NT54 -> NT13 NT55\n    - NT28 -> 't25' or others\n  - NT13 -> 't12', etc.\n\nThis quickly gets complicated. Maybe the string is too long, and some of the 't's can't be derived because the grammar doesn't produce that number.\n\nLooking at the string, for example, 't19' is not directly produced by any NT in the grammar. Let me check: do any NTs produce 't19'? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't19'. So if the string requires 't19', and there's no production for that, the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, 't19' isn't present in the grammar's terminal productions. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I miss any NT that produces 't19'? Scanning the grammar, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly produces 't19'. Therefore, 't19' must not be part of any string generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-456","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the grammar looks like. It consists of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT63, etc.) is rewritten into two other non-terminals or terminals. The end-of-string marker 't' seems to indicate terminal symbols, and the rest are non-terminals. Each production is of the form A -> BC, which fits CNF.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t29 t32 t30 t28 t47 t38 t15 t21 t15 t27 t49 t25 t55 t20 t45 t36 t20 t20 t45 t23 t21 t12 t15 t19 t2`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in a derivation corresponds to replacing a non-terminal with two others. So, for a string of length n, the derivation tree should have n-1 non-terminals. Wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Each production rule introduces exactly two symbols, so a string of length m would have m-1 productions, but it's more about the fact that each non-terminal expansion adds two symbols.\n\nWait, let's see: The starting symbol is S, which according to the first rule is NT88 NT26. So S divides into two parts, each of which can be further expanded. The process builds up the string step by step, with each expansion doubling the number of symbols or something like that.\n\nLooking at the given string, its length is 26 symbols. So the derivation must start with S -> NT88 NT26, which would be two symbols, and then each step replaces a non-terminal with two smaller ones until we reach 26 symbols. So, that makes sense. So for a string of length 26, the number of non-terminals in the derivation path would be 25, which matches the 25 non-terminals in the initial step.\n\nNow, to check the string, perhaps it's easier to reverse the process. I'll try to parse the string from right to left, using the reverse of the grammar rules. This is called the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is small, maybe I can do it manually.\n\nBut I need to look at the terminal symbols given. The string uses t2 through t59, and some are repeated. Each terminal corresponds to a non-terminal symbol in the grammar. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and the non-terminals in the grammar can only appear in specific ways.\n\nWait, another approach is to check if each terminal in the string is allowed. For example, looking at the rules, each non-terminal can expand into two others until we get to terminals. So, each non-terminal is either a terminal or can be further broken down.\n\nLooking at the given string, all the terminals are like t3, t4, t5, etc. So first, I should check if all these terminals are present in the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me go through the first few symbols of the string: t29, t32, t30, t28. I need to see if t29 is a terminal. Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminals that expand into t29. Wait, maybe I should list all the terminals.\n\nThe terminals are the right-hand sides that are terminals, so from the rules:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, some have 't' followed by numbers.\n\nWait, some rules end with terminals. For example:\n\nNT7 -> NT59 NT58 (but NT58 is a non-terminal, so it might expand further)\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58 (expand further)\n...\nNT72 -> NT22 NT48\n...\nLooking through all the right-hand sides, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't2' (so t2 is a terminal)\nNT17 -> 't4' and others\nNT8 -> 't29' (I think)\nWait, let's see: From the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see some that end with a terminal.\n\nFor example: NT73 -> 't29' \u2014 that's a terminal, t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT52 -> 't28' (since NT52->? Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT73 -> 't29' \u2014 that means t29 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nLooking for other 't' rules:\n\n- NT52 -> 't28'\n- NT56 is in 't56' via 39 -> 't54', 59->'t54', etc. Hmm.\nWait, let me list all terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT7 -> 't2' (t2 is terminal)\nNT17 -> 't4'\nNT5 -> 't6' (but NT5 is not in the given grammar rules.

{"custom_id":"request-476","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm just starting to learn about this, so let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has production rules where each production is either a single terminal, two terminals, or a non-terminal. So each production for a non-terminal looks like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's pretty extensive. Each line starts with a non-terminal and produces either two non-terminals or something else. For example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t15 t55 t4 t54 t20 t21 t18 t45 t25 t37 t60 t55 t56 t9 t11 t25 t4 t53 t39 t53 t6 t16 t25 t37 t29 t1`. That's 27 tokens, all of which are identifiers like t15, t55, etc. Each of these seems to represent a terminal symbol.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step appends either a terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is to one non-terminal or two non-terminals. So to get terminals, the only way is to have a production that eventually leads to a terminal in the rules.\n\nBut wait, in the provided grammar, the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or maybe a mix. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is written as NTxxx -> something. So all the non-terminals start with NT (which I think might be an error, but maybe it's just a notation). So, for example, NT88 -> NT88 is followed by NT26. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, each production is NTxy -> something, which is either two NTs or a mix.\n\nBut wait, some productions have both NT and terminals. For example, in the grammar, some lines are like NT22 -> 't44'. Wait, no, because in the first line, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, that's two NTs. But then looking lower, I see lines like NT7 -> NT11 NT22, another NT production. But others have mixtures, like NT85 -> NT17 NT58, which is two NTs. But wait, I think maybe I messed up, perhaps the grammar allows for terminals in productions.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or A \u2192 B where B and C are non-terminals. But a single terminal is already a production. So in the given grammar, all productions are either two NTs or a terminal. Wait, looking at the first few lines:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87 \u2192 two NTs. Wait, here we have NT17 producing two NTs again?\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT85 NT40 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 \u2192 two NTs.\n- NT76 seems to be NT76 \u2192 NT35 NT73? Wait, but looking exactly, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check:\n\nLooking again, I see lines like NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48. So these are all two NTs. Then towards the bottom, I see lines that seem to have a mix, for example:\n\n- NT7 -> NT2 \u2192 t2, no, wait, in the given grammar, some lines end with 't', like NT22 -> 't44'? Or does it? Let me look at the grammar:\n\nLooking here: \"NT22 -> 't44'\", yes, I see that. Similarly, other rules have 't' as terminals.\n\nSo the grammar allows both two non-terminals and a termination. So for some non-terminals, their productions can result in either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions must be of the form A\u2192BC, A\u2192a. So each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo in the given grammar, each production is either a non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals, or a non-terminal \u2192 a terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking back:\n\nFor example, NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48 (two non-terminals), which fits A\u2192BC.\n\nBut then, looking further, some NT rules end with a terminal, like:\n\nNT75 \u2192 't70'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Or does the 't' refer to a terminal symbol?\n\nWait, in the grammar, the right-hand sides have either NT terms or 't' followed by numbers. So for example, NT75 \u2192 't70' would mean that NT75 produces the terminal 't70'.\n\nBut wait, in that case, some non-terminals directly go to a single terminal. So the grammar is in CNF because each rule is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nWait, let's confirm that. Chomsky Normal Form requires that each production is of the form A\u2192BC (two non-terminals) or A\u2192a (a single terminal), where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production is either one terminal or two non-terminals. So, for example:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 A\u2192BC\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22 \u2192 A\u2192BC\n\n- NT75 \u2192 't70' \u2192 A\u2192a\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't27' \u2192 A\u2192a\n\nBut wait, let me check some lines:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48 \u2192 BC\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't33' \u2192 a\n\nSo, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the string t15 t55 t4 t54 t20 t21 t18 t45 t25 t37 t60 t55 t56 t9 t11 t25 t4 t53 t39 t53 t6 t16 t25 t37 t29 t1 is generated by this grammar.\n\nTo do that, I can approach this step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree would have to consist of nodes that each produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo the string is 27 tokens. Since terminals are just single letters, each step in the parse tree either consumes two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nLet me think about how the parse tree would look.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which in the grammar is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S produces two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26.\n\nEach of these NTs would, in turn, be defined in the grammar.\n\nI can build a parse tree by recursively expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut instead of building the entire parse tree manually, perhaps I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that in CNF, the length of the string must be n \u2265 2^k where k is the height of the parse tree, but that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar given, it seems to follow CNF because each left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string provided is: `t17 t30 t28 t47 t19 t34 t39 t56 t57 t23 t12 t57 t49 t57 t44 t49 t33 t11 t47 t8 t47 t48 t47 t11 t2 t16`\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar. \n\nI start by looking at the production rules for the start symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must start with the combinations that NT88 and NT26 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t17. I need to see which production rules can lead to t17. Wait, but in CNF, the productions don't directly produce terminals except for single tokens. So, I think I need to trace back from the tokens to see if they can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be generated by the rules. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down step by step using the production rules.\n\nLet me list the tokens and see if I can find the rules that generate them.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the first symbol must be derived from NT88 and the second from NT26. Wait, no\u2014CNF allows two non-terminals, so S is NT88 producing a terminal part and NT26 another. Wait, no\u2014each symbol in S must be a non-terminal, which then produces other symbols. So, S is broken down into two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. So the first part of the string should be generated by NT88 and the second by NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t17. But in the grammar, NT17 has a production rule: NT17 \u2192 t54. Wait, no, let's see. The production rules provided show that NT17 is used elsewhere, but I need to find the production that leads to a terminal token.\n\nWait, I think I need to find which NT production rules directly generate a terminal token. Let's look through the grammar:\n\nLooking for any rule where RHS is a single terminal:\n- NT90 \u2192 't56' (but the given string doesn't have t56)\n- NT98 \u2192 't41' (but again, the string has t47, etc.)\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing NT with the terminals. Let's see:\n\nLooking at all the production rules, for example:\nNT17 \u2192 t54. That means when NT17 is derived, it produces t54. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't56', NT58 \u2192 't11', NT66 \u2192 't30', NT13 \u2192 t12, etc.\n\nSo, the terminals are 't1', 't2', 't3'... up to 't98' as per the rules. Wait, no, that seems off. Wait, no, the terminals are given as specific strings like 't17', 't28', etc. So in the grammar, certain NT symbols produce a specific terminal string. So, for example, NT17 can produce 't29', or maybe 't54'\u2014depending on the rules. Let me check.\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t54. So, NT17 generates the string 't54'. Also, looking at the string, the first token is t17. Wait, but t17 is a terminal, but in the grammar, do any NT or S symbols produce 't17'? Looking through, I don't see any NT rule producing 't17' directly. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, wait\u2014let me clarify. The given string is a sequence of tokens like 't17', 't30', etc. Each of these is a terminal symbol. The grammar defines how non-terminals can produce these terminals. So, for example, NT17 can produce the terminal 't54', so any occurrence of NT17 in a production will be replaced by 't54' when fully expanded.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first token is 't17'. But looking through the grammar, none of the rules start with 't17' on the RHS. Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string's symbols are the results of the NT productions, and the 't's correspond to the terminal symbols.\n\nSo, for example, if NT17's production is 't54', then in the string, 't54' would be a token. But in the given string, we have various 't' tokens. So, for example, 't17' appears at the start.\n\nWait a minute\u2014that doesn't make sense because in the grammar, NT17's production is looking for a 't54', so that would produce a different token. So maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string fits into the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar, some NT symbols produce a terminal directly, so if in the string a 't' is part of the left-hand side, that can't be. No, the left-hand sides are all non-terminals, so the 't's must result from the expansion of non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me approach it differently. Since the string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, each token is a terminal. So the way the grammar works is that each non-terminal produces some sequence of terminals (since it's in CNF, each rule is either two non-terminals or a terminal). So to produce a string of terminals, we start from S, which is NT88 and NT26. So the entire string must be derived from the combination of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't17'. Let's see if 't17' can be derived from any of the rules. Wait, the rules for NT17 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 rules: \n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t54. So NT17 can produce 't54'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't17', not 't54', so perhaps that token can't be derived from any rule. Let me check all NT rules to see which produce 't17'. Looking through, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't17' as a terminal. Let me go through the rules one by one.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t59, because NT7 \u2192 t53 (maybe I'm mixing up terms). Wait, looking carefully:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 't11'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT55 \u2192 't6'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT90 \u2192 't56'\n- NT22 \u2192 't44'\n- NT12 \u2192 't17' \u2190 Wait, NT12 \u2192 t17! Yes! So NT12 can produce 't17'. So if the string has 't17' somewhere, it might be generated by NT12.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't17', which would need to come from NT12. But looking at the production rules, NT12 \u2192 't17', so yes, NT12 can produce that.\n\nSo maybe the string starts with NT12. But the start symbol S is NT88 and NT26. So, perhaps NT26 in the start rules produces NT12. Or is there a rule for NT26 that can produce a combination that includes NT12 and another NT that would expand into the remaining part of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string as a product of NT88 and NT26, and check how they can generate the string.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, so I need to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this structure, as most rules are two non-terminals on the right side, and some have terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t17 t23 t38 t55 t26 t33 t12 t54 t12 t18 t47 t56 t19 t52 t36 t32 t47 t54 t25 t45 t34 t49 t15 t56 t15 t32 t20`.\n\nI think the approach is to see if I can parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary grammar, meaning each production has at most two non-terminals. Parsing such grammars can be done using a recursive descent parser or a method like the CYK algorithm, but since this is a single string, maybe a top-down approach like recursive descent would work.\n\nAlternatively, since all the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must consist of terminals, and every occurrence of a non-terminal must be generated by a production rule. So perhaps I should check if the string can be generated by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string must start with the concatenation of the strings generated by NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me break down each part:\n\n1. NT88: From the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So we need to generate the string from NT88 by expanding NT8 and NT32.\n\nNT8: Looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 't29' (from the grammar) or also NT8 \u2192 NT94 NT47 (though that's more steps). Wait, looking at the grammar, no, NT8 is actually a terminal, as per the provided rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking back: The rules for N terminals are given, and under NT8, it's written 't29', so NT8 \u2192 t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 \u2192 't56' or another rule? Let me see: Under NT32, it's written 't56'. So NT32 \u2192 t56.\n\nSo NT88 \u2192 t29 t56.\n\nWait, but let me check the grammar again. The rules are written as:\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18\nNT7 -> NT59 NT58\nNT48 -> NT59 NT98\nNT7 -> NT87 NT97\nNT87 -> NT76 NT35\nNT90 -> NT91 NT68\nNT98 -> NT86 NT4\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood. Let me make sure. For NT8, the production is either:\n\nLooking back at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking for NT8 in the rules. Let me scan through the entries:\n\nLooking for NT8... Hmm, I don't see an entry for NT8 directly. Wait, no, the NT8's rule isn't directly listed. Oh, but maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, under 'NT7' we have NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22. Similarly, other N terminals have direct terminal productions or other N rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again:\n\nWait, looking for NT8:\n\nThe initial rules provided don't include NT8, but let me look. For example, NT8 is not directly in the list, but for NT8, let me see. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I don't see an NT8 production. So perhaps NT8 is a terminal. But in the rules, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\nNT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\nNT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72\nNT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\nWait, maybe I'm not seeing it. Wait, let me go through each production rule and see if I can find NT8.\n\nLooking through all the entries, I only see NT17, NT18, NT20, etc., but not NT8. Wait, maybe it's a terminal. Because NT8 isn't on the left side of any production except perhaps none. So perhaps NT8 is a terminal symbol, which is allowed in CNF. Similarly, other N terminals may be terminals or have further productions.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So if NT88 is a two-symbol string, each of which could be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Now, if NT8 is a terminal (since it's written as 't29'), then NT8 \u2192 't29', and NT32 \u2192 't56' as per the rules given. So NT88 would produce 't29 t56'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So we need to expand NT68 and NT13.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. So NT68 expands to that.\n\nSo let's start building the string:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 (NT8 NT32) (NT68 NT13) \u2192 (t29 t56) (NT54 NT28 NT13)\n\nNow, NT28 \u2192 NT25 NT48. So:\n\n\u2192 (t29 t56) (NT54 NT25 NT48 NT13)\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT16 NT13.\n\nSo:\n\n\u2192 (t29 t56) (NT16 NT13 NT25 NT48 NT13)\n\nNow, NT16: Looking through the rules, I don't see NT16. Maybe it's a terminal. If so, then:\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, I don't see NT16 having a production, so perhaps NT16 is a terminal. But in the string, I don't see a 't16' node, so maybe it's not present.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm wrong. Let me check all the rules for any NT16.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1', but that's for NT33. So for NT16, I don't see it in the left side of any rule except perhaps a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe NT16 is a terminal. If so, then NT16 is a terminal, so it would have to be present in the string, but looking at the given string, I don't see any 't16' in it. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier in expanding. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's see if it's possible to generate the entire string step by step.\n\nLet me note that in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and each of these N's can be expanded further until terminals are reached.\n\nBut perhaps I can check for each NT whether it's a terminal or not.\n\nAlternative approach: For each NT in the string, see if it has a production that would allow it to be generated from the grammar rules.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so each of the NT's must resolve to a terminal somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using CYK parsing to check if the string is in the language. But since the problem is specific, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe to check if each element in the string can be generated by the NT rules.\n\nWait, but this might take a long time. Let me try the CYK approach.\n\nFirst, I'll list the string as tokens: t17, t23, t38, t55, t26, t33, t12, t54, t12, t18, t47, t56, t19, t52, t36, t32, t47, t54, t25, t45, t34, t49, t15, t56, t15, t32, t20.\n\nNow, first, I need to list all possible N terminals and see if they can appear in the expansion.\n\nFirst, check each token and see if it appears as a terminal in any rule.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't1', 't2', etc.:\n\n- 't17' appears under NT17 \u2192 t42 t87 \u2192 wait, no, NT17 is a non-terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, I see rules like NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87. So if NT17 is replaced, it produces two non-terminals, not terminals.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure this out. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific way a grammar is structured, where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This simplification makes it easier to analyze the grammar and sometimes allows for more straightforward parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see several non-terminals (like S, NT26, NT63, etc.) and both non-terminals and terminals (indicated by 't' followed by numbers). Each production seems to be a combination of two non-terminals on the left and possibly a terminal on the right.

{"custom_id":"request-518","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether this string is generated by the given grammar. The string provided is: `t55 t37 t49 t44 t32 t39 t32 t12 t18 t29 t19 t19 t60 t33 t53 t29 t29 t45 t26 t36 t45 t15 t34 t39 t45 t19 t16 t49`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S which goes to two non-terminals. This is helpful because it simplifies the process of parsing the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, the non-terminals are prefixed with 'NT', and some of them eventually produce terminal symbols. The string consists of a series of these terminal symbols, which include 't' followed by numbers and some have 't' alone like 't4', 't34', etc. \n\nThe first step is to see where each 't' part in the string can come from. The grammar uses 't' to denote terminal symbols, and some of these 't' parts are terminals, like 't4', 't17', etc. So each 't' part must be matched to the production rules that produce those terminals.\n\nLet me list out all the 't's in the string and see what they correspond to. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. t55: I see in the grammar that NT79 -> t22 t48, but that doesn't have 55. Looking through the rules, NT58 -> t33 t4, but 55 isn't there. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let's check all the 't's.\n\nGoing through the rules, I can create a mapping for each terminal and which NT rule produces them. For example, NT77 -> t33 t79, which would give 't33 t79' when expanded. But I need to go through each 't' in the string and see if there's a corresponding production rule that can produce it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reverse-engineer the string. The string is a sequence of terminals, so in a CNF grammar, each step of the derivation splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, and so on, until we get to terminals. Since the string is long, maybe it's a good idea to see how the grammar can generate a sequence that matches these 't' parts.\n\nBut this approach might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see how the string can be built from it. \n\nS -> NT88 NT26. Let's see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nLooking at NT88: The rules don't show NT88, but maybe it's a typo? Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT88 -> t8 t32. So NT88 produces 't8' followed by 't32'. Similarly, NT26 -> t32 t13.\n\nSo S would produce 't8 t32' (from NT88) and 't32 t13' (from NT26). So the entire string from S would be the concatenation of these two: 't8 t32 t32 t13'. But our string starts with 't55 t37...', which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I got the structure wrong. In CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the right. So starting from S, it's NT88 NT26, which would then each split into two more, and so on. So the process is recursive, splitting each non-terminal into two until reaching terminals.\n\nGiven the string is 30 't's, maybe it's built from a derivation that splits 14 times to get 2^14 symbols, but that's way longer than 30, so perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the string is a linear sequence built step by step, but CNF doesn't directly allow that; it's more of a tree.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to check if each 't' in the string can be matched by some production. Let's try each 't' one by one.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model the expected sequence by the grammar. Let me look for each 't' in the string and see if it's a terminal in the grammar that comes from some NT rule.\n\nFor example, the first part of the string is t55. Looking at the grammar, any NT rule that produces a 't55'? Let's see:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT91 -> t4 t33, so that's 't4 t33'. No 't55' there. NT99? Not present. Wait, the rules include:\n\nWait, I'm looking through the rules and see:\n\n- NT58 -> t33 t4,\n- NT59 -> t14 t20,\n- NT34 -> t34,\n- NT77 -> t33 t79,\n- and so on.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong approach. Maybe I should look for a full derivation tree that matches the string. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts corresponding to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm, but since the user says to think through without code, perhaps I can do it manually.\n\nAnother approach: the first character is t55. I need to find if t55 can be derived from any NT rule. Looking through the rules, no NT seems to produce t55 directly as a terminal. Because each production either leads to another NT or a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\n- NT55 is a non-terminal, and in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 -> t52,\n- NT58 -> t59 t18,\n- NT32 -> t39 t42,\n- etc.\n\nWait, yes, I find that NT35 -> t44, so 't44' comes from NT35. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each 't' in the string:\n\n1. t55: Looking for a rule where NT produces t55. Scanning the rules:\n\n- NT55 -> t52,\n- NT54 -> t16,\n- NT52 -> t49,\n- etc.\n\nWait, no rule produces t55 directly. Hmm, maybe that's a problem. If t55 isn't a terminal, then how is it generated? Unless I'm misunderstanding the rules. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping.\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NTs, but I need to find which NTs can directly produce a 't'. For example, NT77 -> t33 t79, so that's a terminal string of two terminal symbols: 't33 t79'.\n\nSimilarly, NT78 -> t28 t48, etc.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, I need to see if it can be the result of a production of the NTs.\n\nBut the first character is t55. In the rules, no NT directly produces 't55'. So that's a red flag. Maybe that means the string cannot be generated by the grammar, right? Because none of the NTs produce 't55' as a terminal.\n\nWait, but let me check all the rules again to be thorough.\n\nLooking through all the rules starting with NT:\n\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87,\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13,\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18,\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58,\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79,\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58,\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22,\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83,\n- NT51 -> NT70 NT94,\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69,\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70,\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4,\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50,\n- NT91 -> NT2 NT33,\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48,\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20,\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42,\n- NT68 -> NT54 NT28,\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87,\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40,\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83,\n- NT14 -> NT66 NT90,\n- NT13 -> NT85 NT40,\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18,\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58,\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98,\n- NT7 -> NT87 NT97,\n- NT87 -> NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-519","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I think are tokens or terminals from the grammar. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the base case where a non-terminal can expand into a single terminal. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals, C is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs, which is CNF. However, some productions like NT75 -> t60 are terminals, so those are the base cases. The string I need to evaluate is a series of these 't' tokens with numbers, which I think are the terminals.\n\nThe string is: `t60 t55 t28 t25 t52 t38 t37 t52 t27 t28 t45 t8 t37 t1 t38 t11 t56 t32 t44 t11 t29 t44 t57 t21 t56 t53 t6 t8`.\n\nI think each token represents the application of a production rule. The approach to check if the string is generated by the grammar is to see if the grammar can be derived into this sequence through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string should be generated by applying the productions step by step, ensuring each step reduces the number of symbols by one (since each application of a rule in CNF reduces the number of symbols by one).\n\nBut given the string is 30 tokens, which is quite long, manually checking each step isn't feasible. Instead, I can approach this by building a parse tree from the top symbol downwards or bottom up, but without a detailed parse table, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for sequences in the string that match the possible productions. For example, each symbol in the string is either a terminal or part of a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nFor instance, the first symbol is 't60', which in the grammar is produced by NT75 -> t60. So in the parse tree, the root must eventually expand to something that includes NT75 as a path.\n\nLooking further, the string starts with t60, which is the expansion of NT75, so in the parse tree, the root (S) would eventually produce NT75. Then, from the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So for S to produce NT75, perhaps there's a way NT88 or NT26 can derive to include NT75.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. So S is just two non-terminals, each of which would expand further.\n\nBut 't60' is the terminal at the bottom, so it must come from NT75. So in the leftmost derivation, we start with S and go left to right, substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first two symbols in the string must be the results of NT88 expanded and NT26 expanded. Let me check the string again: the first symbol is t60, which could be NT75, but NT88 is at the start. So maybe the first NT88 in S would produce t60 and another symbol, while NT26 would produce others.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t60. Since the grammar uses leftmost derivation, the first symbol would come from the leftmost non-terminal, which is NT88. So NT88 must expand to t60 plus some other symbols. Looking at the grammar, NT88 is only listed once as S's production, so we need to see if NT88 can derive t60 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the rules, is there any production for NT88 other than the one from S? Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT88 -> ... The only entry I see is in S: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Is NT88 produced by any other rule? From the full grammar provided, the last lines are mostly 't's, but the only NT88 is in S's production.\n\nSo, unless there's another production for NT88, which there isn't, that means the first symbol in the string must come from NT88's expansion. But in the grammar, how can NT88 produce t60? It doesn't have a production that directly gives t60. The first symbol is t60, which is NT75 -> t60. So unless NT88 can expand into NT75 plus something else, but I don't see that in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal can only expand into a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. So to get t60 as the first symbol, NT88 must expand into t60 and something else. But looking at the grammar, the only production for NT88 is nowhere else, only in S. So unless NT88 can somehow produce t60 directly, which it can't because it isn't listed.\n\nThis suggests that the string starts with t60, which would require NT88 to expand into t60, but since it doesn't have a production for that, the string can't be derived from S in CNF.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the question is whether the grammar generates the string, and the options are Yes or No. So if the first symbol t60 can't come from NT88, which doesn't have a production for t60, then the string isn't generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake in the order of derivations. Since S \u2192 NT88 NT26, the first step is S deriving into NT88 and NT26. Then NT88 would derive into a sequence of symbols, but since we're using leftmost derivation, we start expanding the leftmost non-terminal first. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT88.\n\nLooking again at NT88, it's only found as S \u2192 NT88 NT26, meaning NT88 doesn't have a direct production to any terminal except possibly via other steps. Maybe NT88 can expand into more non-terminals, which in turn expand into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the entire grammar provided, let me scan for any NT88 or t75 or something else. I see that NT88 is only in S's production. So in the production tree, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then each of these can expand further.\n\nSo, for example, NT88 could expand into NT32 and NT4 (from looking at the grammar, NT32 -> NT73 NT42, etc., and NT4 is used in several places), while NT26 expands into NT68 NT13, and so on.\n\nBut for the first symbol to be t60, which is from NT75, we'd need that t60 to be the first symbol. But NT88 doesn't produce t60 directly, so the string can't start with t60 if the first step is to expand NT88. Unless there's a chain where NT88 generates a sequence that includes t60 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, here's another approach: let's see how t60 appears in the grammar. Looking at the provided rules, t60 is part of NT53 -> t48, but that doesn't help. Wait, no\u2014it's actually nt53 -> t48. But I don't see t60 anywhere as a terminal. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is directly expanded into 't60'. The closest is NT75 -> t60. Wait, looking further: yes, I see NT75 -> t60. So 't60' is the expansion of NT75. But if the non-terminal NT88 doesn't have a production that directly or indirectly leads to NT75 as the first symbol, then 't60' can't appear first.\n\nWait, but let me check NT88's productions again. The only production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. There's no other rule for NT88. So, unless NT88 has some derivation steps, it can't produce any terminals on its own. So the first symbol in the string must come from NT88. Since NT88 doesn't have a production that includes a terminal, the first symbol can't be a terminal, but it is.\n\nTherefore, since t60 is a terminal derived from NT75, and the first symbol is t60, which would have to come from NT75, but the leftmost symbol in the string comes from the leftmost non-terminal (NT88).

{"custom_id":"request-539","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is `t12 t17 t12 t4 t15 t8 t2 t57 t54 t45 t8 t34 t23 t48 t26 t38 t12 t32 t1 t53 t4 t47 t49 t11 t4 t60 t53 t6 t32`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So all the productions in the grammar must be terminals or non-terminals on both sides. Looking at the grammar provided, it's mostly productions like S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then each NT has two non-terminals on the right side. Wait, no, some of them have a mix of NT and terminals. For example, NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4, where 4 is a terminal. Oh, that's a problem because in CNF, all productions should be either symbols to symbols. So, does the grammar actually conform to CNF as stated, or is there a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The user said the grammar is in CNF. So perhaps I should assume all productions are correctly in CNF, maybe the ones that have terminals on the right are allowed because the problem states it's CNF, maybe with the terminals considered. Or perhaps the grammar was provided with some terminals, but CNF can include terminals on the right side as part of the productions. Maybe I should take it as given that it's in CNF, regardless of the mix here.\n\nAnyway, moving on. The string is a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must generate this string by deriving it from the start symbol, S. The process would involve starting from S and applying productions step by step, eventually ending up with all terminals.\n\nOne approach is to construct a parse tree, ensuring that the number of steps corresponds correctly. Let me count the number of symbols in the string. The string is: t12 t17 t12 t4 t15 t8 t2 t57 t54 t45 t8 t34 t23 t48 t26 t38 t12 t32 t1 t53 t4 t47 t49 t11 t4 t60 t53 t6 t32. Let me count them: that's 33 tokens. \n\nIn a CFG in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by 1 (since we replace one non-terminal with two). Therefore, the total number of production steps needed is (n-1), where n is the number of symbols in the string. Since there are 33 symbols, the number of steps should be 32.\n\nNow, let's check the length. The start symbol S needs to produce a string of 33 terminals, which would require 32 steps, as each step adds one symbol. But let me think about the structure of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo S can only be replaced by NT88 and NT26. NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. But wait, NT13 can be replaced by NT7 and NT69, which further splits into other non-terminals and eventually some terminals.\n\nWait, let me try to see the structure of each NT and how they can produce terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' (terminal), and NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nWait, so NT8 is a terminal, and NT32 is split into NT73 and NT42. Now, NT73 \u2192 't27', and NT42 \u2192 't30'. Wait, but looking at the grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 't27', yes, so that's a terminal. NT42 \u2192 't30'. Okay, so NT42 can be 't30'. \n\nSo combining, NT88 \u2192 't29' 't32' where 't32' is NT73 and NT42. Wait, no: NT88 is NT8 (t29) and NT32. NT32 is NT73 and NT42. So NT73 is 't27', and NT42 is 't30'. So NT88 becomes 't29' 't27' 't30'?\n\nWait no, NT32 can only be split into NT73 and NT42, so NT32 is two non-terminals. So NT88 \u2192 t29 followed by NT32, which would then be further split into its components. Hmm, but each step only splits one non-terminal into two.\n\nLet me consider that starting from S, each production replaces one non-terminal with two. So the initial step would generate two non-terminals. Then each of those would generate two, but depending on how many steps you take.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by looking for the specific string and seeing if it can be broken down into the given grammar.\n\nLet me break down the target string step by step.\n\nThe string is: \n\nt12 t17 t12 t4 t15 t8 t2 t57 t54 t45 t8 t34 t23 t48 t26 t38 t12 t32 t1 t53 t4 t47 t49 t11 t4 t60 t53 t6 t32.\n\nThat's 33 tokens, which as I said requires 32 steps. Let me see if each step in the string can be built using the given productions.\n\nBut maybe an alternative approach is more practical. Let's see what each of the non-terminals in the grammar can produce in terms of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, to get the string, we start with S and split into NT88 and NT26.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. NT8 is 't29' and NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. NT73 is 't27', NT42 is 't30'.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t17, t12, etc., which don't directly match these. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at all the non-terminals and see what their possible terminal sequences are.\n\nLet me go through each NT and see the paths they can take.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29'.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nNT73 \u2192 't27', NT42 \u2192 't30'.\n\nSo from S, via NT88, we get t29 't27' 't30' on the right side because NT32 splits into t27 and t30. Wait, but that's only three symbols: t29 t27 t30.\n\nBut then NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 \u2192 't16' (terminal).\n\nNT28 \u2192 't56' (terminal).\n\nSo NT68 is NT54 t56, which are both terminals, so NT68 \u2192 t16 t56.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58.\n\nNT59 \u2192 't48'.\n\nNT58 \u2192 't28' (terminal).\n\nSo NT7 \u2192 t48 t28.\n\nThen, NT58 is 't28'.\n\nSo NT13 \u2192 (NT59 NT58) but wait, NT13's production is NT7 and NT69.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at NT13:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't48' 't28'.\n\nNT69 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSo NT13 \u2192 t48 t28 t27.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69, which is t48, t28, t27.\n\nSo from NT68 and NT13, we get t16 t56 t48 t28 t27.\n\nPutting it all together, S \u2192 t29 t27 t30 t16 t56 t48 t28 t27.\n\nWait, but that's just the expansion from S, giving eight terminals, but the string is much longer.\n\nHmm, this seems"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-559","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. Each production is a single step in the derivation.\n\nThe starting symbol here is S, and the string to check is `t27 t28 t25 t17 t27 t49 t45 t29 t29 t30 t57 t4 t27 t9 t23 t60 t6 t52 t6 t12 t32 t56 t56 t44 t34 t1 t2 t28 t9 t4`.\n\nI notice that in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal when they reach the base case, like NT17 -> 't29', NT2 -> 't36', etc. So, the string is made up of these terminal symbols.\n\nI need to check if the given string can be derived from S by applying the productions step by step. Since the string has multiple terminals, I'll have to see if the grammar allows for splitting the string into parts that each match the productions.\n\nLet's break down the string into its components:\n\nt27, t28, t25, t17, t27, t49, t45, t29, t29, t30, t57, t4, t27, t9, t23, t60, t6, t52, t6, t12, t32, t56, t56, t44, t34, t1, t2, t28, t9, t4.\n\nI think the approach would be to work backward from the string, trying to find possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals when expanded.\n\nLooking at the string, the first element is t27. I see that NT7 -> t27, or NT73 -> t27. Wait, in the grammar, NT73 -> 't27' is a direct production, right? So NT73 can produce t27.\n\nBut looking at the grammar rules, NT73 is defined as NT75 NT83. So, in the derivation, if we have NT73, we can split it into NT75 and NT83, which can then be further derived until we hit the terminals.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with t28, which is produced by NT28. But looking back, in the grammar, NT28 is directly 't28', and the production for NT28 is NT28 -> t28.\n\nWait, no. Let me check. In the grammar, NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and elsewhere, I see NT28 -> t28? Or is that a typo. Wait, looking at the user message, the grammar includes:\n\nNT28 -> t56\n\nWait, actually, let me confirm:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\nNT28 -> t56\n\nAnd for NT40, it's NT40 -> t6.\n\nHmm, but in the string, the first few tokens are t27, t28, t25, t17, etc. So, perhaps the derivation starts with S, and each step applies a production.\n\nBut this might get complicated because the string is quite long. Maybe I can try to parse from the end or look for a possible parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree starting from the beginning. Let's see.\n\nThe first symbol is t27. From the grammar, possible ways to get t27:\n\nNT73 -> 't27', so t27 comes from NT73.\n\nSo, the first part of the derivation is S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t27, so how is that connected?\n\nWait no, I'm getting confused. Let me step back.\n\nWait, S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, to generate the string, the first terminal must come from either NT88 or NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t27. Let's see if t27 can come from either NT88 or NT26.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT88 produces 't27'. So NT88 can derive t27.\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13. Wait, so NT26 requires two non-terminals: NT68 and NT13. But in the string, the first symbol is t27, which could only come from NT88 or NT26.\n\nWait, if the first symbol is t27, and S produces NT88 NT26, then the string must be a concatenation of the expansions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nBut t27 could come from NT88, which is a terminal, or from NT26, which requires two non-terminals.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t27, it could come from NT88, and the next symbols must come from the expansion of NT26, which is NT68 NT13.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the first symbol t27 comes from NT88, and the rest is generated by NT26.\n\nWait, the string is a series of t's and numbers; each is a terminal symbol. So, the entire string must be a direct derivation starting from S and expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try parsing the string as a leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to check if each consecutive pair of symbols can be mapped to a production.\n\nWait, but each step in the production is two non-terminals. So, perhaps it's better to consider the entire string as a series of productions.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to work from the start.\n\nS generates NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the first symbol must come from NT88 or NT26.\n\nSince the first symbol is t27, let's see which NT can produce t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT73 -> 't27' (direct production).\n\nAlso, NT7 -> 't2' and others.\n\nWait, the grammar also has NT73 -> NT75 NT83.\n\nSo, to produce t27, it's possible that NT73 is expanded, but that's more steps. Alternatively, if the first part is NT88, which produces t27, that's a direct match.\n\nSo, first symbol t27 can come from NT88.\n\nThus, S -> NT88 t27.\n\nNow, the rest of the string is after t27.\n\nBut wait, S is NT88 NT26, so if we derive t27 from NT88, then NT26 must expand into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, S generates NT88 and NT26. So the string must be a concatenation of the derivations of NT88 and NT26.\n\nSince t27 is the first symbol, that comes from NT88. Then the rest of the string must come from NT26.\n\nSo, now, let's focus on NT26. According to the grammar, NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, NT26 expands into two non-terminals: NT68 and NT13. So the next symbols must come from the expansion of NT68 and NT13.\n\nBut wait, the second symbol in the string is t28. So, the string after t27 is t28 t25 t17 t27... So, perhaps the expansion of NT68 and NT13 must derive t28 and the rest.\n\nWait, maybe I need to break it down further.\n\nWait, the initial step is S -> NT88 NT26, which produces the first symbol as t27, then the rest must be from NT26's expansion, which is NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, after t27, we have t28, t25, t17, t27, etc. So, these symbols are coming from NT68 and NT13.\n\nSo, the NT26 expansion is NT68 NT13.\n\nThus, the next symbols would be the result of expanding NT68 and NT13.\n\nLet's see what NT68 and NT13 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> t56 (direct production).\n\nSo, NT68 can produce t56, which would be the next symbol after t27. But in the string, after t27 comes t28, not t56.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if NT68 produces t56, but the string has t28 next, that suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe the string is generated by NT88 followed by NT26, and the entire string is the result of expanding that.\n\nSo, S -> NT88 NT26."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-553","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, but I'll need to figure out a way to approach this without having to perform an exhaustive parse, which could be really time-consuming.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), I know that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies certain parsing methods, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, S starts with NT88 NT26. So the first step in any derivation from S should produce two symbols: NT88 and NT26. The string starts with t26, which is a terminal. From the grammar, I see that NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So NT26 can be expanded, but when it does, it produces two non-terminals: NT68 and NT13.\n\nIn the string, after the initial t26, we have t11, t19, t12, etc. Let me check if t11 is among the terminals produced by NT68 and NT13.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nFor NT13, I see that in the grammar, NT13 has multiple productions. One of them is NT13 -> NT85 FT40. Another is NT13 -> NT85 RT40 (or perhaps the same). Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT13 has several productions, like NT13 -> NT7 FT69, NT13 -> NT72 etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar as provided, I see that NT13 has a production NT13 -> NT58 NT83, and also NT13 -> NT58 NT40. Oh, wait, no, checking:\n\nWait, the grammar looks like a lot of entries. Let me scan for NT13's productions.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, I spot:\n\nNT13 -> NT7 NT69,\n\nNT13 -> NT58 NT83,\n\nNT13 -> NT14 NT85,\n\nand also a line says NT14 -> NT66 NT90, which isn't relevant here. Also, a line says NT13 -> NT53 NT33, which might not be relevant.\n\nSo, from NT13, the possible expansions include NT7 NT69, NT58 NT83, and other combinations but maybe not relevant now.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. NT26 expands to NT68 NT13. Now, the string starts with t26, but that's after NT26, right? So the string is t26 t11..., which suggests that after NT26, which is the first part, it's expanding into something that leads to t11 as the second symbol.\n\nWait, but NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So when you expand S, you get NT88 and NT26, so the initial symbols are NT88 and NT26. Then, each of these can be expanded further.\n\nSo, after S, the first symbols are NT88 and NT26. NT88 can expand into NT41 and NT58. NT26 expands into NT68 and NT13.\n\nNow, in the string, the first symbol is t26. Wait, but NT26 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. So in the string, the first symbol is t26, which suggests that the expansion of NT26 must produce a terminal t26. So we need to see if in the grammar, NT26 can produce t26 directly.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT26:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Hmm, that's a non-terminal expansion. But also, looking through the other productions, I don't immediately see ND26 -> t26.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nI don't immediately see NT26 -> t26. Wait, let me check all the rules where NT26 is in the left-hand side. The rules are:\n\n1. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nWait, that's it. There are lines like NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70, which is for NT2, but I don't see NT26 generating a terminal directly. Hmmm, so maybe NT26 can expand into two non-terminals, and further expansions are needed until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the string begins with t26, so that would require that either NT26 directly produces t26, which it doesn't seem to. Oh wait, perhaps I missed a production where NT26 can expand to t26. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the list, I only see NT26's production as NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So, unless one of these further expansions leads to a terminal t26, the initial NS symbol (S) would have to expand in a way that leads to the string starting with t26.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me look at the string again. It's: `t26 t11 t19 t12 t44 t20 t37 t45 t44 t48 t15 t49 t39 t53 t25 t18 t60 t19 t34 t32 t34 t53 t54 t8 t12 t29 t37 t57 t4 t9`.\n\nSo the very first symbol is t26, which is a terminal. That suggests that in the derivation, the first expansion is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and then somehow NT88 and NT26 undergo further expansions to produce t26 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but NT26 is a non-terminal. So NT26 must expand into something that can start with t26. Wait, perhaps I've misread the grammar. Let me double-check the grammar rules.\n\nLooking again, the NT26 production:\n\nAh, yes, I just saw it now. One of the lines is: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, and that's it. Hmm, but nowhere does NT26 directly produce a terminal like t26.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong, maybe I misread. Let me see.\n\nNo, I think I'm correct now. NT26 only expands to NT68 NT13. So the first step from S gives us NT88 NT26. Now, in order to get t26 as the first symbol, one of these non-terminals, perhaps NT26, must expand into a terminal. But it doesn't look like that's the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the rule incorrectly. Let me check all the NT26 expansions again. Looking through the provided lines:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nIs that the only one? Yes, I think so. So if S starts as NT88 NT26, then to get a terminal as the first symbol, maybe NT88 or NT26 can produce a terminal. But in this case, NT26 cannot, it only produces two non-terminals, so then NT88 would have to be expanded first.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 (from NT88's production) let's see, where does NT88 go?\n\nLooking for NT88 in the production rules:\n\nLooking through the lines, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nSo NT88 expands to NT8 and NT32.\n\nSo now, the string begins with NT88 and NT26. After expanding S, we have NT88 and NT26. Expanding NT88, we get NT8 and NT32, so the current string is now NT8, NT32, NT26.\n\nBut the actual string starts with t26, a terminal, so perhaps this isn't the right path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. The string is to be checked from left to right, generating it step by step. So, the first step is to have S produce NT88 and NT26. Then, NT88 can be expanded to NT8 and NT32. None of these directly produce t26, so perhaps this path doesn't produce t26 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, that's confusing because the first symbol in the string is t26, which is a terminal, but according to the grammar, the initial symbols are S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which are non-terminals. So perhaps this grammar doesn't allow the first symbol to be a terminal, which would make the string invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the production rules.

{"custom_id":"request-578","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me see. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That structure might make parsing the string a bit easier.\n\nFirst, I should look at the string and see if it's a series of terminal symbols. The string is: `t4 t15 t15 t30 t26 t53 t12 t54 t4 t8 t18 t6 t55 t33 t60 t15 t39 t30 t23 t29 t6 t27 t20 t60 t6 t49 t21 t26 t26 t6 t44`.\n\nAll elements are 't' followed by numbers, so they're terminals. The grammar's start symbol is S, and the initial production is S -> NT88 NT26. So, the string must be a sequence that can be derived from these NT rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT production expands into two NT symbols until we reach terminals. So, I should try to split the string into parts that match these productions.\n\nLet me start by breaking the string into chunks. The initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the string should be divided into two parts corresponding to NT88 and NT26. Let's see:\n\nFirst part: t4 t15 t15 t30 t26 t53 t12 t54 t4 t8 t18 t6 t55 t33 t60 t15 t39 t30 t23 t29 t6 t27 t20 t60 t6 t49 t21 t26 t26 t6 t44\nSecond part (if applicable) should match NT26. Wait, but the initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so after generating from S, there are two parts. However, the string provided is a single sequence, so if S is followed by NT88 and NT26, then the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, actually, that's not correct. Because the initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, each of these NT symbols needs to derive a string. So, the entire string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT88 and NT26. So the given string should be split into two parts: the first part comes from NT88, the second from NT26.\n\nLet me check: the string starts with t4, which is the production for NT72 \u2192 t27. Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Maybe I should look for each NT's production.\n\nWait, the grammar includes each NT's productions. For example, looking at NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So, if I start with NT88, it produces NT8 and NT32. Then each of these will split further until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to map the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a sequence of t4, t15, etc. So, let's see if the entire string can be built by expanding NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, but the initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string should be the result of NT88's expansion followed by NT26's expansion. So, I need to split the given string into two parts where the first part is NT88's expansion and the second is NT26's expansion.\n\nBut in the given string, the total length is 36 tokens. Since NT88 and NT26 each produce a certain number of tokens, maybe I can check if 36 is the sum of their expansions.\n\nBut wait, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Let me look at NT8's productions. NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT16. Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT16\n- NT54 \u2192 NT16 NT13\n- NT16 \u2192 NT72 NT66\n- NT72 \u2192 t27\n- NT66 \u2192 t30\n\nWait, so following this path:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 \u2192 NT54 NT16 NT32 \u2192 NT16 NT13 NT16 NT32 \u2192 NT72 NT66 NT13 NT16 NT32 \u2192 NT27 t30 NT13 NT16 NT32\n\nThis seems like it's going to generate a string starting with t27 followed by t30, then more steps. Let me stop here for a moment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split isn't the right approach. Perhaps the better approach is to try to parse the entire string, ensuring that all expansions of the non-terminals correctly produce the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards, processing the string from the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the string can be represented as a tree where each non-terminal expansion corresponds to parts of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should start by looking at each token in the string and see if they match any NT productions. But that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar has certain parts that produce specific terminal sequences. For example, looking for which NTs produce t4. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\nNT8 \u2192 NT54 NT16\nNT54 \u2192 NT16 NT13\nNT16 \u2192 NT72 NT66\nNT72 \u2192 t27\nNT66 \u2192 t30\n\nSo, NT88's expansion would eventually produce t27 t30 ... but the string starts with t4.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the string starts with t4, which is part of NT59 \u2192 t60. Or perhaps another NT.\n\nWait, let me check the productions for each NT that directly produce terminals:\n\nLooking at all the NTs, some have productions that result in t.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t25\n- NT48 \u2192 t27\n- NT7 \u2192 t2 or t58\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nNo, looking at each NT in the productions:\n\nLooking for NTs where a production is directly a terminal (like nt -> tX).\n\nWait, wait, no, the grammar is written with NTs on the left, and on the right, combinations of other NTs or terminals (tX). So, the NT productions are either to two NTs or to a terminal.\n\nSo, NTs that have a production that produces a terminal, e.g., NT32 \u2192 t25 (Wait no, looking: Looking at NT28 \u2192 t56, but not NT25.

{"custom_id":"request-575","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar provided is a bit extensive, but I'll try to parse through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) has productions that break it down into two other non-terminals. This is typical for Chomsky Normal Form, where each production is either two terminals or two non-terminals. When I see a production ending with 't', that's a terminal symbol, probably letters or digits representing terminal characters, whereas NTs are non-terminals.\n\nThe target string to evaluate is: `t33 t52 t15 t55 t26 t49 t17 t55 t30 t30 t26 t38 t37 t32 t56 t23 t57 t33 t16 t54 t55 t38 t11 t52 t53 t53 t37 t34 t29 t2 t8`.\n\nHmm, that's quite a long string, 38 tokens. I need to check if this string can be generated by the given grammar. Each 't' followed by numbers is a terminal symbol, which I assume are the characters in the string. The NTs are non-terminals that can be replaced by other symbols.\n\nLet me approach this by seeing if I can trace the derivation of the string from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26 according to the first rule: S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the initial derivation splits into NT88 and NT26, and each of these will produce sequences of symbols. Since the string starts with t33, I'll need to look for productions that can lead to sequences starting with t33.\n\nLooking at the NTs, I'll check which NTs can produce t33 as a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT33. Let's see where NT33 is defined. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT33 defined as producing a terminal. Instead, NT33 has a production to NT59 and NT18. So, it's a non-terminal and can't produce a terminal right away.\n\nWait, no, I see that NT59 is replaced by NT14 and NT20, as per the rule NT59 -> NT14 NT20. Then, looking at NT20, it has a production to NT51 and NT72. Wait, maybe I should look for NTs that can derive a 't33' somewhere.\n\nLet me check each occurrence of a 't33' in the string. The first 't33' is at position 9, and it's part of the string. Let me see where each 't' might come from.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be generated. Alternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the length of the string can help. In CNF, each production is two symbols (either two NTs or a terminal and NT, maybe). Wait, actually, each production is two symbols, so starting from S, each step increases the number of symbols by one, because each NT is replaced by two symbols. So the derivation length would be 2^n -1, but in this case, the string is 38 symbols long.\n\nWait, let me check. The initial symbol S is one non-terminal. Each production splits a non-terminal into two, so the number of symbols increases by one each time. For example:\n\nS (1) -> NT88 NT26 (2)\nThen each of those NTs would eventually split, so after k steps, the number of symbols is 2^k.\n\nWait, no. Each production adds one symbol. So if you have a string of length L, the number of steps is L-1. But in CNF, each step replaces one symbol with two, so starting from S, each step increases the count by one. So, for a string of length n, you need n-1 steps, because you start with 1 symbol and each step adds 1.\n\nBut wait, the string is 38 symbols, which implies 37 steps. So the derivation should expand S through 37 steps to produce 38 symbols. That's a lot, but manageable.\n\nHmm, but how to track it down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use memoization or a recursive descent approach to parse the string, but manually that would be error-prone. Instead, perhaps I can look for the possible ways each 't' could be generated.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, each NT has rules that eventually end up producing t's or other NTs. So for example, NT58 can produce either two t's or two NTs, but the given rules have some t's.\n\nWait, let me look at the NT58 rule: NT58 -> NT33 NT4. NT4 then goes to NT20 NT22, and NT20 is NT51 NT72, etc. Hmm, it seems that some NTs can derive into sequences of t's, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string uses several NTs that eventually derive into the required t's.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar. For example, each 't' must be the result of a production that has a terminal on the right-hand side. So for each 't', we can check if it can be generated by some NT.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT58 can become NT33 NT4, and then eventually some NTs that might derive into t's. Alternatively, NT22 can go to NT44 NT44, etc. But the string has multiple t's, so I need to see if each can be generated.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps using the CYK algorithm. The string is quite long, so that would help, but I don't remember all the steps. Alternatively, maybe some of the t's can only be generated by specific NTs.\n\nWait, for example, let's take the first 't33'. Looking at the grammar, which NTs can produce 't33'? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't33' except NT59, because NT59 -> NT14 NT20, and then looking further down, NT20 -> NT51 NT72, which seems like it goes further into non-terminals. Alternatively, NT33 -> NT59 NT18, and then NT59 is broken down.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I can find the parse tree step by step. Starting with S:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nSo, the first two symbols must be generated by NT88 and NT26. Let's see what NT88 produces: NT88-> NT8 NT32. Then NT8 is NT29, and NT32 is NT25, and so on. Wait, maybe that's not the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find which NTs can produce the sequences of 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t33. Let's see if any NT can derive t33... From the rules, I see that NT33 is defined as NT59 NT18. So, to get t33, that's not possible directly. Instead, perhaps a longer derivation.\n\nWait, maybe it's too time-consuming to go through all possibilities. Perhaps an alternative approach is to count the number of t's and NT's to see if it's a possible derivation.\n\nAnother approach: The start symbol is S, and each production in CNF increases the number of symbols. Since the string has 38 symbols and S is the start, perhaps the string is too long to be generated, but that's not necessarily true. For example, S-> A B, then A could produce a lot, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if each 't' in the string can be reached through the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, let's look at the end of the string. The last 't' is 't8'. In the grammar, NT8 is NT29, and looking further, NT29's rule is NT17 NT26. Wait, but I don't see where t8 comes from.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the production rules, I see that NT88 -> NT8 NT32. And NT8 -> NT29, and NT29 is NT17 NT26, etc. Then in the end, do any of these lead to 't8'? Or does 't8' come from somewhere else?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT17 has a production to NT63 NT50, and NT63->NT48 NT87, etc. Maybe 't8' comes from a production that eventually leads to a terminal. Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT71->NT2 NT33, NT2 -> 't36'.

{"custom_id":"request-599","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens like `t32`, `t57`, etc. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. Importantly, the start symbol shouldn't lead directly to a terminal, but in this case, it seems like the start symbol S can generate terminals because some rules have terminals as results, like S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and NT88 \u2192 NT88 -> ... eventually leading to a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the production rules for S, NT63, etc., some might produce a terminal directly, especially those with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT88 \u2192 NT88 is a recursive production, but perhaps there's a base case. Wait, looking at the rules, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, and some of these eventually lead to terminals. Like NT50 \u2192 't53' which is a terminal.\n\nSo the grammar allows for terminal symbols, and each production is either two terminals or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and I need to see if the string can be derived starting from S.\n\nThe given string is: `t32 t57 t8 t9 t15 t34 t49 t28 t36 t38 t16 t53 t15 t44 t9 t52 t20 t15 t37 t29 t6 t9 t53 t38 t38 t9 t27 t8 t30 t23 t33 t20`.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, all starting with 't' followed by a number. So each token in the string is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should have nodes that are either leaf nodes (terminals) or internal nodes with exactly two children. Each production is left- or right-side, so the order of the productions matters.\n\nStarting from S, which is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the root of the parse tree would be S with two children: NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step, trying to construct the parse tree.\n\n1. The first symbol is `t32`. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT40 \u2192 't6' and NT18 \u2192 't47', etc. Wait, but in the string, the first token is `t32`. Checking the production rules, is there any non-terminal that directly produces `t32`? Let me scan the rules. Oh yes, there's NT48 \u2192 't27' and another NT48 \u2192 't2' somewhere? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 and NT48 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 't2' seems not directly. Wait, perhaps I should list all the terminals to see if any NT rules produce `t32`.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the grammar, tokens like 't32', 't57', 't8', etc. So, are there any NT rules where either side becomes `t32`? Looking through the rules:\n\nYes, I see NT75 \u2192 't60' and NT55 \u2192 't54', etc., but where does `t32` come from? Checking the rules, NT32 \u2192 't1', and also NT58 \u2192 't33', NT28 \u2192 't56', NT48 \u2192 't27', and others. Hmm, perhaps another NT rule. Wait, looking at the rules, I think NT23 \u2192 't33' and NT24 \u2192 't30'. So perhaps `t32` comes from NT56 \u2192 't32'? Wait, let me check the rules. Looking for NT... \u2192 `t32`. I see NT32 \u2192 't1', so that doesn't produce `t32`. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the rules have NT48 \u2192 't2' and 't27' as part of some NT88 production. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to parse it by finding possible derivations.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 and NT26 are non-terminals, so each should produce a string of terminals. Let's see what each of these non-terminals can derive.\n\nFor NT88: Looking at the rules, NT88 seems to be a recursive case: NT88 \u2192 NT88. That might be problematic because it could lead to an infinite loop unless it's reduced to something else. Wait, looking at the production rules, I see NT88 \u2192 NT88. But perhaps there's a way for it to terminate. Let me check all NT88's productions.\n\nWait, looking back, the production for NT88 isn't directly present except in the rules for other NTs. Let me go through the rules again:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n- NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n- NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n- NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\n- NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50\n- NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33\n- NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48\n- NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n- NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\n- NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40\n- NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83\n- NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90\n- NT13 \u2192 NT85 NT40\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n- NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58\n- NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT98\n- NT7 \u2192 NT87 NT97\n- NT87 \u2192 NT76 NT35\n- NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT86 NT4\n- NT13 \u2192 NT53 NT33\n- NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18\n- NT73 \u2192 't27'\n- NT50 \u2192 't53'\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't18'\n- NT11 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't29'\n- NT55 \u2192 't8'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT90 \u2192 't56'\n- NT75 \u2192 't60'\n- NT55 \u2192 't52'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT17 \u2192 't19'\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\n- NT11 \u2192 't30'\n- NT66 \u2192 't30'\n- NT55 \u2192 't54'\n- NT8 \u2192 't54'\n- NT72 \u2192 't33'\n- NT12 \u2192 't17'\n- NT8 \u2192 't6'\n- NT97 \u2192 't4'\n- NT94 \u2192 't57'\n- NT51 \u2192 't39'\n- NT2 \u2192 't36'\n- NT91 \u2192 't44'\n- NT18 \u2192 't26'\n- NT12 \u2192 't23'\n- NT72 \u2192 't23'\n- NT94 \u2192 't23'\n- NT54 \u2192 't16'\n- NT13 \u2192 't12'\n- NT59 \u2192 't15'\n- NT72 \u2192 't38'\n- NT58 \u2192 't28'\n- NT98 \u2192 't45'\n- NT88 \u2192 't32'\n- NT86 \u2192 't9'\n- NT83 \u2192 't52'\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT28"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-593","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let me understand CNF. CNF requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit this because all productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is: t56 t28 t12 t52 t26 t18 t57 t30 t19 t23 t1 t33 t18 t57 t4 t52 t33 t52 t16 t17 t16 t17 t16 t15 t12 t1 t19 t26 t15 t56 t52 t27.\n\nI need to see if each 't' can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar has terminal symbols like 't27', 't56', etc., each 'tX' must be produced by a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of them have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, NT7 -> 't27', which means t27 is produced by NT7. Similarly, NT79 -> NT22 NT48, which suggests that t79 is part of a longer derivation.\n\nBut the string starts with t56 t28. So, I need to see if t56 and t28 can be produced by the grammar. Looking through the rules, I find NT58 -> t33 t4, NT75 -> t60, but I don't see any rule where a terminal like t56 is the only symbol. Hmm, wait, looking again, I see NT98 -> t41 t40, but not t56. Let me check all the rules carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see some 't' symbols as results of productions. For example, NT73 -> 't27', NT48 -> 't27' because of NT48 -> NT2 NT18, which in turn might produce 't27'. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I see multiple 't's like t56, t28, etc., and some non-terminals that produce these.\n\nLet me list the rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT70 -> 't11'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT72 -> 't44'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT41 -> 't49'\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT91 -> 't44'\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n- NT11 -> 't4'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT32 -> 't73' (Wait, no, the rule is NT73 -> 't27') Hmm, no, 't27' is from NT73.\n\nLooking through the rules, some terminals appear only as results of specific non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- NT70 -> 't11'\n- NT58 -> 't11' (Wait, no, NT58 -> t11? Let me check. Oh, the rule is NT58 -> NT69 NT18, which can produce t11 and t18. But looking at the given rules, I don't see a rule where NT58 produces 't58' as a terminal? Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The rules provided are a bit messy. Let me see if any rule produces a 't' symbol directly. For example, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- NT58 -> 't69'?\nWait, no, looking at the rules, it's NT58 -> NT33 NT4. So that's two non-terminals. So no terminal 't58' is directly produced. Hmm, I'm looking for any rule where a non-terminal is directly replaced by a 'tX' symbol.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT17 -> 't29'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT72 -> 't33'\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n- NT55 -> 't14' (Wait, no, the rule is NT55 -> 't54' from some other rule?)\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me go through each rule to see if any production results in a single 'tX' symbol.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48, so that's two non-terminals.\n- NT90 -> NT91 NT68\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40\n- NT14 -> NT66 NT90\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83, etc.\n\nWait, looking at NT58: it's defined as NT58 -> t69 t18, so that's two terms, but I see elsewhere that NT58 is also defined as NT33 NT4 (from earlier lines like NT58 -> NT33 NT4). Wait, no, the rules provided have multiple entries for some non-terminals. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find all the non-terminals that directly produce 'tX' symbols. For example, in the rules, is there any production where a non-terminal produces a single 'tX'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT70 -> 't11'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT72 -> 't44'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n\nSo, for example, NT7 produces 't2', NT70 produces 't11', etc.\n\nTherefore, to have a 'tX' in the string, that X must be either 2, 11, 44, 48, etc. But looking at the given string, the first token is t56. So, is there any non-terminal NT that can produce 't56'?\n\nI don't see any production in the given rules where a non-terminal directly produces 't56'. The only terminal symbols are specific to certain non-terminals, like t27, t6, etc. Therefore, to produce t56, we would need a production like NT56 -> 't56', but I don't see any such rule.\n\nWait, unless I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again carefully. I see:\n\nLooking for any 't56' in the right-hand sides. Let's see:\n\n- NT58 -> 't69' (from somewhere, but no, NT58 has rules like NT58-> NT33 NT4, but elsewhere, I see NT58 -> 't33' t4?) Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, the rules are listed as sequences, but I need to parse them correctly. For example, the line \"NT58 -> 't33' 't4'?\" No, no, it's likely that each line has one production, so each line shows the left-hand side and its possible right-hand sides.\n\nSo going line by line:\n\nNT73 -> 't27'\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4 (from NT58 -> NT33 NT4)\nNT58 -> 't69' (Wait, no, looking at the rules: Let me parse each line as a production rule.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, each line represents a production of the form A -> B C, where B and C are either non-terminals or terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, every rule either replaces a symbol with two others or with a terminal.\n\nThe string in question is: `t30 t47 t20 t45 t8 t11 t19 t21 t2 t29 t23 t26 t1 t18 t44 t33 t1 t55 t47 t37 t44 t21 t37 t55 t9 t45 t55 t27 t16 t32 t55 t2 t21`.\n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. Each 't' followed by a number is likely a terminal symbol. The non-terminals are those without the 't' prefix, like NT13, S, NT63, etc.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar to see how the non-terminals can produce these terminals. The goal is to see if the string can be generated starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the first symbol in the string: 't30'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't30'.\n\nFrom the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT12 -> t17 and t17 can produce 't4', but wait, 't30' isn't directly there. Let me check each rule:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT12 -> t17 and t17 is another non-terminal, but t17's rules are:\n\nNT17 -> t4 or various other non-terminals. Wait, no, let's check the rules for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking for 't30', it appears in the productions of:\n\nNT20 -> t20 (a terminal, so that's direct), but the first symbol is 't30'.\n\nChecking the rules for NT66: Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT66 directly, but let's see if any rule can produce 't30'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each symbol in the string is either a non-terminal (NTxx) or a terminal (txx). So I need to see how the string can be generated as a series of these symbols using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t30 t47 t20 t45 t8 t11 t19 t21 t2 t29 t23 t26 t1 t18 t44 t33 t1 t55 t47 t37 t44 t21 t37 t55 t9 t45 t55 t27 t16 t32 t55 t2 t21.\n\nI think a top-down approach would be better, starting from S and trying to derive the string. But maybe a bottom-up approach is easier, since each step is substitution.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string can be matched according to the grammar rules, perhaps by working backward.\n\nLet's start from the beginning.\n\nFirst token: t30.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t30? Checking all production rules for each non-terminal:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT20 -> t20, so t20 is a terminal, but t30 isn't directly produced by any rule yet. Wait, let me check all the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals are on the left, and their right-hand sides include these t's. So, for example:\n\nNT12 -> t17\n\nNT17 -> t4 or other non-terminals, but not t29. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for t30, I see:\n\nNT11 -> t17, because looking through the rules, NT11 has a production like NT11 -> t17. Or wait, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, I think I need to list all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals in the grammar and their production rules. That might help.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals are:\n\nS\nNT63\nNT26\nNT41\nNT85\nNT77\nNT7\nNT4\nNT73\nNT51\nNT13\nNT2\nNT58\nNT17\nNT91\nNT79\nNT59\nNT32\nNT68\nNT17 (again, that's a typo perhaps, but seems separate rules)\nNT98\nNT13 (multiple rules)\nNT48\nNT70\nNT73\nNT42\nNT90\nNT75\nNT53\nNT20\nNT18\nNT70\nNT88\nNT73 again\nNT53\nNT28\nNT17 multiple rules...\nI'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to see what each non-terminal can derive.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to build a parse tree.\n\nLet's see the first token is t30.\n\nLooking for which non-terminal produces t30.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT40 is on the left in several rules, but not producing t30. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for t30 in the productions: it seems NT13 produces t7 and other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT11 has a production to 't17'. But 't30' is not directly a terminal, so perhaps it should be part of a non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the grammar is a left-hand side, so non-terminals can be replaced by two non-terminals or by a terminal.\n\nSo, for the string token 't30', we can have it as a terminal, so the corresponding non-terminal must have a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, which have a production including 't30'? Let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking at each production rule, the right-hand side can be two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT13 -> NT7 and NT69 (from first rule) or NT58 and NT40, etc.\n\nLooking for any 't30' in the right-hand sides: Let me check each rule.\n\nLooking for any production where one side is a terminal 't30'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT75 -> t60.\n- NT53 -> t48.\n- NT72 -> t33?\nWait, let me check all the rules.\n\nWait, in the rules, it says some non-terminals like NT28 -> t56. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't' followed by numbers, like 't2', 't4', etc.\n\nLooking for 't30', perhaps it's a non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, I'm noticing that in the rules, several production rules end with a terminal. For example, S->NT88 NT26, which are two non-terminals. But in other cases, rules like NT7->NT11 NT22 or NT7->NT22 NT70 are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, the non-terminals can generate other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nSo, for each production, the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, to find which non-terminal can generate t30, I need to look for rules where one of the RHS is t30. Wait, no. Because 't30' is a terminal, there must be a production where a non-terminal can produce t30 as its only terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, do any of the productions have a single terminal that is t30? Let's check.\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- NT53: production includes t48, t18.\n\n- NT72: t33.\n\nWait, in the rule list, I don't see any production that ends with 't30'. For example, NT28 is shown as 't56', so that's a terminal. But 't30' is not a terminal in any production. It must be that 't30' is produced by a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but how? Because the grammar's right-hand side for non-terminals are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So if 't30' is a terminal, and the string starts with 't30', then there must be a production rule that allows the start symbol S to produce 't30', but looking at S's rule, it's NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo both NT88 and NT26 must produce something that can lead to 't30'.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each 't' token is the result"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. My goal is to figure out if this string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. Context-free grammars consist of a start symbol and production rules that rewrite non-terminal symbols into strings of non-terminals and terminals. Since this grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule either has two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. That simplifies things because it means each production expands exactly two symbols, either further symbols or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most non-terminals (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) expand into pairs of non-terminals. The terminals are represented by identifiers like t1, t2, ..., t98, and sometimes more familiar symbols like 't27' which was used in the production NT73. So the string to evaluate consists of a series of these terminal symbols.\n\nThe string in question is: `t9 t28 t45 t28 t11 t27 t55 t34 t2 t38 t29 t49 t6 t48 t18 t53 t1 t27 t52 t44 t23 t49 t38 t32 t2 t9 t21 t34 t2 t60 t4 t53 t28`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I can try to parse the string from the start symbol, using the production rules to transform the string step by step, seeing if I can reduce it to the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is large and complex, manually doing this step-by-step might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or look for specific production rules that might help.\n\nOne approach is to look for known production rules in the grammar. For example, looking at NT53, it has a production rule to 't48', but in the string, 't48' occurs, which is a terminal, so perhaps it's derived from a non-terminal that expands to that.\n\nWait, but in the productions, many non-terminals have two non-terminals as their right-hand side. So each step of the parse would reduce these pairs into potentially one symbol, depending on whether one of the non-terminals can expand to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map terminals to their origin non-terminals. For example, finding if a terminal occurs in the grammar as a production. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for t9: I see in NT66 -> t30 and NT58->t11, etc. Hmm. Let me look through all the rules for terminals:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' (No)\n- NT70 -> 't11' (Yes)\n- NT73 -> 't27' (Yes)\n- NT50 -> 't38' (Yes, but t50 is not present in the string)\n- NT72 -> 't23' (Yes, but t23 isn't in the string)\n- NT75 -> 't60' (Yes, but t60 is in the string)\n- NT2 -> 't36' (No)\n- NT91 -> 't44' (Yes)\n- NT94 -> 't57' (No)\n- NT51 -> 't39' (No)\n- NT28 -> 't25', 't25' isn't in the string, but looking at NT48 -> 't27' (Yes, in the string as the fifth word is 't27')\n- NT18 -> t47 (No)\n- NT40 -> 't6' (Yes, t6 is in the string later)\n- NT20 -> 't51' (No)\n- NT90 -> 't56' (No)\n- NT75 -> 't60' (Yes, t60 is in the string)\n- NT58 -> 't11', but I think in one of the rules: NT58 -> t11 and t18? Wait, looking back: NT58 -> NT33 NT4, but then somewhere else it says NT58-> t18? Wait, no. Looking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, some terminals appear under NT58, NT17, etc. For example:\n\n- NT58 -> t11, t18? Wait, I need to recheck:\n\nWait, I see NT28: NT28 can produce 't25' or 't56'. NT17 can produce 't29' or 't19'. NT58 has a rule: looking through, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided rules, in NT58 -> NT33 NT4, another production for NT58 is: NT58->t69? Wait no, perhaps I need to check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules: I see NT58 -> t18 (from NT58 -> t18 somewhere in the list? Wait, I need to check each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT58 -> t18 (No, because I don't see t18 under NT58. Let me check each rule:\n\nWait, looking in the grammar:\n\n- NT28 -> t56 and t25 (as in NT28 -> t56, NT28 -> t25)\n- NT73 -> t27\n- NT94 -> t57\n- NT17 -> t29\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for occurrences of t28, t45, etc., and see if they correspond to any non-terminals' productions.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So each step reduces a pair into one non-terminal, building the parse tree bottom-up.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try to reconstruct a possible parse tree for the given string.\n\nThe string has 37 tokens, but each production leads to two tokens, so perhaps the parse tree has to produce 37 tokens via combining pairs. But that might not be straightforward because each production rule can either extend into two tokens or reduce into one.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to simulate the grammar's behavior, perhaps using a top-down parser or looking for a reduction sequence that matches the string.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me try to outline how I might approach this.\n\nFirst, notice that the grammar is such that each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side (Chomsky Normal Form). So, during parsing, each rule application will replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either both non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but wait, in normal Chomsky NF, all productions are either NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a, so every production rule in the given grammar is either a terminal or two non-terminals. But in this case, looking at the provided grammar, all rules are productions where a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals.\n\nWait no, looking at the rules:\n\nFor example, S -> NT88 NT26. So S is a non-terminal, and it's replaced by NT88 and NT26, which are also non-terminals. Similarly, NT63 -> NT48 NT87, etc. There's also a rule like NT87 -> t76 t35 and another where t76 is a terminal. Wait, so some rules have terminals as part of the right-hand side. Therefore, in some cases, the right-hand side can contain a terminal, which means that part of the string can be matched directly.\n\nWait, but in standard Chomsky NF, productions are of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 a. So in this case, the given grammar is in Chomsky NF, which allows for the empty string as well, but in this case, all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the ones that have terminals, but wait, wait, no: in Chomsky NF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, but looking at the provided grammar, is that the case?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the grammar structure to confirm whether it's in Chomsky NF correctly. Chomsky NF requires that each production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal. But according to the provided grammar, most rules are of the form NT X \u2192 NT Y NT Z, which are two non-terminals, but I notice that some rules have terminals as part of the production.\n\nWait, in this case, looking at the provided grammar, I see that some rules are like NT28 -> t56 and NT28 -> t25.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string we're dealing with.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, and B, C are non-terminals or terminals. This structure makes parsing more straightforward, especially with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need to use that here.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's quite extensive. The initial symbol is S, and each production starts with S. For example, S -> NT88 NT26. Then, NT88 can produce other NTs, like NT48 NT87. This continues down until we reach terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers or just the number. For instance, NT7 becomes 't2', NT8 becomes 't29', and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t26 t12 t21 t36 t45 t12 t18 t6 t1 t25 t15 t16 t45 t29 t36 t29 t6 t27 t2 t6 t37 t8 t27 t54 t47 t17 t34 t39 t19 t18 t9 t18 t47`.\n\nFirst, I need to check the order in which the non-terminals are expanded. Since the grammar is in CNF, every production is two non-terminals or terminals, so the parse tree must be such that each step combines two symbols until we reach the bottom (terminals).\n\nI'll try to map the string back to the grammar by identifying sequences of terminals and seeing if they align with any production rules.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminals:\n\nt6, t26, t12, t21, t36, t45, t12, t18, t6, t1, t25, t15, t16, t45, t29, t36, t29, t6, t27, t2, t6, t37, t8, t27, t54, t47, t17, t34, t39, t19, t18, t9, t18, t47.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, each rule is a production from a non-terminal to two others. We can try to see if this string is a concatenation of the results of these productions.\n\nI'll start from the top-level production and see if the string can be derived.\n\nS -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the string should start with NT88 producing a sequence of terminals, followed by NT26 producing another sequence.\n\nLooking at NT88's production rules from the grammar:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nThen, NT8 -> 't29' and NT32 -> 't56'.\n\nWait, but that gives 't29 t56' for NT88. But in the string, the first few are t6, t26... which doesn't match t29 t56.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the first production in the string starts with t6. Looking back, where does t6 come from?\n\nFrom the grammar, let me find where 't6' is defined. Scanning through the rules:\n\nNT12 -> 't17' and NT12 -> 't23' (since NT12 appears multiple times with different productions). Wait, actually, going through each option might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be segmented into parts that correspond to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t6, which might come from NT66 or others.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT66 has a production: NT66 -> 't30'. But in the given grammar, I see NT66 -> 't30'. So 't6' might be part of NT66, but wait, does NT66 produce t6? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT66 definitions:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT56-> 't55', but I don't see NT66. Wait, the user provided a long list, perhaps I need to map more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the entire string and try to split it into the allowed sequences. Let me try to parse the string step by step, possibly considering the rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a derivation. Let's see:\n\nWe have S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of NT88's expansion and NT26's expansion.\n\nLet me check NT88's possible derivations:\n\nFrom S, NT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nThen, NT8 -> 't29' or 't27' (wait, looking back, NT7 produces 't2' or others, but maybe I need to find where t29 comes from).\n\nWait, let's look at NT8. In the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't29' (so one option is 't29').\n\nAnd NT32. Wait, looking for NT32, I see:\n\nNT32 -> 't56' (as per the grammar).\n\nSo, combining, NT88 -> t29 t56.\n\nBut in the string, the first part is t6. So, that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT88 can produce other sequences. Let's check other productions of NT88.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do I see any other production for NT88? Let me check:\n\nThe initial rule is S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, do other NTs refer to NT88? I don't see any other productions for NT88 except S -> NT88 NT26 and maybe others? Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79.\n\nWait, another NT88? Or no. It's better to think that S is the only place where NT88 appears in the productions except S. So, in the production tree, S branches into NT88 and NT26, each of which must be self-sustaining.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string starts with t6, which might be part of another NT.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Perhaps building the entire parse tree for the given string.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time, especially since it's a long string.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into parts that each match the grammar's terminals.\n\nLet me try to list all the terminals in the string:\n\nt6, t26, t12, t21, t36, t45, t12, t18, t6, t1, t25, t15, t16, t45, t29, t36, t29, t6, t27, t2, t6, t37, t8, t27, t54, t47, t17, t34, t39, t19, t18, t9, t18, t47.\n\nLet me see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, each rule's terminal end is given. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\n\nNT91 -> 't44'\n\nNT106... Wait, perhaps I should look for patterns. For example, 't6' is one of the terminals, and looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t6?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nLooking for 't6' in the terminal list of each production. For example:\n\nLooking through, I see NT55 -> 't8', but that's for NT55. Wait, no, NT17 -> 't29', NT26 -> 't58' or 't27'.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't immediately see any rule that produces 't6', but perhaps some other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Each production in the grammar can end with a terminal. So for example, NT7 is 't2', which is a terminal. But in the given grammar, I don't see any terminal with 't6' directly, but maybe some non-terminal produces it.\n\nWait, let me check each production to see if any end in 't6':\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT4 -> 't20'\n\nNT11 -> 't4' or 't30'\n\nWait, no 't6' in the terminals. Hmm, that's strange because the string starts with t6 and the grammar doesn't have t6 as a terminal. Did I miss something?\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the entire list again.

Let me go back.\n\nI think I can find where each terminal comes from. For instance, t36 is the output of NT2 -> 't36'.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t8. Looking for an NT that can derive t8. I see NT88 has NT88-> 't8', so S can start by expanding to NT88 and NT26. Then, we can take NT88 and see if it can derive the first t8.\n\nWait, but S is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the expansion starts with NT88, which can produce 't8', and then NT26 needs to produce something else.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because for the string to start with t8, NT88 must derive t8, and then NT26 must derive the rest of the string. But NT26 is a production that starts with NT26, so after t8, the next symbol comes from NT26.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the derivation as a sequence of productions that each expand non-terminals into either terminals or other non-terminals, building up the string.\n\nBut this might take a long time, especially since the string is 33 tokens long. Maybe another approach is to note that each production in CNF produces exactly two symbols, so if you have a string of length n, the number of productions in the derivation is n-1 (because each production adds one symbol). Wait, no: actually, each step of the derivation may produce two non-terminals, so it's possible that for a string of length m, the number of symbols in the derivation is based on the parse tree's nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the process: the string is a sequence of terminals, so starting from the end, we can see if the last symbol can be the result of a production's symbol. If so, maybe there's a way to backtrack.\n\nThe last token in the string is 't56'. Looking for an NT that produces 't56'. From the productions:\n\nLooking for 't56' as a terminal. I see NT22 -> 't12' and 't23', NT28 -> 't56' (from NT28). Wait, no:\n\nLooking through the list, I have:\n\n- NT22 is listed as NT22 \u2192 NT72 NT13\n- NT72 \u2192 't32', which is a terminal.\n- NT13 has several terminal productions, including 't27', 't21', etc.\nWait, is there an NT that produces t56?\n\nI see NT56 in NT35 \u2192 't44' and others? Or is it another NT?\n\nWait, let's check the productions:\n\nWait, looking through the list, NT79 -> 't22' and 't48' (from NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48), so t48 is produced by NT79. Looking for 't56' in the list, perhaps NT56 is in NT56 as a terminal.\n\nWait, no, let me go step by step.\n\nLooking for t56 in the productions, I see that NT28 is produced as NT28 \u2192 't56'. So one of the NTs that can produce t56 is NT28.\n\nSo the last part of the derivation could be NT28 -> t56.\n\nBefore that, what non-terminals can expand into a sequence ending with NT28 and producing t56?\n\nLooking at the string before t56 is ... t12 t60 t56. So before t56 is t60. So the expansion should reach a point where the last symbols before t56 are t60 and NT28.\n\nMeaning, the symbol before t56 in the derivation tree would be a non-terminal which can produce t60 followed by t56. Or, more accurately, a production that results in t60 followed by t56.\n\nWait, perhaps the last step is Y -> Z t56, where Y is an NT that can produce Z followed by T28.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last few symbols are generated by NT28 producing t56, and before that, another NT produces the rest.\n\nThis might be getting too detailed without a clear path, so perhaps I should check if each token in the string can be traced back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the parse tree from the start and see if I can reach the given string.\n\nBut this is time-consuming.

{"custom_id":"request-644","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. Notably, some non-terminals can produce terminal symbols directly, as seen in 't' strings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The grammar provided has non-terminals like S, NT63, NT26, and so on. Each of these non-terminals can produce other non-terminals or terminal symbols (t followed by numbers, I assume). My task is to see if the string given is derivable from the start symbol S using these productions.\n\nThe string provided is: t26 t44 t33 t19 t20 t23 t16 t11 t33 t33 t39 t34 t2 t60 t1 t21 t15 t56 t15 t9 t2 t36 t20 t57 t56 t4 t11 t29 t52 t28 t1 t49 t18 t9 t12.\n\nI notice that each part of the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers. Some of these correspond directly to non-terminals in the grammar, while others might be terminal symbols if they have a production rule.\n\nMy first approach is to look for the start symbol S in the string. The start symbol S is a non-terminal, so it should be part of the derivation process. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the first step is that S can produce NT88 followed by NT26.\n\nNow, the string starts with t26. Let's check if t26 is a terminal or if it's part of a non-terminal's expansion. Checking the grammar rules, under NT26, we have production NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So, NT26 is a non-terminal and can be expanded further. That means the first token in the string should be derived from NT26. However, looking at the string, the first token is t26, but according to the productions, NT26 doesn't produce a terminal directly. Instead, it goes through another non-terminal. So, maybe t26 is part of a production sequence down the line, not directly from S.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I need to look from the start symbol down. Let's see the production of S: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the entire string must start with the two non-terminals NT88 and NT26. So, the first two parts of the string should be the expansions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t26. Since NT26 must start with NT26, and in the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So, the expansion of NT26 would start with NT68 and NT13. But in the string, the first token is t26, not another NT production. That might mean that the string doesn't start correctly with S's expansion, implying it's not generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The initial step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string should start with the expansion of NT88 followed by NT26. Now, looking at the grammar, does NT88 produce a terminal directly? Let's check. NT88's productions are found under \"NT88\" in the grammar. Scanning the list, I don't see any production for NT88. So, NT88 only produces non-terminals. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, the string starts with t26, but in that case, it's a terminal symbol. But according to the grammar, NT26 (and thus the first part after NT88) must expand into NT68 and NT13, which are non-terminals. Therefore, the string's first token t26 should be reachable from NT26 or NT88, but if neither produces t26 directly, then it's a problem.\n\nWait, looking again, under NT77: production \u2192 NT33 NT79. Not matching. Let's check all the NT88's productions. I don't see any NT88 \u2192 ... So, NT88 must produce other non-terminals, which would have to be expanded further.\n\nIf NT88 doesn't produce t26 directly, then the string starting with t26 would not match the expansion of S, which requires NT88 followed by NT26. Therefore, this would imply that the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't26' is part of the expansion further down the grammar. For example, perhaps NT26 expands to NT68 and NT13, then NT13 \u2192 NT7 \u2192 t4, etc. But in the string, the first token is t26, not t4. So that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see if t26 is reachable at all in the grammar. Looking through the non-terminals, any of them can produce t26? Looking at all non-terminals, I don't see any production of the form NT... \u2192 t26. So, t26 must come from a non-terminal that has that as a terminal in its production. But from the given productions, I don't see that any non-terminal directly produces t26.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps through a chain of productions, a non-terminal can derive t26. But looking through all the non-terminals, I don't see any that include t26 in their productions. So, it's impossible for any non-terminal to directly or indirectly produce t26. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that NT66 \u2192 t30, and NT13 can produce t12, t29, etc. But no NT produces t26 directly. So, unless there's a production rule that I missed, t26 isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, since the string starts with t26 and that's not reachable from any non-terminal in the grammar, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-645","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, so I'll need to walk through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF grammars have each production rule being of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, I need to check if all the rules in this grammar fit that form. Scanning through the rules, most of them are of the form NTsomething \u2192 NTsomething TT or NTsomething \u2192 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. So, the grammar seems to be in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to generate a parse tree for the string provided to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is: t2 t27 t34 t21 t32 t6 t37 t28 t12 t9 t23 t17 t20 t54 t19 t32 t49 t39 t11 t37 t32 t23 t37 t39 t47 t15 t15 t19 t26 t26 t9 t18 t57 t48 t29.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, the string length should be such that it can be broken down into the necessary steps. In CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree, so the number of symbols should result in a length that matches, considering the rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 47 symbols long. Let's consider how that breaks down. Starting from S -> NT88 NT26. The string starts with t2 and ends with t29. So, perhaps each NT in the grammar can be associated with a terminal, and each step should decompose the NTs into their components.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step, keeping track of possible derivations.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S = NT88. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the first non-terminal is NT88.\n\nLooking at NT88 \u2192 NT88's productions. Checking the grammar, NT88 is not present as a non-terminal, but looking back, I might have misread. Wait, the grammar provided is extensive. Let me check for NT88.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So, NT88 is part of the grammar. So, S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT32 NT26.\n\nNow, let's look at NT88. It's decomposed into NT8 and NT32. Let's see if these can produce the starting symbols.\n\nLooking for NT8 in the grammar. Let me scan through the rules for NT8. Hmm, I see NT8 as appearing multiple times, maybe. Wait, the rule NT8 is not present in the provided list, but wait, in the beginning, in the production, NT8 was part of NT48 \u2192 NT8 NT32.

{"custom_id":"request-647","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: `t20 t37 t16 t9 t53 t38 t39 t60 t20 t60 t54 t34 t34 t36 t30 t45 t47 t11 t1 t15 t30 t9 t60 t45 t29 t52 t39 t1 t54 t33 t29 t36 t29 t19 t20 t57`. Hmm, that's a lot of tokens. First, I should look at the grammar and see how these tokens relate to the non-terminals, especially since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol that can go to terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S is the start symbol, and it generates two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Now, I'll need to see if each of these can derive a terminal string, and whether the combination matches the given string.\n\nLet me try to break this down step by step. Starting with S, we have:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNow, I need to find what NT88 and NT26 can produce. Looking through the rules, I see NT88 appears in the production: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So S becomes NT8 NT32 NT26. Next, I need to see what each of these can produce.\n\nStarting with NT8. Looking at the grammar, NT8 isn't a non-terminal; instead, production rules involve NT8 on the left side but not as a terminal. Wait, but in the tokens, I see 't29', 't49', etc., which are terminals. However, the non-terminals that can lead to terminals are the ones that have productions leading to 't' followed by a number. For example, looking at the rules, some NTs have terminals like NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58, but I'm not sure if they produce terminals directly. Wait, the grammar might have some NTs that can derive into the terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC. So in this case, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others. To get a terminal in the string, we must have a production that eventually leads to a terminal. So for a terminal 't...', there must be a non-terminal that can derive into that terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example: NT72 \u2192 t32. So NT72 can produce the terminal t32. Similarly, other NTs have rules that end with 't' followed by a number, which are terminals. So to get the tokens in the string, I need to see the derivation path that results in those tokens.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step, starting from S and trying to build the string.\n\nThe string starts with t20. So we need to see if S can produce a string starting with t20. Looking at S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So t20 could be produced by NT26. So let's see, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Both are non-terminals. Now, NT68 and NT13 need to produce terminals.\n\nLooking at NT68: In the rules, NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 and NT28 are non-terminals. Then NT54 \u2192 NT8 NT34. NT8 is a non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I should backtrack because this might not be leading directly to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if any of the NTs directly produce a terminal. For example, NT72 \u2192 t32. So if we can derive t32, that's useful. But the string starts with t20. So perhaps I need to find how to produce t20 starting from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT2 \u2192 t36, NT9 \u2192 t54, NT11 \u2192 t21, NT94 \u2192 t57, etc. Hmm, perhaps t20 can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT50 \u2192 t38, NT53 \u2192 t48, NT40 \u2192 t60? Wait, let me check the rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 t60.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nYes, NT40 \u2192 t60. So if I have NT40, it can produce t60.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t20. Let me check the rules for NTs that can produce t20. Looking through the rules, I see NT30 doesn't appear, but perhaps other NTs do. For example, NT30 \u2192 is there any rule with NT30? Looking at the given rules, I don't see NT30 producing anything, so perhaps it's a non-terminal that only produces further non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me try a different approach. Let me see if the string is a valid derivation starting from S.\n\nThe string starts with t20. So somewhere, the grammar must produce t20 as part of the terminal sequence. Let's see which NT can produce t20.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t20. But perhaps a chain of productions leads to t20.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. For example, NT42 \u2192 t18, NT40 \u2192 t60, NT38 \u2192 t40, NT48 \u2192 t27, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t20 is produced by a non-terminal, say NT20, which has a rule NT20 \u2192 t34, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for t20 in the string sequence and see if it's possible. Let's break down the string into individual tokens and see if each can be produced by a non-terminal that can derive into that token.\n\nLooking at the first token, t20. Is there a non-terminal NT that can produce t20? Looking through the rules:\n\nNT20 \u2192 t34.\n\nSo if we have NT20, it produces t34. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe t20 is the result of a production where a non-terminal is split into two terminals.\n\nWait, for example, if a non-terminal like NT26 \u2192 t20 t36, but I don't see such a rule. So perhaps I need to see if after some steps, the non-terminals can split into the required terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given string is a mix of several NT productions, and I need to check each token against the possible NT productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Let's see:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo the first step is that S is split into NT88 and NT26. Now, to get t20 somewhere, perhaps the NT26 can derive into t20 and something else. Let's look at NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo NT26 splits into NT68 and NT13.\n\nNow, can either NT68 or NT13 derive into terminal t20? Let's look.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT8 NT34.\n\nNT8 is a non-terminal, as NT8 \u2192 something? Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see NT8 directly producing a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that can produce t20 directly. Is there such a non-terminal? Looking through the rules, I don't see any. So perhaps t20 can't be produced directly. So maybe I need to see if the string is invalid because a non-terminal that would produce t20 doesn't appear, making the overall string impossible.\n\nThus, without a non-terminal that can directly produce t20, it might not be possible to generate the string, hence the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-653","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar and the target string to see if they match. The string given is: `t60 t30 t52 t45 t30 t16 t36 t6 t15 t9 t53 t47 t19 t55 t49 t1 t25 t2 t39 t1 t48 t16 t18 t30 t44 t1 t56 t4 t44 t36 t55 t38 t55 t33 t20 t29`. \n\nWow, that's a lot of tokens separated by spaces. I notice that these look like terminal symbols, which are the actual characters or substrings generated by the grammar. Each token represents a single terminal symbol. So, the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe problem now is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since all productions are in Chomsky normal form, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals, and eventually, the non-terminals will be replaced by terminals.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the grammar to identify the production rules that start with the start symbol S. Looking through the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol, and its production rule is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, S is replaced by NT88 and NT26. \n\nNext, each of these non-terminals (NT88 and NT26) needs to be further broken down. I'll look up their production rules in the grammar. \n\nStarting with NT88: From the grammar, I see NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So, NT88 is replaced by NT8 and NT32. \n\nNow, NT8 is another non-terminal. Checking its production, it's in the grammar: NT8 \u2192 't29'. So, NT8 is a terminal symbol 't29'.\n\nNext, NT32's production: Looking through the rules, I find NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. \n\nSo, NT32 becomes NT73 and NT42. Now, both NT73 and NT42 need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking for NT73: It's in the grammar as NT73 \u2192 't27'. So, NT73 becomes 't27'.\n\nNow, NT42: Its production rule is NT42 \u2192 NT30 NT18.\n\nSo, NT42 becomes NT30 and NT18. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nStarting with NT30: Checking the grammar, I see NT30 \u2192 't52'. So, NT30 is 't52'.\n\nNow, NT18: Its production is NT18 \u2192 't15'. Wait, looking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT18 \u2192 't15'. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I have NT18 \u2192 't47', 't15', and 't6'. Wait, is that correct? Let me check the grammar provided:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't47' and NT18 \u2192 't15' and NT18 \u2192 't6'. Hmm, but in the string, after 't29', we have 't15', which aligns with NT18 \u2192 't15'. So, when expanding NT18, it becomes 't15'.\n\nSo, putting this together, the expansion of NT42 (which is NT30 NT18) becomes 't52' followed by 't15'.\n\nSo, so far, expanding S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT32 NT26.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me backtrack because I'm getting a bit confused. Let me outline the steps more systematically.\n\nStarting with S:\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n2. NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n3. NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n4.

Let me reorganize.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, to expand S, we have to expand each of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet's do that step by step.\n\nExpanding NT88:\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n  - NT73 \u2192 't27'\n  - NT42 \u2192 NT30 NT18\n    - NT30 \u2192 't52'\n    - NT18 \u2192 't15'\n\nSo, the expansion of NT88 is 't29' followed by the expansion of NT32, which is 't27 t52 t15'.\n\nNow, expanding NT26:\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n- NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\n  - NT54 \u2192 't16'\n  - NT28 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo, NT68 \u2192 't16 t25'\n\n- NT13 \u2192 't27' (Wait, no. Let me check the grammar. Looking back, I see NT13 \u2192 't27' and also NT41 \u2192 't6'. But in the expansion, NT13 would just be 't27', right?\n\nWait, no, let's double-check the grammar. The production for NT13 appears multiple times:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69 (somewhere)\nNT13 \u2192 't27'\nNT13 \u2192 't30'\nNT13 \u2192 't12' etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through all the rules, I think NT13 \u2192 't27' is one of the rules. Let me make sure.\n\nLooking through the rules provided, one of them is NT13 \u2192 't27'. So, when NT13 is encountered, it can be replaced by 't27'. So, in the expansion of NT13, it's just 't27'.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, I see:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar lines, I find:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't27' and NT13 \u2192 't30' etc. Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, looking for NT13:\n\nLine number 14: NT13 \u2192 't27'\nLine 25: NT13 \u2192 't30'\nLine 47: NT13 \u2192 't12'\nLine 68: NT13 \u2192 't14'\nLine 86: NT13 \u2192 't50'\nWait, but in the initial expansion of NT26, we have NT13 appearing in NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, which is then NT68 \u2192 't16' 't25' and then NT13 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSo, NT13 \u2192 't27'.\n\nTherefore, the expansion of NT26:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 't16' 't25' 't27'\n\nPutting it all together, the expansion of S is:\n\nNT88 \u2192 't29' 't27' 't52' 't15'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't16' 't25' 't27'\n\nSo, combined, the expansion is 't29 t27 t52 t15 t16 t25 t27'\n\nWait, but the given string is much longer. That can't be right because the initial expansion of S produces a sequence of four tokens, not the 50 or so tokens in the string. So, something's wrong here. Maybe I didn't go deep enough into the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to continue expanding further. Because the initial expansion only gives a few tokens, but the string has many more. So, perhaps I'm missing more levels of expansion.\n\nWait, no. The initial S \u2192 NT88 NT26, but NT88 and NT26 each expand further into more non-terminals, and each of those can further expand.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't49', 't57', etc. Since each production rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, I can think of the string as a sequence of these production steps.\n\nStarting from the start symbol S, the grammar first produces NT88 and NT26. Both of these must be expanded further. Let me look at how NT88 and NT26 are defined.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nLooking at NT8 and NT32, I see that:\n- NT8 \u2192 't29' (a terminal)\n- NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n  - NT73 \u2192 't27'\n  - NT42 \u2192 't18' (terminal)\nSo NT32 \u2192 't27' 't18' \u2192 't27t18'\n\nNow NT88 becomes NT8 NT32 \u2192 't29' + 't27t18' \u2192 't29 t27 t18'\n\nNext, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n- NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\n  - NT54 \u2192 't16'\n  - NT28 \u2192 't56'\nSo NT68 \u2192 't16' 't56' \u2192 't16 t56'\n- NT13 \u2192 't12' (terminal)\n\nSo NT26 \u2192 't16 t56' 't12' \u2192 't16 t56 t12'\n\nCombining NT88 and NT26, the entire S production becomes:\n't29 t27 t18' 't16 t56 t12' \u2192 t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t12\n\nLooking at the string, the beginning is t49 t57... which doesn't match t29 t27... So either I made a mistake, or the start symbol isn't being followed correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I didn't consider that each production might have more than one way to expand. Let me double-check the NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, NT88 is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which is 't29 t27 t18' followed by 't16 t56 t12', so combined: t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t12. The given string starts with t49, which doesn't match. That suggests that either my analysis is wrong or the string isn't generated.\n\nBut maybe I should check the entire expansion step by step for the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string needs to be divided into the productions from S.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string starts with the concatenation of S's two parts, which are NT88 followed by NT26.\n\nLooking at the string: t49 t57 t25 t15 t39 t27 t60 t19 t48 t18 t15 t32 t39 t37 t15 t52 t34 t16 t11 t49 t34 t48 t52 t52 t34 t15 t23 t47 t15 t45 t20 t47 t15 t29 t60 t44 t2.\n\nThe first two tokens are t49 and t57.

Let me check other productions for NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88 in the grammar: only one rule, which is NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo no, there's only one way to produce NT88 and NT26.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the string should be t29 t27 t18.\n\nBut the given string starts with t49, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a derivation tree.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to write a parser or use a method to check if the string can be derived.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, a recursive descent parser could work, or even a simple substitution method.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to see if the string can be divided into the two parts of S: NT88 and NT26, each generating their parts.\n\nSo first part: NT88 should generate a sequence that starts with the tokens of NT88.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29'.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nSo NT73 expands to 't27' or 't48'?

No, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nLooking for NT73, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't27' (but wait, no\u2014actually, under NT73, I see one of the productions is NT73 \u2192 't27', but elsewhere, under NT48, there's a production NT48 \u2192 't27' \u2192 but that's a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's clearer if I make a list of all the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nBut this can be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that a non-terminal NT expands into a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t49, which I don't see being part of any production of NT88 or NT26, perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.

Looking through the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand to 'tX', like NT50 \u2192 't38', NT2 \u2192 't36', etc. But none seem to expand to 't49' directly. Perhaps t49 is part of a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, looking through all the NTs, is there any NT that expands to 't49'?

For example:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 which is non-terminals, so not a terminal.\n- NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70\n- NT66 \u2192 NT30 NT90\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n- NT55 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT28 \u2192 NT56 NT48\nAh, wait! NT28 \u2192 't56' and 't28' is in the rules? No, looking again:\n\nWait, NT28 is defined as something else. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 appears in two places: in NT56's production and in NT58.\n\nWait, the rules for NT58: \n\nLooking for NT58:\n\nYes, in the list, I found:\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\nand\nNT58 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo, NT58 can produce either 't28' or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't26'. So, for 't26' to be produced, there must be a non-terminal that can produce 't26', or a production that eventually leads to 't26' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't26'. So I'm missing something. Maybe I should check more carefully.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\nLooking for any non-terminal that can derive into 't26'. I don't see any. So that suggests that 't26' can't be the result of a single production step because no rule for any NT directly produces it. So that would imply that 't26' can't be in the string, meaning the entire string is invalid. But that can't be right because perhaps the string starts further down.\n\nWait, no, the string is given, so each token must be generated by some path from S. So if 't26' is the first token, it must come from some NT \u2192 ... leading to it. But none of the rules produce 't26' directly or indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Since the grammar is in CNF, all productions split into two non-terminals on the right side, and each of those can further split. So each token is generated from a chain of productions, each adding two symbols (if non-terminals) until we reach terminals.\n\nBut 't26' is a single terminal. So it must come from a non-terminal that eventually produces it through a chain of productions.\n\nLooking again through the rules, I'm trying to find an NT that can derive into 't26'.\n\nUpon checking all the rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't26' either directly or indirectly. The closest I have is NT28 \u2192 't56' or 't28', but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 or 't28'\n\nNo, NT58 doesn't produce 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, other rules:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal expands into 't26' as one of the terminals in a pair. For example:\n\nLooking at:\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT55 NT33 \u2192 NT55 is 't52' (from NT55 \u2192 't52') and NT33 \u2192 't1' \u2192 so NT59 would produce 't52' and 't1', which is 't52t1'.\n\nAnother possible path: look for any NT that can produce 't26', perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 \u2192 from NT17 produces 't29' and NT58 can produce 't28', but that's 't29t28'.\n\nAlternatively, let's check all the rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, for any NT that eventually leads to 't26':\n\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 \u2192 produces 't29' and something else\n- NT73 \u2192 't75' and 't83'? Check NT75 and NT83\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Perhaps a better approach is to see whether 't26' can be generated.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 which would produce two non-terminals, so 't26' would have to come from NT26 expanding into other non-terminals until they reach terminals.\n\nBut looking further, NT68 \u2192 NT54"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-675","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is useful because it has a two-symbol left-hand side and a right-hand side with either one or two symbols. But in this case, it seems like all productions are two-symbol, so maybe it's strictly in CNF with productions that generate two symbols.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t57 t28 t15 t54 t20 t27 t20 t16 t45 t56 t12 t36 t26 t27 t11 t57 t8 t2 t15 t48 t48 t4 t27 t16 t56 t33 t56 t23 t48 t18 t47 t12 t6 t16 t30 t8 t25 t20`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the parsing would work. Since the grammar is in CNF, each symbol in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. Each production can generate two symbols, and the string is a series of these symbols, so the parsing process would involve splitting the string into pairs and seeing if each pair corresponds to a production.\n\nI should note that if the string is of even length, it can be paired, but some productions generate two terminals, so maybe it's okay. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals might need to split into more non-terminals, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look through each production and see how they generate the terminals.\n\nLet me list out the grammar productions again to see which terminals they produce:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22\n- NT73 -> NT75 NT83\n- NT51 -> NT70 NT94\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69\n- NT2 -> NT87 NT70\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT91 -> NT2 NT33\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n- NT68 -> NT54 NT28\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87 (Wait, I see NT17 appears in two productions, so need to check if they lead to the same or different terminals)\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83 (So multiple productions for NT13 with different right-hand sides, some leading to NT58 and others to NT83? Or maybe in this case, the second production for NT13 is different from the first. Let me see: NT13 is split into NT58 and NT83, and also into NT53 and NT33. Wait, the third NT13 is `NT13 -> NT53 NT33`, and the fourth is `NT13 -> NT85 NT40`. Hmm, that's different. So perhaps NT13 has several productions with different non-terminals on the right-hand side.)\n\nWait, looking back, the list of productions is quite long, so I need to make sure I capture each. Let me try to parse through each production step-by-step.\n\nAnother approach is to write down each production's right-hand side and see if the string can be broken down accordingly. Since the string is a sequence of ts, but the non-terminals might generate these. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let me clarify: in the string, each symbol is a terminal except for numbers, but wait in this grammar, all the symbols are non-terminals except when they generate terminals. But looking at the productions, some right-hand sides are non-terminals, some have a mix, and some are two terminals. For example:\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18: So NT48 produces NT2 and NT18, which are non-terminals. Wait, no, no: the right-hand side is NT2 and NT18, so NT48 produces NT2 followed by NT18, but then NT2 and NT18 might each be non-terminals that have their own productions.\n\nWait, no: in this grammar, each NT (Non-Terminal) can produce a string of NTs and terminals. Each production is of the form NT -> X Y where X and Y can be NTs or terminals.\n\nBut wait, in context-free grammars, the productions can have terminals and non-terminals, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar provided, it seems some productions have terminals on the right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58: Both are non-terminals, but wait, earlier I see NT41 has production `NT41 -> NT77 NT18`, which would be a production of NT41 producing NT77 followed by NT18. But some other productions, like NT63 -> NT48 NT87, do we have NT48 and NT87 as terminals? Wait, in the initial list, NT48 is a non-terminal, as it's followed by other productions. But in the string, we have symbols like t17, t28, etc., which are terminals. So perhaps in this grammar, the terminals are the numbers ending with 't', like t1, t2, etc.\n\nWait, but in the grammar rules, some productions generate terminals, some don't. For example, the rule `NT2 -> t34` suggests that NT2 is a production that can produce a terminal 't34'. Similarly, others like NT88 -> t8 t32, etc.\n\nSo, when looking at the string, each element is either a terminal (like t27) or a non-terminal (like NT48, etc.). But I'm a bit confused because the string consists entirely of 't's with numbers, so maybe all these non-terminals in the grammar also produce these terminals in some way.\n\nSo the parsing would involve starting from the top-level symbol, which from the grammar is S. The first rule is S -> NT88 NT26, so the string starts with NT88 and NT26, each of which might be non-terminals that have productions, or they might be terminals.\n\nWait no, in the grammar, S is the start symbol, and its production is NT88 and NT26, both of which are non-terminals since they have other productions. Wait, but perhaps NT88 can produce 't8 t32' as per one of the rules. Similarly, NT26 may produce 't68 t13' or other combinations.\n\nWait, no: each non-terminal's production is a set of rules. For example, looking at NT88, there's a production `NT88 -> NT8 t32`, which would mean that NT88 can produce NT8 followed by t32. But then NT8 would produce other things. Alternatively, NT88 may have a production `NT88 -> t8 t32`. Let me check the full list.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83\n- NT88 -> NT8 t32\n- Similarly, NT20 -> NT51 NT72, and so on.\n\nWait, so some NTs produce terminals and non-terminals, others produce only non-terminals. So for example, NT48 can produce NT2 and NT18, which in turn may produce more non-terminals and terminals.\n\nSo to parse the string, I'll need to start from the top-level S and see if the string can be broken down into symbols that match the productions.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t57 t28 t15 t54 t20 t27 t20 t16 t45 t56 t12 t36 t26 t27 t11 t57 t8 t2 t15 t48 t48 t4 t27 t16 t56 t33 t56 t23 t48 t18 t47 t12 t6 t16 t30 t8 t25 t20.\n\nFirst, let's check the length: 42 symbols. Since each production can produce one or two symbols, and the initial S starts with NT88 and NT26, each of which probably produces at least two symbols, I need to see if the string can be completely split into such pairs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that the starting symbols from S must"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So S can be broken down into two parts: NT88 and NT26. Let me check if both parts can generate the corresponding tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the first token, t49. From the grammar, NT40 -> t6. Wait, t49 isn't a terminal; in the grammar, NT40 -> t6, but perhaps I need to look elsewhere. Let me check the terminal productions. Oh, I see some inconsistencies.

Maybe t49 is generated by some NT rule I missed. Let me scan all the NT rules for t49. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that ends with t49.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string to be evaluated.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Each of these NT symbols must eventually expand into a string of terminals and\/or NTs. Since it's CNF, every expansion step will replace a non-terminal with exactly two others.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t45 t28 t19 t56 t57 t17 t28 t52 t15 t53 t37 t20 t47 t9 t33 t55 t48 t38 t1 t9 t45 t28 t23 t36 t16 t37 t28 t11 t52 t19 t1 t57 t36 t32 t38 t23 t60 t49 t20\". It's a sequence of t-terms, so I'm guessing each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol.\n\nI'll need to parse this string according to the grammar. Parsing with a top-down approach, starting from S, would be a good strategy. But manually expanding S into NT88 and NT26, and then each of those into NTs and so on is going to be tedious, especially since the grammar is quite complex with many rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a specific way the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions. Another approach could be to reverse the process: try to match the string from the end, seeing if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list down the top-level productions and see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the entire string should start with NT88 and then NT26. Looking at the string, the first token is 't45', so perhaps NT88 can expand to include 't45' in some way.\n\nWait, but NT88 is on the left, so when expanding, it should generate two non-terminals on the right, which will then expand further. So the entire string should be a series of expansions starting from S, each step replacing a non-terminal with two others, and eventually reaching terminals.\n\nBut manually doing this for such a long string is impractical. Maybe I can look for specific patterns or terminals that can help backtrack.\n\nLooking at the string, the last token is 't20'. Let's see which non-terminals expand into 't20'. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT20 -> NT51 NT72\n- NT51 -> NT2 -> NT51 \u2192 ... wait, NT51 is defined as NT13 -> NT70 NT94, and NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12, and so on. Hmm, maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking in the right-hand sides, 't20' appears in NT20's expansion as NT51 and NT72. Also, looking at NT50: NT50 \u2192 't38', which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the string: ... t49 t20. So the last part is t49 t20. Let me see if any production ends with NT49 NT20.\n\nLooking up the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing 't49' in their RHS. However, NT is defined as NT40 \u2192 't60', NT42 \u2192 't18', etc. So maybe 't49' comes from some NT.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the last two tokens. The last two are 't49 t20'. Maybe that's the expansion of NT40 and NT20, but I'm not sure. Let's see:\n\nLooking up NT20's production: NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72. So the last part is NT51 and NT72. But in the string, the last two are 't49 t20'. That might not match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last part is part of a longer expansion. It's getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach: maybe build a parse tree from the string by trying to match the top-level productions.\n\nThe top-level is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string should be a concatenation of the expansion of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the start of the string: 't45 t28 t19 t56 t57 t17 t28 t52 t15 t53 t37 t20 t47 t9 t33 t55 t48 t38 t1 t9 t45 t28 t23 t36 t16 t37 t28 t11 t52 t19 t1 t57 t36 t32 t38 t23 t60 t49 t20'.\n\nSo NT88 should expand into something starting with 't45', and NT26 should expand into something starting with 't20' because the next token after is 't20' if we split at NT26's end.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list, so the expansion will generate tokens in sequence. So after expanding NT88, the next expansion should be NT26, whose first token is 't20'.\n\nLooking up the production for NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So when NT26 expands, its first output is NT68, which should start with 't66'? Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at NT68's production: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. Then NT54 \u2192 NT16, NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83.\n\nWait, this is getting too nested. Maybe I should instead look for the first token in the string, 't45', and see which NT could generate it.\n\nLooking through the productions for 't45', I see that NT57 \u2192 't45'. So perhaps the expansions leading up to NT57 should produce 't45'.\n\nLooking at NT57: NT57 \u2192 NT22 NT45. Wait, no, looking back: the provided grammar has NT57 \u2192 't45', because in the list, for example, under NT48: NT48 \u2192 NT22 NT45, but that's in the left side. Oh wait, but some productions have 't' as a terminal on the right side.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, each replacing a non-terminal symbol with two others, except for the terminals which are the base cases. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, and I need to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are either non-terminals or terminals. This structure is helpful because it means that any derivation will involve expanding non-terminals into pairs of other symbols, until all that's left are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-696","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm presented with a task where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive, with multiple production rules, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF entails. CNF requires every production rule to have exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a single non-terminal. Also, all terminals must be directly reachable from the start symbol through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems to be in CNF because all production rules (like S -> NT88 NT26, NT63 -> NT48 NT87, etc.) have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. The only terminals are the 't' followed by digits, like t55, t60, etc., and some rules might produce these terminals. Wait, actually, looking back, some rules do have terminal symbols (like NT7 -> NT11 NT22, but looking at the rules, some of them have 't' followed by numbers, so those would be terminals that can't be further expanded.\n\nWait, the problem statement lists all the production rules. The start symbol is S. The productions for NT vary, and some seem to have terminal symbols. For example, the production NT32 -> NT73 NT42, but I'm noticing that some rules like NT7 -> NT11 NT22 might eventually lead to terminals like t4, t29, etc. But looking through, I don't immediately see any rule that directly produces a terminal except in the last part where NT7, NT48, etc., produce 't' followed by numbers. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, some NT symbols like NT7 produce 't29' (e.g., NT7 -> 't29'). Wait, no, some of the rules have 'x' mappings to 't' followed by numbers. For instance, NT7 -> 't27', NT17 -> 't29', etc.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, the grammar has some rules where, for example, NT7 has a production that maps to a terminal like 't27' or 't53'. So, that suggests that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. So, for instance, NT7 can produce 't27', and NT17 can produce 't29'. Other rules may have both non-terminals and terminals, but since CNF requires that all productions are two non-terminals, then having a production like NT7 -> 't27' is problematic because it has a terminal on the RHS instead of two non-terminals. Wait, but that's not correct. CNF allows the start symbol S to produce a single terminal, but all other productions in the grammar must have two non-terminals. If any other non-terminal produces a terminal, that might be allowed, but in this grammar, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT88 NT26. Both are non-terminals. The rest of the productions all seem to have two non-terminals on the RHS, except perhaps some that produce terminals. For example, some rules directly produce a 't' followed by a number, which would be terminals, not non-terminals. For instance, NT7 -> 't27', which would mean that NT7 is a production that goes to a terminal, but in CNF, the productions should only involve non-terminals. Wait, no, actually in CNF, the productions are either A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. But that's for Generalized CNF. In standard CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. So, if a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, that's not CNF. That suggests that the grammar provided isn't in strict CNF, but perhaps it's a variant because some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, this might complicate things. Because in standard CNF, there are no terminals in the productions except possibly for the start symbol. So, if this grammar has non-terminals producing terminals, it's not standard CNF, but maybe in this problem, the production rules are acceptable. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken, and all the productions still have two non-terminals except when they reduce to terminals. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some of the right-hand sides include 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals. For example, the production NT58 -> NT33 NT68? No, wait, actually, looking at the rules, each production has two non-terminals on the RHS. Wait, for example, NT72 -> 't33'? Wait no, looking back: One of the rules is NT72 -> 't33'. Wait, that can't be, because 't33' is a terminal. So, if NT72 can produce a terminal, that's not standard production for CNF, which only allows non-terminals on RHS. So, perhaps this grammar isn't in proper CNF, but since the problem states it is, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production rules don't have any terminals except for the start symbol. Wait, let me check. Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any that produce a terminal except for those where a non-terminal directly maps to a 't' followed by digits. For example, NT51 -> 't39', NT73 -> 't1', etc. So, these are productions where a non-terminal (like NT51) directly produces a terminal (t39), which violates CNF, because CNF doesn't allow terminals on the RHS except for the very last step. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe NT7 -> 't27' means that NT7 can produce 't27', which is a terminal, but in CNF, this would require that NT7 is allowed to produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but in standard CNF, a production can have a single terminal on the right side, but only the start symbol can produce a terminal. All other non-terminals must produce non-terminals. But in this case, many non-terminals seem to be directly producing terminals, which contradicts CNF. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the grammar. Maybe the 't's are actually part of the non-terminals, or perhaps the grammar is in a different form. Alternatively, perhaps these 't's are part of the context, but in any case, I think the key is to try to parse the given string using this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is that each production, whether it produces terminals or not, must be applied in such a way that the left-hand side is a non-terminal. So, in this case, each rule is a non-terminal producing either two non-terminals or a terminal. But since the problem says it's in CNF, perhaps the way to approach this is to build the parse tree bottom-up, using the given productions.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to generate all possible strings that can be derived from the grammar and see if the given string is among them. However, given that the string is rather long, that approach isn't practical.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to perform a top-down parsing or bottom-up parsing. Since the string given starts with 't55', which is a terminal, perhaps the first step is to see if any non-terminal can directly produce 't55'. Looking at the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals, such as NT58 -> NT33 NT4. Wait, no, that's not a terminal. Looking again, perhaps I'm not seeing which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking more closely at the production rules, I see several that have terminals in the RHS. For example, the production NT88 -> NT8 NT32, and others. Hmm, no, actually, most of the rightsides are combinations of other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps the terminals are at a lower level. For example, production NT2 -> 't36'. Yes, that's a terminal. Similarly, NT8 -> 't29', and NT51 -> 't39', etc. So, perhaps the grammar allows certain non-terminals to directly produce a terminal. If that's the case, then perhaps the process of parsing involves choosing when to apply these terminal productions.\n\nGiven that, the approach would be to try to build the parse tree starting from the start symbol S, and see if we can derive the given string.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to model this as a pushdown automaton, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to think of this as a context-free grammar where some non-terminals can produce a single terminal, so the grammar allows for non-terminals to have productions to a terminal. But in standard CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, so perhaps this grammar isn't in proper CNF. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now, but perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that it's given as a CNF, and proceed with that.\n\nBut perhaps I should note that in the given grammar, each production has exactly two"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let's list them out to see what we have: t4, t9, t28, t45, t49, t15, t38, t2, t28, t57, t29, t38, t55, t30, t1, t8, t45, t56, t44, t28, t38, t17, t15, t19, t18, t27, t16, t20, t44, t39, t49, t23, t49, t49, t9, t26, t15, t30, t34, t36, t29.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. There are no productions with more than two symbols on the right-hand side, and no terminals are on the right except for some specific cases where terminals might be part of the productions, like in the rules where NT... becomes 'something'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 t2, NT17 \u2192 t29, etc. These are the leaf nodes in the grammar tree.\n\nSo, my approach should be to parse the given string against the grammar, trying to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process would involve a series of steps where we replace non-terminals with two other non-terminals until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nBut manually parsing a string of 36 tokens might be time-consuming. However, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think about the possible starting point. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT88 and NT26. So, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then, each of these non-terminals will expand further.\n\nLooking at NT88 and NT26, let me check their productions. NT88 can be NT8 NT32, and NT26 can be NT68 NT13. So, the string will start with NT88 NT26, which then becomes NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 and NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, the string starts with t4 (from NT8?), followed by t28, t45, etc. Let's see which non-terminals correspond to these terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't29' (from NT8's productions, yes: NT8\u2192 't29')\n- NT28 \u2192 't56' (from the grammar)\n- t45 comes from NT45? Wait, wait, looking through the productions, some non-terminals directly map to t. For example, NT44 \u2192 't44'? Wait, no, looking at the list, I see NT40 \u2192 't6', NT41 \u2192 't49', NT48 \u2192 't2', etc. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking again:\n\nNT7 \u2192 \"t2\"\nNT17 \u2192 \"t29\"\nNT55 \u2192 \"t52\"\nNT8 \u2192 \"t29\"\nNT11 \u2192 \"t4\"\nNT17 \u2192 \"t29\"\n...\nBut looking at all the productions, the terminals are things like \"t4\", \"t9\", \"t28\", etc.\n\nWait, for example, NT75 \u2192 \"t60\", NT35 \u2192 \"t44\", NT33 \u2192 \"t1\", NT48 \u2192 \"t27\", etc.\n\nWait, to get the terminal tokens, each terminal in the string must be generated by a production from a non-terminal that eventually reaches that terminal via production rules.\n\nSo, let's take the first token: t4. Looking through the productions, which non-terminals produce t4? Let's see.\n\nIn the provided grammar, I don't immediately see any direct productions that produce t4. Wait, let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the productions, only specific ones produce 't' strings.

Hmm.\n\nWait a minute, none of the rules directly produce t4. So, t4 must be produced by a non-terminal elsewhere. So, perhaps a non-terminal that eventually produces t4. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals can derive to a production that eventually reaches t4.\n\nLooking up:\n\nDo any non-terminals have t4 as a terminal or as a path through other rules?\n\nLooking at NT49, which is derived from NT40 and NT9 (since NT40 \u2192 t6 and NT98 \u2192 t45, perhaps it's part of a chain, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, from the given grammar, I need to see if any non-terminal produces t4.

Wait, NT58 is t28.\nWait, perhaps I should look for t4 in any rule. Looking at all the productions, the only place where a terminal t appears is in the rules that are given. So perhaps I should track where each t comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal NT72 \u2192 t44, and some other non-terminal may derive to MT72, which then produces t44.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model this as a parsing problem. Let's try to find a way to parse the given string from left to right using the grammar.\n\nBut considering that the string is quite long, maybe an alternative approach is possible. Perhaps looking for possible contradictions or ensuring the string can be derived through the grammar.\n\nLet me think about the tokens one by one.\n\nFirst token: t4. As per the grammar, t4 is not directly produced by any non-terminal. So t4 must be derived from a chain of non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which non-terminal can derive to t4. Let's see:\n\nWait, maybe a non-terminal has a rule that includes t4 as a terminal in its expansion.

The start symbol is S, which is defined as NT88 NT26. Each non-terminal (like NT88, NT26, etc.) can be further expanded into combinations of other non-terminals until they produce terminals ('t' followed by numbers). Each production is a combination of two non-terminals, conforming to Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nSince the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, the parsing process should follow a specific structure, and the string can be checked for validity by attempting to parse it step by step.\n\nI'll start by breaking the string into tokens:\n\nt20, t20, t9, t48, t17, t37, t29, t27, t23, t37, t15, t21, t45, t60, t6, t47, t25, t27, t18, t30, t30, t21, t37, t2, t30, t9, t37, t60, t1, t8, t8, t32, t34, t28, t19, t26, t56, t29, t19, t44, t17.\n\nEach non-terminal in the grammar expands into combinations of two other non-terminals. For example, S -> NT88 NT26, and NT26 -> NT68 NT13, and so on. Each rule ultimately reduces to a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can simulate a bottom-up parsing or top-down parsing. Since the grammar is quite complex, perhaps I should look for the rules that produce each token, starting from the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the start symbol derived step by step. But given the number of tokens, it's best to think in terms of how the grammar can produce sequences of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, which is NT88 NT26. Each of these non-terminals (NT88 and NT26) must ultimately produce a string of terminals.\n\nLet's look at each part:\n\nNT88: The rule for NT88 is NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Wait, no, NT88 is actually defined as NT88 -> NT83 NT32. Because in the grammar, I see NT88 -> NT83 NT32. So each NT88 is two parts: NT83 and NT32.\n\nWait, no, let me recheck the given grammar rules. Wait, the provided grammar is in a list, so perhaps I should list out the relevant rules for each non-terminal that appear in the string.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I'm interested in the rules that produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT7 -> t2 (from NT7 -> NT11 NT22, and NT11 -> t4, NT22 -> t6, so NT7 -> t4 t6 = t46, but wait, no: NT22 is 't22' as 't22' is directly a terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check which rules produce terminal symbols and which produce non-terminals.

But given the length of the string, it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for each occurrence of 't' in the string and see if they can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nLet's start with the first token: t20. Looking at the grammar rules, I need to find which non-terminals produce 't20'. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> t6\n- NT20 -> t34\nBut where is 't20'? Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see any rules that produce 't20' directly. Wait, perhaps it's produced indirectly.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT17 -> t8, which is 't8', not 't20'. Another rule: NT22 -> t23, but in the string, I have a 't23' in token 9. Wait, no, 't37' is token 3, 't29' is token7, etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't20', perhaps it's produced by NT40: NT40 -> t6, but no.

{"custom_id":"request-718","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with multiple productions, and the string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has some specific characteristics: each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is useful because it constrains the grammar, making it easier to handle in some parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nThe given grammar has both non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are all the strings that look like \"t\" followed by a number, such as 't54', 't48', etc. The non-terminals are the ones on the left side of the arrows, like S, NT63, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t48 t45 t1 t9 t25 t45 t9 t28 t9 t21 t32 t55 t27 t11 t44 t16 t18 t27 t11 t60 t56 t4 t18 t57 t55 t8 t49 t57 t23 t44 t30 t27 t57 t54 t52 t56 t12 t47 t54 t37 t32`.\n\nI need to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two other symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal. But in this case, looking at the grammar, all the productions either have two non-terminals or in some cases, some have terminals, but in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar includes productions like S -> NT88 NT26. So S is replaced by two non-terminals. Then NT88 is replaced by, for example, NT8 and 32 (since NT88 is on RHS of S's production, I think the rule would have to be NT88 -> something... Wait, looking back, the productions seem to include ones like NT88 -> NT8 and 32? Or is it that the NT's have their own productions?\n\nWait, actually, the grammar seems to have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT88 -> NT8 and 32. Wait, no, looking more carefully: the productions might be more complex. Let's check a few:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- And so on.\n\nLooking at these, it seems that each production for a non-terminal (NT) results in two non-terminals. Wait, but some productions after 66 have 't' as the right-hand side. For example:\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58\n- ... and then there's a production like NT7 -> 't2', meaning a terminal.\n\nWait, so actually, some of the productions for the NTs have terminals as part of their RHS. But in CNF, all productions must have exactly two symbols, either both non-terminals or at least one being a terminal. So, in this case, the grammar might not strictly be in CNF because some productions have more than two symbols. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, but the grammar is supposed to be in CNF.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to step back and try to parse the string using the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each 'tX' must be matched by a production that eventually breaks down into the terminals. The plan is to check if the string can be split into a series of productions, each contributing exactly two symbols, until all symbols are resolved into terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe a better approach is to try to find a derivation path from S to the given string. Let me attempt to split the string into factors that might match the RHS of some productions.\n\nFirst, look for the start symbol, S, which starts the derivation. So S produces two non-terminals, say X and Y, so the first two symbols in the string should be X and Y, which are terminals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in a CNF grammar, each production is of the form A -> BC, where B and C are non-terminals. So every step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach leaves that are terminals. But in this case, our string is a sequence of terminals. So the derivation would consist of starting from S, replacing it with two non-terminals, then replacing some of those, etc., until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some productions have two non-terminals, others have a mix, or perhaps some have two terminals and a non-terminal, but wait no\u2014Wait, in a CNF grammar, each production must be A -> B C or A -> a, where a is a single terminal symbol. So in this grammar, all RHSs must have exactly two elements, either two non-terminals or one non-terminal and some terminal?\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the RHS. So if a production is A->a B, that's fine, but any production with more than two would violate CNF. Looking at the grammar, let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see for example:\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18: that's two non-terminals, which is allowed.\n\nNT98 -> NT41 NT40: okay.\n\nBut then, for example, NT48 also has NT59 NT98: okay, two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but some of the productions for the NTs on the right-hand side of other rules seem to have two non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar is correctly in CNF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting, but regardless, I can proceed.\n\nThe given string is 39 tokens long. Each token is a terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nWait, to form the string, the string must be the concatenation of the terminals from left to right.\n\nIn the context of a CNF grammar, the string can be viewed as a binary tree where each split is according to the productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite extensive, I'll try to find a possible way to split the given string into a series of two-terminals, each corresponding to the RHS of a production.\n\nLet me try to build a possible parse.\n\nThe string starts with 't54 t48 t45 t1 ...'\n\nLet's see if 't54' can come from some production. Looking in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for non-terminals that have a production ending with 't54'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I can see:\n\nHmm, I need to go through the grammar and find where terminals appear as the right-hand side of productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT58 -> NT11 NT4 and NT37 NT32\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, a few productions have a terminal.\n\nFor example, looking for 't' followed by something:\n\n- NT48 -> 't2' is not a terminal, it's NT48 -> 't2'?\n\nWait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me go through each production and check for terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4 and another production for NT58 is NT58 -> 't28' NT?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking again, let's go through the productions one by one:\n\nStarting from NT63: NT63 -> NT48 NT87 (non-terminals)\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13 (nt)\n\nNT41 -> NT77 NT18 (nt)\n\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58 (nt)\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79 (nt)\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22 (nt)\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22 (nt)\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83 (nt)\n\nNT51 -> NT70 NT94 (nt)\n\nNT13 -> NT7 NT69 (nt)\n\nNT2 -> NT87 NT70 (nt)\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4 (nt; NT33 is NT, 4 is a terminal?)\n\nWait, 4 is a terminal, but in this case, '4' is written as a string 'NT4', which is a non-terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT4 is a non-terminal, but perhaps sometimes it's represented as a terminal?\n\nWait, no\u2014 in the grammar, the terminals are the ones that are written with 't' followed by a number, like '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The start symbol is S, and the given string is a series of terminals, so it needs to be derived from S using the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t53 t15 t23 t21 t15 t56 t6 t33 t26 t2 t19 t34 t47 t15 t44 t19 t15 t20 t38 t39 t1 t55 t36 t32 t34 t1 t57 t25 t48 t54 t2 t4 t16 t20 t55 t47 t27 t28 t1 t47 t49 t53`.\n\nHmm, that's a long string. Each token like t53, t15, etc., is a terminal symbol. My approach should be to find a derivation starting from S, expanding non-terminals step by step until I get to the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must start with the rightmost symbols of NT88 and NT26. Let me check the string: the first token is t53, so I need to see how NT88 and NT26 can derive to sequences ending with t53 and whatever comes next.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production results in two non-terminals, so each step increases the number of non-terminals by one.

Similarly, NT11 can produce 't4' or 't17' or some others.\n\nBut going back to the string, the first part is t53, which suggests that in the derivation, the first symbols must come from NT53, which directly produces 't48'. Wait, but the string starts with t53, so in the derivation, NT53 must be expanded to 't53'. But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT53 has a production: `NT53 -> 't48'`. So that would mean NT53 can't produce 't53'\u2014it only produces 't48' as a terminal. So that's a problem because the string starts with t53.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Because in the grammar, if NT53 only produces 't48', then how can the string have 't53' as the first symbol? That suggests that the grammar can't produce a string starting with 't53' because NT53 can only go to 't48'. Unless there's a typo in the grammar, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me double-check: looking for NT53 in the production list. Yes, here it is:\n\n`NT53 -> 't48'`.\n\nSo, that's the only production for NT53. Therefore, the first symbol in the string should be 't48', but it's actually 't53'. That's a contradiction.

{"custom_id":"request-733","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar provided has a lot of rules, each of the form A -> BC, and some terminals (the 't' followed by numbers). The string I need to check is a series of these 't' tokens: `t33 t20 t44 t8 t8 t26 t48 t33 t34 t60 t8 t34 t38 t34 t45 t29 t26 t16 t44 t1 t23 t49 t30 t37 t55 t19 t21 t18 t52 t8 t2 t16 t48 t38 t28 t25 t39 t60 t47 t32 t39 t19 t30`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The left-hand side is a single non-terminal. This form is useful because it allows for easy parsing using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which is typically used to check if a string is generated by a CNF grammar.\n\nBut since I'm not going to implement the CYK algorithm here, maybe I can approach this differently. In CNF, every string that's generated must be a sequence of these terminals, and each production step can only handle two symbols at a time. So, the length of the string must be 2^n -1 for some n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nLooking at the string, its length is 40 tokens. Let's see if this could be a power of 2 minus 1. 2^5 -1 is 31, 2^6 -1 is 63. So 40 is between these, so that means the grammar cannot generate a string of 40 tokens unless it's exactly matching some structure, but 40 isn't a power of 2 minus 1. Wait, but wait, maybe I got that wrong. Actually, in CNF, the number of steps is n-1 for a string of length n. So for a string of length 40, n would be 41. Hmm, but 41 isn't a power of 2 minus 1 either. Wait, 2^5 is 32, so 40-1 is 39, which is not a power of 2. So the string length doesn't fit the structure where each step is combining two symbols, so it's likely that the string is either too long or too short. Wait, let's count the number of symbols in the string.\n\nWait the given string is a sequence separated by spaces: `t33 t20 t44 t8 t8 t26 t48 t33 t34 t60 t8 t34 t38 t34 t45 t29 t26 t16 t44 t1 t23 t49 t30 t37 t55 t19 t21 t18 t52 t8 t2 t16 t48 t38 t28 t25 t39 t60 t47 t32 t39 t19 t30`. Let's count them: 40 tokens. So 40 is 2^5 -1 =31, 2^6-1=63. So 40 isn't 2^n-1, meaning the string can't be derived in the grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check the grammar rules again. The initial grammar starts with S -> NT88 NT26. Each rule is two non-terminals. So each step would double the number of symbols on the stack, I think. So the parse tree would have depth related to the length of the string.\n\nWait, another approach: in CNF each production applies to two symbols, replacing them with two symbols, which can eventually produce a terminal. But for a string of length n, the number of symbols must be 2^k for some k. So a string of length 40 means that 40 is not a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So 40 is not a power of two, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the string starts with 't33', which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals do produce terminals. For example, NT48 -> t27, NT7 -> t2, etc. So the bottom of the parse tree would have terminals, which are the 't' strings. But each step would combine non-terminals into two non-terminals, until the base case is reached, which would be a terminal.\n\nSo for a string of length m, the number of symbols (considering the initial symbols as 2, and each step potentially increasing or decreasing the count?). Wait, actually, in CNF, the derivation starts with a single non-terminal (the start symbol S). Each production replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals. So each step increases the number of symbols on the stack by one. So the length of the string generated is the number of terminals, which is the number of symbols in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of productions. Starting from S, each step can replace one non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each replacement increases the count by one. To get a string, you have to stop when all non-terminals are replaced by terminals. So the initial S is one symbol. After one replacement, it's two symbols. After two replacements, each of those two could be non-terminals, so replacing one gives two symbols, making total three. Or maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the string is equal to the number of terminals, which would be equal to the number of leaves in the parse tree. For a string of length m, the number of nodes in the parse tree would be m, and the number of internal nodes would be m-1. Since each internal node corresponds to a production, the depth of the tree would be log2(m+1). But for this, m+1 must be a power of two. Because each production splits a non-terminal into two, so the number of leaves is 2^k for some k.\n\nWait, so if the string length is m, then m+1 must be a power of two. For example, length 1: 2^1 -1=1, yes. Length 3: 2^2-1=3. Length 7: 2^3-1=7, etc. So for the string given, m=40, so m+1=41. 41 is not a power of two (since 2^5=32, 2^6=64). Therefore, 41 is not a power of two, so the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-727","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The grammar rules are provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of tokens starting with 't's and some digits. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. In this case, the grammar seems to use both non-terminals (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) and terminals (the 't's and number tokens). But wait, looking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some that have a terminal and a non-terminal. That makes sense because in CNF, each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe task is to determine whether the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens: multiple 't's followed by numbers, and several 't's again. The string length is 43 tokens long. That's quite long, so I need an efficient way to check this without building a parse tree manually, but maybe I can find a pattern or use some properties of the grammar.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar rules. Some of the non-terminals have rules that produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal, like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22. Others have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT88 NT26. But the string we're evaluating has a long sequence of 't's and numbers, so I need to see if these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of word derivation from the grammar. Each production in CNF either adds one terminal or two non-terminals at each step. So, the number of symbols in the string (derived from non-terminals and terminals) has to match the grammar's possible expansion. \n\nWait, the initial symbol is S, which produces NT88 and NT26. So any derivation will start with two non-terminals. Then each of those non-terminals will eventually derive into either a terminal or another pair of non-terminals, depending on the rules.\n\nHmm, but for the string provided, the first few tokens are 't37 t53 t60', which are all terminals. So I need to see if these can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Let me check the production rules where 't's appear. I see rules like NT7 \u2192 't2', NT90 \u2192 't56', etc. So each of these terminals is the result of a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to track how each 't' in the string can be traced back through the grammar's productions. Maybe I can reverse-engineer the process. For instance, the last token in the string is 't37, which is produced by some rule. Looking at the grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. Wait, no, NT48 can also produce 't27 and maybe other things. Wait, in the grammar provided, I see some 't's are directly produced by NT rules. For example, NT7 \u2192 't2' and NT70 \u2192 't11', etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into segments corresponding to the different non-terminals. Each non-terminal has a fixed set of ways it can expand into others or terminals. So starting from S, we expand into NT88 and NT26. Then each of these needs to expand further until they either become terminals or more non-terminals. But building this out for 43 tokens seems tedious.\n\nMaybe I can think in terms of the parse tree depth. S is the start symbol, so each expansion step adds depth to the tree. Since each production either adds a non-terminal or two, the total number of nodes must relate to the number of leaves in the parse tree. However, it's not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the grammar's language structure. The string is a sequence of 't's interleaved with numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific non-terminal production. Perhaps I can map each number in the string to a non-terminal that can produce that number. For example, if the string has 't37', I need to find which non-terminal's production includes 't37' as one of its terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that certain non-terminals produce specific 't's. For instance, NT7 \u2192 't2', NT90 \u2192 't56', NT50 \u2192 't38', and so on. So each number in the string should correspond to a production that includes that 't' as one of the terminals.\n\nBut wait, some productions produce two terminals, like NT48 \u2192 't2' and 't18'. So if a non-terminal is derived into, it can contribute two 't's in succession. Therefore, the string must be a concatenation of such terminal pairs, but also considering that some non-terminals are part of larger expansions.\n\nWait, no. Each production of a non-terminal can only produce either one terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation adds either one terminal or two non-terminals to the left-hand side of the string.\n\nBut since the string consists of only terminals, the non-terminals in the derivation must eventually be expanded into terminals. So, the overall process is that each non-terminal in the derivation must have a production that leads to terminals. So, for example, a non-terminal NT48 can expand into 't2' and 't18', which are both terminals, so that's a possible way to produce a two-token string from that non-terminal.\n\nBut our given string is a single sequence of tokens, so each non-terminal's derivation must terminate in a series of terminal expansions.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I can try to see if the string can be derived step by step. However, given the string's length and the number of possible non-terminal branches, that would take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the structure of the grammar and see if any parts can only produce certain patterns. For instance, some non-terminals have productions that produce certain terminals, and the string must conform to these.\n\nWait, here's an idea: let me try to look for the production rules in the grammar where a non-terminal is connected to 't's and see if I can build the string backward. Starting from the end of the string, I can see if each terminal can come from a specific production.\n\nLet's take the last token: 't37. I need to find a production where 't37' is one of the terminals. Looking through the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't2', NT48 \u2192 't27' according to one rule, and NT72 \u2192 't44' in another. Hmm, but wait, looking through the provided rules, I see NT40 \u2192 't6', NT48 \u2192 't27' in more than one rule, and other 't's. However, nowhere do I see 't37' directly. That's strange because the string ends with 't37', so if the last non-terminal used a production that only produces 't37', then the string would end there. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't37. So perhaps that's an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me carefully check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't60', 't6', etc. Wait, no 't37'.\n- NT47 \u2192 't47'? I don't see any 't37'.\n\nHmm, so if the string ends with 't37', but there's no production that produces 't37', then that token is invalid, meaning the entire string cannot be derived from the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar provided. The user provided a long list of NT rules, and in fact, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly expands into 't37'. All the 't's present are specific to certain non-terminals, but 't37' isn't listed as a terminal in any production. Therefore, that token can't be part of the language generated by this grammar.\n\nThat's a crucial point. If one of the tokens in the string is 't37' and there's no production rule in the grammar that allows a non-terminal to produce 't37' directly, then the string isn't in the language. Moreover, there's no way 't37' can be derived as part of a two-terminal expansion either, because the only two-terminal expansions are combinations like 't2' 't18', 't53' 't48', etc., none of which include 't37'.\n\nSo, the presence of 't37' at the end of the string makes it impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because there's no rule that produces 't37'.

{"custom_id":"request-740","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two on the right, or a terminal. Wait, no, actually, CNF can be either both non-terminals or a terminal, but in this case, looking at the rules, some produce terminals directly in the last step. So, I think the productions are set up so that each non-terminal expands into two symbols, either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal, or two terminals if needed. But in this grammar, many rules directly produce a terminal symbol, which might simplify things.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of t's and numbers, which might correspond to terminal symbols. Let's list them out: t26, t19, t18, t8, t8, t60, t23, t44, t34, t48, t60, t27, t6, t57, t45, t33, t4, t45, t11, t19, t47, t6, t39, t48, t1, t2, t39, t20, t32, t45, t49, t52, t57, t18, t8, t26, t47, t16, t39, t38, t27, t16, t52, t16.\n\nI notice that each t followed by a number is a terminal, while letters like S, NT, etc., are non-terminals. The goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which according to the initial rule, S -> NT88 NT26. That means S expands into two parts: NT88 and NT26. Both must be expanded and concatenated.\n\nLet me see what each of these non-terminals produces. NT88 -> NT48 NT87, and NT26 -> NT68 NT13. Wait, but in the grammar provided, NT26 -> NT68 NT13. However, in the string, I see t26. Let me check if any non-terminal reduces to t26. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see NT26 -> t26. Instead, it continues further. So perhaps t26 is part of a larger reduction.\n\nWait, looking again, the string has t26, which is the third t in the string. Let me map the string into indices for better understanding:\n\n1. t26\n\n2. t19\n\n3. t18\n\n4. t8\n\n5. t8\n\n6. t60\n\n7. t23\n\n8. t44\n\n9. t34\n\n10. t48\n\n11. t60\n\n12. t27\n\n13. t6\n\n14. t57\n\n15. t45\n\n16. t33\n\n17. t4\n\n18. t45\n\n19. t11\n\n20. t19\n\n21. t47\n\n22. t6\n\n23. t39\n\n24. t48\n\n25. t1\n\n26. t2\n\n27. t39\n\n28. t20\n\n29. t32\n\n30. t45\n\n31. t49\n\n32. t52\n\n33. t57\n\n34. t18\n\n35. t8\n\n36. t26\n\n37. t47\n\n38. t16\n\n39. t39\n\n40. t38\n\n41. t27\n\n42. t16\n\n43. t52\n\n44. t16\n\nWait, that's 44 symbols. So each non-terminal in the grammar will contribute parts of this string. Let me map the entire process step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT88 NT26. So, the string must be built as NT88's expansion followed by NT26's expansion.\n\nNT88: according to the rules, NT88 -> NT48 NT87.\n\nSo NT88 expands into NT48 and NT87, which then each need to be expanded.\n\nNT48: NT48 could go to several places. Looking at the rules, for example, NT48 -> NT2 NT18.\n\nWait, but let me list all the rules:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT88: NT48 NT87\n\n- NT48 has multiple rules:\n  - NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n  - NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n  - NT48 -> NT7 NT58\n  - NT48 -> NT28 NT22\n  (and maybe others)\n\nWait, but let me find if any of the non-terminals collapse to t or specific t-s.\n\nWait, the string has \"t26\" as the first symbol. So, the initial expansion starts with S = NT88 NT26. So, looking at NT88, it expands into NT48 NT87. So first part is NT88, which goes to NT48 NT87.\n\nThen, NT26 expands into NT68 NT13.\n\nSo, S becomes (NT48 NT87) (NT68 NT13) -> when expanded, this will be NT48 NT87 NT68 NT13.\n\nBut the string starts with t26, which is part of what NT26 expands into. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, S is NT88 NT26. So, to produce the string, we have to expand NT88 and NT26 separately and then concatenate them.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nFirst, NT88:\n\nNT88 -> NT48 NT87. Let's expand NT48 and NT87.\n\nNT48: options are:\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n\n- NT48 -> NT7 NT58\n\n- NT48 -> NT28 NT22\n\n- (Are there more rules?)\n\nLooking back, yes, NT48 has more rules:\n\n- NT48 -> NT28 NT22 (as per the given rules)\n\n- Also, in the rules, NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and others.\n\nSo, perhaps NT48 can't produce t26 directly. Let me check NT26's expansion.\n\nNT26: rules:\n\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\n- Also, looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NT26 directly expands to a terminal. So that would go further.\n\nNT68: NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54: according to the rules, NT54 -> NT16 (t16) and NT13.\n\nSo NT68 becomes NT54 NT28.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the given rules:\n\n- NT54 -> NT16 NT13\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe rules are like this, for example:\n\nNT54 -> NT16 NT13\n\nNT28 -> NT56 NT22\n\nSo, expanding NT68: NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 becomes NT16 NT13.\n\nNT28 becomes NT56 NT22.\n\nSo, putting it all together, NT68 -> NT54 NT28 -> (NT16 NT13) (NT56 NT22) -> when fully expanded, including NT16 and NT13.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t26, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The production rules for S is NT88 NT26. So the string generated by S is the concatenation of what NT88 produces and what NT26 produces.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t26. Let's see if any path can produce t26 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the end, using a stack-based approach or recursive descent, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, I can try to see if each symbol in the string can be matched by a production.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to work backward from the string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, the string starts with t26. Let me check which non-terminal could produce t26 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly expands to t26. So t26 must come from a rule like NT26 -> ... and so the first symbol t26 would come from the first token of the NT26 expansion.

Let's see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nNT88: The production for NT88 is NT8 \u2192 NT32 NT28, but looking up NT88, it's actually NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Wait, in the grammar, I notice that NT88 is a non-terminal, but looking at the productions, it's not directly replaced. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me check the list again. scrolling through... Ah, yes, under NT22, the production is NT22 \u2192 NT11 NT33, and under NT35, NT35 \u2192 NT44 NT55. Wait, maybe I need to check the non-terminals in order.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a more systematic approach.

Wait, perhaps some non-terminals produce only terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t2, but NT7 isn't a terminal. Wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal. For example, looking at the productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t2\n\nYes, NT7 can produce 't2'. Similarly, I see NT11 \u2192 t4, and others. Let's list out all non-terminals that produce a single terminal:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t2\n\nNT11 \u2192 t4\n\nNT17 \u2192 t29\n\nNT18 \u2192 t47?\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nNT18 \u2192 t47?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 t47, yes.\n\nWait, also, other productions:\n\nWait, looking through, for example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t32\n\nWait, no, that's not present.

Because 't2' (from NT91) and 't33' (from NT33) would combine to 't23'?

{"custom_id":"request-746","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is: \n\nt52 t53 t21 t23 t17 t34 t8 t49 t15 t32 t11 t53 t6 t26 t27 t20 t4 t44 t47 t19 t12 t11 t56 t2 t11 t38 t48 t38 t60 t48 t17 t11 t57 t16 t32 t8 t23 t12 t19 t28 t4 t25 t44 t21 t17.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have production rules where each non-terminal (on the left side) produces exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the first step is to look at each production rule and see if the given string can follow that structure, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26 according to the rule S -> NT88 NT26. So the string generated by S should break down into two parts: one starting with NT88 and the other with NT26.\n\nBut the given string starts with t52, which is a terminal symbol, so I need to check the production rules that produce t52. Scanning through the provided rules, I see that NT58 -> t56, but that's not helpful. Wait, looking again, I spot NT55 -> t8, but t52 is another terminal. I need to find what produces t52.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT77 -> NT33 NT79 and NT77 is connected to t6 via NT59 -> t15? Wait, maybe I should list all the production rules that result in terminals so I can see the possible sequences.\n\nActually, perhaps a better approach is to construct the parse tree from the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is two symbols. So the string should have a length that's a power of two plus one minus one? Or wait, for a CFG in Chomsky normal form, the string length must be 2^n where n is the number of applications. Wait, no, because each step replaces a symbol with two symbols. The initial symbol S can generate a string of length up to 2^(n) where n is the number of steps.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about whether each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal using the rules, and whether the structure builds correctly.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t52. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t52. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT14 -> NT66 NT90, etc.\nWait, find a production that results in t52. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't27' (so t27 is NT73)\n- NT53 -> 't48' (t48 is NT53)\n- NT83 -> 't52' (so t52 is NT83)\n- NT73 -> 't27' (not relevant)\nWait, let's check each NT rule that ends with a terminal:\n\n- NT73 -> 't27' (so t27 is NT73)\n- NT53 -> 't48' (t48 is NT53)\n- NT83 -> 't52' (so t52 is NT83)\n- NT73 -> 't27' (already mentioned)\nWait, perhaps I need to find which NT rules produce t52. It looks like NT83 -> t52. So the first symbol t52 corresponds to NT83.\n\nSo the first part is NT83, and according to the start rule, S produces NT88 and NT26. Hmm, wait, that suggests that the first part is NT88, but the first token is t52, which is NT83.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go back. The start symbol S produces NT88 and NT26 according to the production S -> NT88 NT26. So the derived string would be NT88 NT26, and each of those can further expand. But the string starts with t52, which suggests that in the parse tree, the leftmost symbol might have expanded into a chain that starts with NT83 (t52).\n\nWait, perhaps the leftmost derivation is not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the tree is structured such that some rule produces NT83, which then becomes t52. So let's start by breaking down the string step by step, trying to assign which NT it comes from.\n\nThe string is: t52 t53 t21 t23 t17 t34 t8 t49 t15 t32 t11 t53 t6 t26 t27 t20 t4 t44 t47 t19 t12 t11 t56 t2 t11 t38 t48 t38 t60 t48 t17 t11 t57 t16 t32 t8 t23 t12 t19 t28 t4 t25 t44 t21 t17.\n\nBreaking it down after t52: t53. So, t52 is NT83, which produces 't52' per rule NT83 -> t52.\n\nNext is t53, which is NT17. Because looking through the rules, NT17 has two rules: NT17 -> NT63 NT50 and NT17 -> t29. Wait, that's not right. Let me check the rules again for NT17. Actually, in the given rules, I see:\n\nLooking for 't53', which is a terminal symbol. Let's see which NT produces t53. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT -> t53. Hmm, I don't immediately see any NT rule that produces t53. Let me scan:\n\n- NT35 -> t44: no\n- NT77 -> t33: no\n- NT79 -> t22: no\n- Wait, perhaps I missed some. Let me look for all the symbols that end with a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should scan each rule to see which NTs result in terminals:\n\nLooking for each rule where the RHS is two terminals or one.\n\nI can see that some NTs produce terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> t36\n- NT4 -> t54\n- NT13 -> t12\n- NT18 -> t47\n- NT21 -> t34\n- NT23 -> t23 (but that's a terminal, so this rule produces a terminal followed by NT23's production)\nWait, no, NT23 is in the grammar. Let me check all NT rules that have a terminal on the RHS.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, many produce other non-terminals. The ones that produce terminals are where the RHS is a single terminal. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires that each production produces exactly two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals. So a production like NT17 -> t29 would be illegal in Chomsky normal form because it would produce a single terminal in one step. Wait, but looking at the initial grammar: S -> NT88 NT26, so it's two non-terminals. So all other productions are either two non-terminals or two terminals. Wait, no, in Chomsky normal form, productions can be A->BC, A->B, or A->a. Wait, actually, in the initial grammar, I see two terminals in a single production. Wait, no, all right-hand sides are two symbols, but they might be terminals or non-terminals. So, the grammar is in CNF because each production is two symbols.\n\nBut the key is that a production could produce a terminal or non-terminal. So for example, NT7 -> t59: no, wait, looking through:\n\nWait, I'm seeing that some NT rules produce terminals, while others produce two NTs. But to avoid ambiguity, I need to process the string step by step.\n\nSo, starting with t52, which is NT83. So the string after t52 is t53 t21 t23... So after processing NT83, the remaining string is the rest of the symbols except t52. But in a leftmost derivation, the first symbol to be expanded would be NT88. But this is not matching, because the first symbol is t52, implying that NT88 produced something that leads into t52. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is processed from left to right, assigning the first symbol to a non-terminal, expanding it until we reach t52.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a stack-based approach, as in an algorithm for parsing with a context-free grammar.\n\nLet me try to model this.

{"custom_id":"request-750","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by this grammar. The string is a series of symbols separated by spaces, and I need to determine if the grammar can generate this string.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that CNF has certain restrictions: each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, and no start symbols. The given grammar seems to fit that since every production rule is of the form X \u2192 YZ, where Y and Z are non-terminals, except for some cases where terminals are present, but actually, wait\u2014CNF allows terminals in the productions, but in the right-hand side, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. But in the provided grammar, I don't see any terminals on the left-hand side; every production seems to start with a non-terminal like S, NT63, etc. Hmm, maybe the terminals are only on the right-hand side. So the grammar might be in a restricted form where every production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, which is sometimes called a binary grammar allowing terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, many of the non-terminals on the left don't produce two non-terminals but a terminal or a non-terminal and a terminal. Wait, looking again: some rules like NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 have both non-terminals, others like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 have non-terminals, but others like NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68 have two non-terminals as well. Wait, actually, in the initial productions like S \u2192 NT88 NT26, both sides are non-terminals. So each production only includes non-terminals, but the right-hand side can be terms that eventually derive into terminals.\n\nSo the grammar allows for productions where the right-hand side is two non-terminals. Now, since the string consists of a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, like 't49', 't39', etc., these are likely terminals, as in the given rules, certain non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nThe string to check is \"t49 t39 t9 t18 t4 t20 t57 t16 t12 t20 t57 t29 t6 t56 t52 t8 t29 t47 t16 t60 t60 t38 t29 t12 t55 t49 t15 t30 t39 t39 t12 t18 t8 t32 t53 t20 t49 t45 t34 t19 t11 t54 t56 t20 t16\". \n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if there's a derivation that can produce exactly this sequence of terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will generate the string in a certain way. Alternatively, perhaps a recursive descent approach would work, but given the complexity, maybe I should look for a way to parse the string with the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of symbols and check if each symbol can be derived by the non-terminals in the grammar. Each non-terminal can be replaced by two other non-terminals or a terminal. Since the grammar is provided with all productions, perhaps I can use a top-down approach or a parser.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step, replacing the leftmost non-terminal with its right-hand side each time, checking if the string can be fully reduced to the start symbol S, but since the string is given, I need to see if it can be broken down into the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nBut given the string's length and the complexity, maybe it's manageable.\n\nLet me list out all the symbols in the string in order: \n\nt49, t39, t9, t18, t4, t20, t57, t16, t12, t20, t57, t29, t6, t56, t52, t8, t29, t47, t16, t60, t60, t38, t29, t12, t55, t49, t15, t30, t39, t39, t12, t18, t8, t32, t53, t20, t49, t45, t34, t19, t11, t54, t56, t20, t16.\n\nThat's 54 symbols. \n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production for S is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the string must be derived starting from NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me check the first symbols under NT88 and NT26.\n\nThe first symbol is t49. So, perhaps NT88 \u2192 ... and the first element of its expansion is t49.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNow, NT8: Let's check the production for NT8. Looking through the given rules, I don't see NT8 directly, but wait, let me scan the provided rules. Let's look for any NT8, but I don't see it in the initial ones. Then further, after NT55 comes NT18, and later NT8 appears.\n\nWait, in the given rules: wait, perhaps I need to list all the rules, but since it's a lot, maybe a better approach is to check for each terminal whether it's directly produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, each terminal is present as a production (e.g., NT72 \u2192 't44'). So let me check which non-terminals produce 't49'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT49: Not listed as a right-hand side; wait, looking at the given rules, I see NT49 isn't there. Wait, in the rules, the right-hand side has NT49: no, let's check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note all the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals.\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't44'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT11 \u2192 't4' and 't21', etc.\n\nLooking for each terminal symbol:\n\nt49: Checking the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal is replaced by t49.\n\nSimilarly, t39: Checking rules: NT39 \u2192 't15'? Wait, looking through the provided rules: Wait, no, looking for 't39':\n\nWait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules I have, several production rules have a single terminals on the RHS, like:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't27'\n- NT32 \u2192 't1'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT70 \u2192 't17' etc.\n\nWait, but the string contains 't49', 't39', etc. Let me check if any non-terminal immediately produces 't49' or 't39'.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I can see:\n\nLooking through each rule, let's list the terminals and their corresponding non-terminals:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't44'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't2' (Wait, no: Let me check. The first rules are S \u2192 NT88 NT26, then NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, etc.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't49', 't39', etc. For example, in the provided rules, 't49' appears as a production in NT49 being used. Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nLooking for 't49' as a RHS:\n\n- NT49 is not a terminal; actually, the rules don't have a production where a non-terminal is replaced by 't49'. So perhaps it's not possible because none of the non-terminals directly produce 't49'. That might already imply the answer is 'No'. But let me check all 't's in the string.\n\nLooking at the symbols:\n\nFirst, t49: Is there any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t49?

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to have a mix of both non-terminals and terminals, but I need to make sure whether terminals are only single characters or multi-character symbols. Wait, in CNF, terminals are single symbols, so in this case, the terminals look like two-letter abbreviations. For example, 't47' is a terminal symbol. So I'll note that.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t47 t4 t48 t20 t39 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t60 t20 t8 t38 t57 t17 t26 t27 t53 t48 t28 t25 t34 t39 t33 t25 t36 t34 t56 t4 t21`.\n\nWait, some of these might be multi-character, but in the grammar, most look like single letters. Wait, looking back, the grammar symbols have a mix; some look like two-character, like 't4' or 't6'. But in the grammar productions, for example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, where NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals represented by capital N's followed by numbers. Wait, some of these look like terminals? Or perhaps in the grammar, numbers are part of the non-terminals, but each production has two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So for example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which suggests that NT88 is a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the string, we have two-character symbols like 't47', 't33', etc. So I think each two-character starts with a 't' followed by numbers, and these are terminals because the grammar's productions include single-letter terminals like 't27' in one rule (NT76 \u2192 t55, I guess\u2014Wait, in one rule, NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68, and NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, so on. Wait, no, the grammar includes terminals like 't2' and 't56' etc. So I think each 'tXX' where XX is a number is a terminal.\n\nSo in the string, each token is either a two-letter starting with 't' (like t47) or some single letters. Wait, no. Looking back, the string is: `t47 t4 t48 t20 t39 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t60 t20 t8 t38 t57 t17 t26 t27 t53 t48 t28 t25 t34 t39 t33 t25 t36 t34 t56 t4 t21`.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t47`, which is two characters, 't' and '4', '7'. Then `t4` is 't', '4'. But in the grammar, we have productions like NT22 \u2192 NT66 NT56, but the grammar also includes some rules where non-terminals seem to have numbers as suffixes, like NT41 -> NT77 NT18. Wait, actually, upon closer inspection, in the grammar, it's structured as N T X, like NT88, which is a non-terminal. So, when parsing a string, each symbol in the string is either a non-terminal (NT***) or a terminal (t**). So, in the string, two-character tokens like 't47', 't56', etc., are terminals because they start with 't' and have numbers. The single letters, like 't4', are also terminals. However, some are single letters and the others are two-character. So, I need to parse each token as a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps every token is a terminal because in the grammar, all the right-hand sides consist of non-terminals, and the string is made of such tokens.\n\nBut to parse the string, we'd need a top-down parser like the CYK algorithm, which works for CNF grammars. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Therefore, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). The process must match the entire string starting from S.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, which is 78 tokens, it's quite long, and manually applying a parsing algorithm would be time-consuming. So, perhaps I can look for a pattern or see if the string can be broken down using the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first step is to note that each production in the grammar is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a non-terminal to two terminals. Because in the given grammar, for example, NT85 -> NT17 NT58, which are both non-terminals, but also cases like NT58 -> t25, which is a terminal. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I think all the leaves are terminals, as they eventually reduce to 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nSo, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. Wait, in the given grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S is a non-terminal, and both NT88 and NT26 are also non-terminals. So as we go deeper into the productions, deeper non-terminals are broken into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to model the derivation as a tree, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use memoization or dynamic programming with the CYK algorithm, but given the string's length, that would be tedious.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can look for patterns in the string and see if they can be broken down using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string: `t47 t4 t48 t20 t39 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t54 t2 t33 t15 t18 t15 t4 t56 t57 t60 t20 t8 t38 t57 t17 t26 t27 t53 t48 t28 t25 t34 t39 t33 t25 t36 t34 t56 t4 t21`.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t47. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals derive to t47? Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT55 -> t55 (Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, the rules include NT55 \u2192 t52, NT55 \u2192 t54, NT55 \u2192 t55?

{"custom_id":"request-763","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars are defined in Chomsky normal form, which typically has each production rule where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals. I remember that the grammar can be used with a parsing algorithm like the CYK algorithm, or maybe a recursive descent parser, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the LHS symbols are all followed by a number, like S -> NT88 NT26. Wait, actually in the grammar, it's S -> NT88 NT26, which is a bit unusual because usually CNF has each rule as one non-terminal producing two others. So maybe that's a typo, but regardless, the structure seems to fit as each production has two parts.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t26, t30, t56, etc. My goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and seeing if I can break it down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with t26. I need to see if any production directly ends with t26 or if there are multiple steps. Looking through the grammar, I see that some productions end with t26. For example, NT22 -> t44, but that's not helpful. Wait, the grammar has several 't' symbols with numbers that might correspond to terminals in the string.\n\nWait, some productions have 't' followed by a number, which probably correspond to specific terminal symbols in the string. For example, NT22 -> t44, which would match if the string has t44 somewhere. But in our string, the initial part is t26, so maybe I should look for productions that can eventually produce t26.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see NT72 -> t32. So if I have NT72, it can produce t32. Another production is NT42 -> t18 and NT18 -> t47. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning. The string is: t26 t30 t56 t47 t8 t56 t23 t25 t53 t48 t32 t2 t54 t12 t9 t54 t57 t52 t38 t19 t36 t19 t15 t27 t9 t56 t17 t6 t26 t60 t20 t45 t9 t17 t57 t21 t36 t4 t47 t60 t28 t12 t45 t53 t27 t26.\n\nThat's quite long. Maybe I can look for the start symbol S and see which productions it can derive from. The start symbol is S in the grammar, and the rule for S is S -> NT88 NT26. So S produces two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Both of these are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT88's productions, it's in the rule NT88 -> NT8 -> 't8'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT88 is actually a non-terminal that has a production NT88 -> NT8 -> which seems to go to another non-terminal, which might derive t8. Wait, but in the grammar, NT88 is a non-terminal, and the rule is NT88 -> NT8 -> which is incomplete. Wait, no, looking again, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, each line is a production rule. So S -> NT88 NT26 means that S can produce two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. Then, NT88 has a production NT88 -> NT8 -> which is another non-terminal. Wait, no, that's not right. Each rule is written as LHS -> RHS. So for example, NT88 -> NT8. So NT88 expands to NT8.\n\nWait, but NT8 is a non-terminal, and from the grammar, NT8 has a production in another rule: NT8 -> 't8'. So NT8 produces a terminal t8. So putting that together, S can be expanded as NT88 followed by NT26. NT88 expands to NT8, which then produces t8. NT26 expands to something else. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT26's productions: NT26 -> NT68 NT13. So NT26 becomes NT68 and NT13. NT68 has a production NT68 -> NT54 NT28. NT54 is a non-terminal, and its production is NT54 -> NT56. NT56 is a non-terminal that can produce t6. NT28 is a non-terminal that has production NT28 -> t56. So putting NT68 together: NT68 -> NT54 NT28 -> t56 t56? Wait, that's confusing. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to reconstruct the derivation steps.\n\nStarting from S, S -> NT88 NT26. NT88 -> NT8, which gives t8. NT26 -> NT68 NT13. Then, NT68 -> NT54 NT28. NT54 -> NT56. NT56 -> t6. NT28 -> t56.\n\nWait, so if I follow that, S would derive t8 t56, but that doesn't match the beginning of the string, which is t26.\n\nHmm, so that's a problem. Maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me double-check: the production S -> NT88 NT26. Then NT88 is a non-terminal that only expands to NT8. Then NT8 expands to t8, so the entire S production from S splits into NT88 (which becomes t8) and NT26 (which I need to see what it becomes).\n\nWait, so S -> NT88 NT26 would generate t8 followed by something from NT26. So the string S would produce starts with t8, but the given string starts with t26. So that implies that t8 is not at the beginning of the string, but that's the case. Therefore, S cannot be the start symbol if the string starts with t26. That suggests a possible conflict.\n\nWait, but maybe my understanding of the grammar is incorrect. Let me look for NT26 in the grammar. Oh, wait, there's a rule NT26 -> 't26' somewhere. Looking through the productions, yes, I see: NT26 -> 't26'. Wait no, no, I think I'm confusing symbols. Let me scan the entire grammar list.\n\nWait, the grammar is a list of productions, each starting with a non-terminal symbol, and each line is something like NTxyz -> RHS.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that there are several cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, like NT8 -> 't8' or NT22 -> t22, wait, no.\n\nWait, let me list some of them to make sure:\n\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n\n- NT91 -> 't44'\n\nWait, looking for 't26'... Hmm, I see a production later: NT26 -> t26? Or does it go to something else?\n\nWait, I see near the bottom of the grammar:\n\nNT22 -> 't44', NT75 -> 't60', NT28 -> 't56', NT17 -> 't29', NT18 -> 't47', etc.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I don't see NT26 directly leading to 't26', but I see NT26's productions: Looking back at the user's message, under NT50, there's NT75 -> 't60' and another production for NT28 -> 't56', but for NT26, in the grammar, do I see any production?\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, under NT26, looking through the list, yes: Wait, the user listed the grammar rules as:\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\nNT12 -> NT12\n... etc.\n\nWait, I don't see NT26 being directly mapped to a terminal in the given grammar. So the only production for NT26 is NT68 NT13. So then, if S starts with NT26, it would generate a longer string.\n\nWait, but S -> NT88 NT26, and both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-774","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and non-terminals or terminals on the right. Looking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules starting with NT followed by other NTs or numbers, which are terminals. Some of the rules like NT13 -> t53 are direct terminal assignments, where 't' stands for terminal and the number is the index of the terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, like t18 t49 t11 t6 t56 and so on. This pattern seems to match the terminal symbols in the grammar. My task is to determine if this string can be generated by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I think I need to analyze how the string is constructed. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so the derivation tree will be a binary tree. Each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two others, until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar has a lot of production rules, perhaps it's a complex one, and the string might be long. The string has several terms, so maybe it's generated by a series of productions that expand these NTs into terminals as per the rules.\n\nI should look for each 't' in the string and see if it's covered by the grammar's terminal rules. For example, t18 appears several times in the string. Looking at the grammar, I see NT18 -> t47. But wait, the string has t18 appearing as a terminal, so if NT18 can only produce t47, then how does t18 itself appear as a terminal symbol? That seems contradictory because NT18 is a non-terminal and would have to be expanded into something else, but according to the grammar, NT18 produces t47. So, that would mean t18 is t47? But that doesn't make sense because the same symbol would represent two different terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, I see: NT48 -> t27, and NT18 -> t44. So NT18 produces t44. But in the string, there is t18, which isn't in the grammar as a terminal. Wait, actually, the string has t18, t49, t53, etc., but looking at the grammar, some are non-terminals that map to terminals. For example, NT7 -> t2, NT17 -> t29, NT66 -> t30, etc. So perhaps t18 is a non-terminal that's been expanded or is used in a way that we need to derive.\n\nWait, no, t18 is a terminal in the string, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that defines t18 as a terminal. So NT18 in the grammar produces t44, but in the string, t18 appears as a terminal, which would be a problem unless NT18 can somehow produce t18 as a terminal, but I don't see that. So maybe that's a contradiction, meaning the string can't be generated because t18 as a terminal isn't in any production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT18 -> t47. So whenever you have NT18 in the derivation, it goes to t47. So in the string, t18 is a terminal, but it's not defined in the grammar as a terminal. Thus, that t18 cannot be generated by any rule because all rules either produce another NT or a terminal with a different number. Therefore, the string would contain a terminal symbol that the grammar doesn't support, meaning the string can't be generated.\n\nSo, t18 is problematic because it doesn't match any terminal production in the grammar. Therefore, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar to see all the productions. The start symbol is S, and the first rule is S -> NT88 NT26. That means the initial expansion starts with NT88 and NT26. Each of these is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded further until we reach terminal symbols. \n\nLooking at NT88 and NT26, I'll see their productions. From the grammar, I see NT88 -> NT8 NT32, and NT26 -> NT68 NT13. So after the first expansion, the string starts with NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13. \n\nI'll continue expanding these non-terminals. Let's break them down one by one:\n\n- NT8: Looking at the productions, NT8 -> NT47 NT29. So NT8 becomes NT47 NT29.\n- NT32: From the grammar, NT32 -> NT73 NT42. So NT32 expands to NT73 NT42.\n- NT68: NT68 -> NT54 NT28.

Let's do that:\n\n- NT47: The only production is NT47 -> t27, which is a terminal. So NT47 becomes 't27'.\n- NT29: NT29 doesn't seem to have a production in the given grammar that gives a terminal, but wait, let me check again. Looking through the provided productions, I don't see NT29 as a non-terminal that expands to a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the list carefully.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any production for NT29 except the one I already used (NT8 -> NT47 NT29). Wait, but in the grammar, NT29 is actually used as a terminal, but that's not possible because NT29 is a non-terminal. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial expansion, I had S -> NT88 NT26, which expanded to NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13. Then NT8 -> NT47 NT29. Now, looking for NT29 in the productions, I see that in the list under grammar, there's NT29 with some rules, but perhaps I need to check again. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any for NT29 besides the one from NT8. So maybe NT29 can't be expanded further. Wait, but that's impossible because in the given grammar, all non-terminals must have a production that leads to terminals eventually since it's in Chomsky Normal Form. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps NT29 is supposed to expand to something that eventually becomes a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT29 isn't a non-terminal anymore because it's only used in NT8's production. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let me look again. No, the production NT8 -> NT47 NT29 is correct. But in the given productions after NT8, the only rule is NT47 -> t27, so NT29 must have a production that eventually leads to a terminal. Wait, let me check if there's any NT29 in the productions. Looking through the list, I don't see NT29 being a non-terminal because all the productions for NT29 are actually the other way around. Wait, maybe NT29 is a non-terminal with a production that I missed. Let me scan the list again.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, the only mentions of NT29 are as a terminal in some productions.

The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t25 t23 t1 t52 t34 t32 t32 t9 t39 t8 t39 t38 t1 t36 t18 t27 t55 t8 t53 t26 t6 t52 t20 t32 t20 t36 t21 t21 t9 t44 t36 t15 t6 t52 t18 t21 t8 t25 t48 t11 t11 t26 t37 t54 t47 t30 t8 t53.\n\nI need to parse this string using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a method like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser. But maybe I can approach this more step-by-step.\n\nLet me look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string starts with 't37' which comes from NT88, and then 't20' from NT26. Wait, looking at the string, the first token is 't25', not 't37' or 't20'. That doesn't match up. So maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I should check the initial productions more carefully.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar again. The start symbol S produces NT88 and NT26. Looking at the productions, NT88 is defined as NT8 NT32, and NT26 is NT68 NT13.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 (NT8 NT32) (NT68 NT13).\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each rule has two non-terminals on the left. So S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and then NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nWait, let me list the productions to check how they expand. NT88 splits into NT8 and NT32. NT8 further splits into NT54 and NT29. Or wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT8: NT8 \u2192 NT54 NT29. NT54 is another non-terminal, but where is NT54 defined? Wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT54 is mentioned in the production NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90. Also, NT54 isn't explicitly defined as a terminal, so I think NT54 must be another non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some rules. Let me scan through the productions again.\n\nLooking through the rule list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT72 \u2192 NT23 NT23\n- So on. Wait, in NT50, I see NT50 \u2192 't53', which is a terminal. Similarly, other rules are either terminals or combinations of non-terminals.\n\nSo each non-terminal eventually produces one or more terminals and\/or non-terminals. The key is that each production in the grammar has exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for those that produce terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT7 \u2192 't2', a terminal.\n\nSo starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nNow, I need to continue expanding until leaves are all terminals. Let's see if the given string can be parsed in this way.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to check if the string length is correct. Since S produces two non-terminals, each production of those non-terminals will add two more tokens, and so on. So for example, each expansion step doubles the number of symbols, but since the grammar allows for some tokens to be terminals, maybe it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to attempt to parse the string step-by-step.\n\nWait, let me look at the first few tokens: t25, t23, t1, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, do any of the non-terminals produce 't25' or 't23'?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT72 \u2192 't23'\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\n- NT66 \u2192 't30'\n- NT20 \u2192 't51'\n- NT13 \u2192 't12'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- etc.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't25' or 't23' except for one rule: NT72 \u2192 t23. So in the string, the second token is 't23', which comes from NT72.\n\nSo maybe the start symbol S would expand into NT88 NT26, and NT26 would expand into, say, NT68 NT13. Then NT68 may produce something, and NT13 may produce t23 via another rule.\n\nBut looking back, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Now, looking at NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 isn't directly a terminal yet. Wait, looking further, perhaps other rules lead to terminals.\n\nWait, NT54 is mentioned in NT13: NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT40. Wait, that's from another part of the grammar. Let me go step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to reach 't25'. Looking through the rules, I see NT48 \u2192 't27', NT42 \u2192 't18', NT58 \u2192 't28', and NT48 appears in several rules as a non-terminal.\n\nWait, is there a non-terminal that directly expands to 't25'? Hmm, let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't25' except perhaps one I missed.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. Oh! NT28 \u2192 't56' and NT27 is from NT54 (I think). Wait, let me go to NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79. NT33 is a terminal? No, wait, looking through the rules, some non-terminals produce terminals:\n\nNT77 \u2192 't60' perhaps? Let me check. No, looking through:\n\nWait, I need to make a clearer list.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT11 \u2192 't4'\nNT17 \u2192 't29'\nNT2 \u2192 't36'\nNT91 \u2192 't44'\nNT18 \u2192 't47'\nNT23 \u2192 't23'  [From NT72 \u2192 t23]\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals directly producing 't25' except possibly in the last parts.\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT79 \u2192 't22 NT48' \u2192 't22' 't27' (since NT48 is 't27')\n- NT56 \u2192 NT17 and 't23' (from NT98)?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe the initial step is to check whether 't25' can be derived from any non-terminal. Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly expands to 't25' except perhaps from the last parts of the rules.\n\nWait, looking for where 't25' appears:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 't2' 't32'\n- NT48 also appears in other rules, but not directly as a terminal.\n\nSo, 't25' is a result of a non-terminal. Wait, looking through, perhaps the rule NT22 in the productions:\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't52'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\n- NT20 \u2192 't51'\n- NT22 \u2192 't44'\n- NT12 \u2192 't17'\n- NT22 appears in other places? Wait, looking at NT35 \u2192 't44'.\n\nWait, 't25' must come from a non-terminal that hasn't been listed as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to cross-check.\n\nWait, in the production rules, for NT28, it's 't56', and NT48 is 't27' from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. \n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the grammar and the string.

So, I'll need to reverse-engineer the string by tracing back how each terminal could have been derived from non-terminals.\n\nLet me break down the string into its tokens: t56, t32, t55, t11, t11, t37, t39, t12, t25, t36, t36, t47, t32, t11, t20, t44, t45, t54, t29, t34, t34, t11, t36, t53, t20, t37, t17, t17, t12, t49, t53, t20, t34, t54, t36, t55, t56, t2, t4, t20, t9, t44, t37, t6, t47, t52, t11, t17, t53.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26, the string must start with the terminals derived from NT88 and NT26. Let me check the productions for NT88 and NT26.\n\nFrom the given productions:\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo, after the first step, the string should start with the terminals of NT8 and NT32 from NT88, or NT68 and NT13 from NT26. The string starts with t56, which could be the terminal from NT88 or NT26. Let me check if t56 is a terminal under either.\n\nLooking at the NT88 productions, there's a production NT88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t56. So, NT8 produces t56. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 t56. Let me check if any non-terminals lead to t56.\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 NT54 NT28. Then NT54 \u2192 NT16 NT25, which leads to t55 via NT28 or something else. Wait, this might get complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string from the first symbol.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each non-terminal in the grammar branches into two parts, perhaps the entire string can be represented as a tree that starts from S and splits recursively. Given the length of the string, I can estimate the number of symbols. Let's see: the original S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the string generated would be a sequence of terminals expanded from these two non-terminals. Each step doubles the number of symbols until terminals are reached.\n\nSince the string has about 80 tokens, it's likely that the grammar would generate it if the tokens are a valid result of splitting and expanding from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice some patterns. For example, the string contains t56 twice: once at the beginning and once towards the end. Maybe it's part of a cycle in the grammar or the expanded tree.\n\nWait, checking the productions, I see NT56 is only produced by NT50, but looking through the other productions, I notice that several NTs lead to terminals via productions ending with 't'. For example, NT88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t56, so S starts by expanding to NT88 NT26, which is NT8 \u2192 t56 and NT26, which after expansion, leads to t32.\n\nWait, the second symbol is t32. Let me see: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. NT88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t56. NT26 \u2192 NT68 \u2192 NT54 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 NT25 \u2192 ... Hmm, maybe I'm not tracking correctly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since each non-terminal leads to two other non-terminals, perhaps I can see the string as a binary tree and check for consistency.\n\nAnother observation: the string starts with t56 and ends with t53, which is a terminal. Looking at the productions, NT53 \u2192 't48' via NT72, which might not be the path.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the grammar can produce the first symbol, t56. Looking at NT88, which is the first non-terminal. From NT88, the production is NT8 \u2192 t56, so yes, t56 can be derived from NT88.\n\nSo the first symbol t56 comes from NT8. Then, the second symbol is t32. The second non-terminal from S is NT26, which leads to NT68 and NT13. Let's see what NT68 does: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. From NT54 \u2192 NT16 and NT25, etc. Wait, this might not be leading me anywhere.\n\nWait, looking back at the string, the second symbol is t32. So the non-terminal NT26 must produce t32 somehow. Looking at the productions for NT26: it can go to NT68 and NT13. But in the grammar, NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. Let me check what NT54 does: NT54 \u2192 NT16 NT25. Then NT16 \u2192 NT25 NT55, but this seems to get stuck in a loop without terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let me check NT26's productions again. From the given list, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 NT54 NT28 (since NT68 produces NT54 and NT28). Then NT28 \u2192 t56. So, from NT26, after two steps, we get NT54 and NT28. NT28 produces t56, so the second symbol would be t56, but in the string, the second symbol is t32. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the order. Let me recheck:\n\nThe S expansion is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first terminal from NT88 is t56. The second non-terminal is NT26. What produces t32?\n\nLooking at NT26's productions: NT26 \u2192 NT68 and NT13. Now, NT68 \u2192 NT54 and NT28. NT54 \u2192 NT16 and NT25. NT16 \u2192 NT25 and NT55. NT25 \u2192 t55. Wait, so NT16 \u2192 t55 and NT25, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps NT26 \u2192 NT68 \u2192 NT54 \u2192 NT16 \u2192 t55 and NT25 \u2192 t55. Wait, no, NT25 \u2192 t55 directly. So from NT25, we get t55. But then how does NT26 get to t32?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step. Let me look for a production where NT26 can directly lead to a terminal t32. Looking through the productions, I don't see any production for NT26 directly leading to t32. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the string is 80 symbols long, which is even. Since each non-terminal produces two, the number of symbols generated from S should be a power of 2. Let's calculate: 2^k = 80. But 2^6 = 64 and 2^7=128, so 80 is between these. This suggests that either the parsing is incomplete or the string isn't possible because 80 isn't a power of 2. But wait, the string could have intermediate non-terminals, so perhaps the count is more flexible.\n\nBut actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each expansion doubles the number of symbols until terminals are reached. So the grammar should generate a string of length 2^k for some k. 80 isn't a power of two, which might immediately indicate that the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, no"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The non-terminals in the grammar are the NT followed by a number (like NT63, NT41, etc.), and each rule is a combination of two non-terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the minimum length of a derived string from a non-terminal is 2 (two terminals). The given string is quite long, but I need to check if it can be built from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. So, the first two generated strings must be the left and right sides of S's production: NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the substitution rules, I can see that NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 and NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So, the string must be buildable from these two parts.\n\nNext, I check the given string for occurrences of these non-terminals. The first occurrence is NT88, and the second is NT26. Wait, in the string, the very first token is 't28', which isn't any of the non-terminals. Wait, that can't be right because S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the string should start with what NT88 or NT26 can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the string. Let me check again.

So, perhaps the first symbol should come from either NT88 or NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88: it produces NT8 and NT32. Now, both NT8 and NT32 have their own rules.\n\nLet me check the rules for NT88 and NT26.\n\nStarting with NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nThen NT8 must expand into its own rules. Looking through the rules, there are several NT8 productions: \n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT29 NT55 (among others). Wait, NT8 can produce different combinations. For example, NTE8 can go to NT29 NT55 or other rules like NT41 NT20 or NT66 NT55, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT8 has multiple production rules. Let me list them:\n\nNT8:\n- NT29 NT55\n- NT41 NT20 (from NT98: NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40)\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40\nWait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. \n\nIn the provided grammar, for NT8, I see:\n\nNT8 is part of several rules but not directly. Looking through the list, I see that NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the entire list:\n\nLooking through the list, many NT X rules are provided, but for NT8, I don't directly see a rule. Wait, perhaps I need to look again. \n\nWait, actually, in the provided rules, I see that some rules are NTE rules, like NT35, but perhaps I need to parse all rules to see if any NT8 rule exists. Wait, in the provided rules, for example:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT34 (I think I misread earlier, perhaps a t at the end).\n\nWait, the actual rules are all of the form NTxx \u2192 NTyy N\u30c3\u30c4 or some terminal. I think I need to find if any NT8 has a production to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT17 can produce t47. Let's check:\n\n- For NT17: Looking through the rules, I see NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50 (among others), but I also see NT17 \u2192 t29. Let me check:\n\nYes, in the rules, there's a line: NT17 \u2192 t29.\n\nSo, NT17 can produce 't29'. So, NT17 \u2192 t29.\n\nSimilarly, other NT rules produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT11 \u2192 t4, NT6 \u2192 t6, etc.\n\nSo, the idea is that each NT can produce either two non-terminals (two NTs) or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, each step of expansion replaces an NT with a terminal or two NTs.\n\nGiven that the grammar is small, perhaps it can be parsed using a recursive descent approach.\n\nSo, the string starts with t28. Now, looking at the production rules, the start symbol, S, produces NT88 and NT26. So, the first token in the string must come from the expansion of either NT88 or NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88's rules: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part of the string should come from NT88, which produces NT8 and NT32.\n\nBut the first token is 't28', which is a terminal. So, looking at the NT rules that produce 't28', let me see:\n\nIn the rules, there's NT48 \u2192 t27, etc. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm not looking correctly.\n\nWait, the rules provided have several lines that end with 't...', perhaps indicating a terminal. Let's scan through the rules to find any NT that directly expands to a terminal.\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t29\n- NT7 \u2192 t2 (line 254: NT7 \u2192 t2)\n- NT16 \u2192 t6 (line 152: NT6 \u2192 t6)\n- NT83 \u2192 t52\n- NT35 \u2192 t44\n- NT55 \u2192 t54 (line 154: NT55 \u2192 t54)\n- NT11 \u2192 t4 (line 110: NT11 \u2192 t4)\n- NT66 \u2192 t30\n- NT59 \u2192 t15\n- NT72 \u2192 t38\n- NT48 \u2192 t27?\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nGiven the first token is 't28', which is a terminal. Therefore, 't28' must be generated by some non-terminal NT that directly expands to 't28'. So, is there any NT that has a production rule where the right side is 't28'?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- Line 48: NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n- Line 68: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\n- Line 28: NT28 \u2192 t25. Wait, is that line correct? Line 280: NT28 \u2192 t25.\n\nWait, the line numbers might be a bit off because in the user's list, it's all lumped together. Let me recount.\n\nThe rules are listed as follows:\n\nThe lines under the grammar seem to be:\n\nNT28 \u2192 t25\n\nLooking at the given rules list, yes, 't25' is the result of NT28. So, NT28 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo, the first token is 't28', which must come from NT28 \u2192 t25? Wait, no, the rule is NT28 \u2192 t25, so 't25', not 't28'. So, that can't be the case.

The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the productions are all binary (two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal). So each production will split into two parts, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: `t37 t37 t29 t38 t15 t33 t8 t32 t32 t16 t6 t28 t21 t19 t54 t20 t34 t48 t11 t1 t29 t21 t34 t52 t8 t30 t37 t15 t32 t16 t57 t15 t38 t32 t23 t19 t27 t52 t29 t53 t53 t33 t39 t53 t54 t23 t30 t57 t44 t23`.\n\nI'll start from the start symbol, S, and try to expand it step by step, matching the string.\n\nThe start rule is S -> NT88 NT26. So S can be split into NT88 and NT26. Both of these are non-terminals, so each will need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT88: It has a production NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So NT88 becomes NT8 and NT32.\n\nNow, NT8: Let's see its productions. From the grammar, NT8 has production NT8 -> NT54 NT8. Hmm, that's a recursive rule. Alternatively, looking back, maybe I miswrote the grammar. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, in the second line, under NT8 is: `NT8 -> NT54 NT8`. So it's recursive. That might complicate things, but perhaps there are other productions for NT8.\n\nWait, checking the grammar again, under NT88, it's NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So let's focus on NT8: It has a rule: NT8 -> NT29 NT54. And another: NT8 -> NT94 NT54.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the second line under NT8: Wait, no, actually, in the initial grammar, under NT8, it's written as NT8 -> NT54 NT8, which seems redundant because it's just NT8 producing itself, which would cause infinite recursion. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I misread the grammar.\n\nWait, the initial grammar provided has multiple lines.

{"custom_id":"request-797","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to answer either \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nFirst, let me recap what CNF means. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Additionally, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production. This structure is useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems quite extensive with a lot of non-terminal symbols and productions. Each non-terminal seems to have two productions, each producing two other symbols or terminals. That fits the CNF structure.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. The string is: `t23 t26 t15 t12 t11 t26 t48 t37 t17 t38 t21 t45 t54 t38 t17 t15 t1 t1 t15 t4 t33 t39 t12 t45 t47 t15 t1 t4 t47 t47 t32 t18 t8 t15 t29 t36 t38 t39 t29 t45 t15 t32 t11 t56 t19 t47 t48 t26 t8 t53`.\n\nI need to find out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by a series of leftmost replacements using the given productions.\n\nGiven the size of the grammar, directly applying the productions step by step could be very time-consuming, especially for such a long string. So maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nOne method is to create a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can produce the string by expanding the non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the string and see if each terminal in the string can be matched by a production's right-hand side, working backwards.\n\nAnother approach is to use dynamic programming since CNF grammatics can be parsed efficiently, but that might be more involved.\n\nAlternatively, since all productions are in CNF, perhaps I can model this as a tree where each node is a non-terminal and its children are the two right symbols of the productions. Since the string is a linear sequence, the parse tree must correspond to a structure where the symbols appear in the correct order.\n\nWait, the string is a series of terminals. Each production in CNF leads to two symbols, which themselves could be terminals or non-terminals. So each step of the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts. For the string to be generated, it must be that the entire string can be obtained by recursively applying the productions.\n\nSince the string is quite long (50 symbols), the parse tree must have a certain height. Let me count: starting from S, each level adds a node until we reach the leaves as terminals. The number of symbols in the string should be (2^depth) terms minus 1? Wait, no, in a binary tree, the number of leaves is 2^depth, but the total number of nodes is 2^(depth+1) - 1.\n\nBut the string is 50 symbols, which doesn't fit neatly into a power of two. For example, 2^5 = 32, 2^6=64. 50 is between, but not exactly a power of two. Wait, 50 isn't 2^n minus 1, since 2^6-1 is 63, which is more than 50. Alternatively, if the tree isn't full, it could have different structure, but I'm not sure if that's the right direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production step doubles the number of symbols. So starting from S, which might be one non-terminal, each production leads to two symbols, expanding to four, then eight, etc. So the length of the string would have to be something like 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to a power of two.\n\nBut the string has 50 symbols, which is not a power of two, so that might not be possible. But wait, in the grammar, some productions produce two non-terminals, which would further expand. So it's possible, for example, S produces NT88 and NT26. Each of those could produce two more terms, leading to four symbols, and so on.\n\nWait, but if all productions are in CNF, each non-terminal production splits into exactly two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So the total number of symbols in the string is determined by how many non-terminals are expanded into terminals versus non-terminals.\n\nFor example, each application of a non-terminal into non-terminals would increase the count by a factor. So the string's length is determined by how many of these non-terminals are resolved into terminals versus waiting to be resolved.\n\nIn any case, the string's length can be arbitrary, as it's possible to have some non-terminals further expanded, so the length doesn't have to be a power of two, just an odd number, perhaps.\n\nWait, in a full binary tree (each non-terminal expands into two symbols, each of which is a terminal or a non-terminal), the number of leaves (terminals) would be equal to the number of internal nodes plus one. So if there are k non-terminals, the total number of symbols is k+1.\n\nBut the string is 50 symbols. So 50 = internal nodes + 1 => internal nodes = 49.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly, but it's a perspective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use memoization or dynamic programming tables, but with 50 terms, that could be manageable. But it's a bit involved.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for whether each part of the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. The key is that each terminal in the string must be matched by a terminal in a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example:\n\nNT7 -> t29\nNT8 -> t29\nNT9 -> t4 (Wait, no, let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar and list out which non-terminals expand into which terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT7 -> t29 (from: NT77 -> ...)\nWait, no. Wait, the grammar seems to have multiple productions for the same NT.\n\nWait, actually, reading the grammar as written, each line is a production where the left side is NT followed by a number, and the right side is two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLet me re-examine the grammar carefully, and list all the terminals and the corresponding non-terminals and terminals they expand into.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar line by line:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. From what I remember, Chomsky Normal Form is helpful for certain parsing algorithms, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given grammar. It starts with S and has several productions. Each production seems to consist of two non-terminals, except some that lead directly to terminals when appropriate. But in this case, I'm looking at the string `t37 t16 t56 t12`, which consists of four tokens. So each token in the string must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nI think the strategy here is to map each token in the string to a production in the grammar and see if they can derive from a common symbol. If all tokens can be derived from a chain of rules that starts from S, then the string is generated.\n\nLet's start with the first token, `t37`.

Wait, looking at the list, I see \"NT88 -> NT88 NT28\" is present. Hmm, that's a problem because left recursion is not allowed in some parsers and complicates the derivation. But maybe it's a mistake because in typical Chomsky Normal Form, productions are without left recursion. Alternatively, perhaps the user allowed it, so I have to proceed accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo and it's supposed to be NT88 \u2192 NT88 NT28, which is left-recursive. But for our purposes, we'll have to proceed. However, in standard Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But in this case, some of the productions have a mix, like NT7 -> NT59 NT58, where both are non-terminals. So each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. Wait, no, looking at the list, some productions have two terminals. For example, `NT7 -> NT59 NT58` is two non-terminals, but other productions have a mix, like `NT32 -> NT73 NT42`, which are both non-terminals. Wait, actually, no, all productions are from a single non-terminal on the left to two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So, that's fine.\n\nSo, each production is A \u2192 BC, which is allowed in Chomsky Normal Form. So, in that case, the production where `NT88 -> NT88 NT28` is left-recursive, meaning that NT88 can produce itself followed by NT28. That complicates things, but perhaps it's used in the derivation in some way.\n\nBut wait, the first token is `t37`. So, we need to find a production that leads to `t37`. Looking through the grammar, I need to find a production where `NTxxx` ends with `t37`. Let's scan all the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 t29 (twice)\n- NT58 \u2192 t6 (as in NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4; 4 is a terminal, but 33 is NT33 which produces t1)\nWait, no. Let me look for any NT productions that lead directly to 't37', 't16', etc.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> t1\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4 \u2192 which would produce t1 t8? No, because NT33 \u2192 t1 and NT4 \u2192 t8. So NT58 \u2192 t1 t8?\nWait, in the list, NT58's production is given as NT58 -> NT33 NT48. But then looking further, NT48 is in another production. Wait, no, I need to look for any direct terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions. For instance:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t47\n- NT90 \u2192 t53\n- NT91 \u2192 t51\n- NT57 \u2192 t8? Wait, no.\n\nWait, let me go through each production and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT88 NT28 (left-recursive, but it's a terminal pair?)\nWait, NT28 is a terminal because in NT55 \u2192 t54, and NT54 \u2192 t16, and so on. Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, first, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the grammar consists of productions where on the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, the production NT7 -> NT59 NT58 would be used to generate a string of two non-terminals, which would then be expanded further.\n\nIn order to reach the string `t37 t16 t56 t12`, each of these tokens must be derived from some non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo let's tackle each token separately:\n\n1. `t37`: We need to find a production that can derive `t37`.\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT88 \u2192 NT88 NT28, but that's left-recursive and both symbols are non-terminals. Wait, but NT28 is in another production: NT28 \u2192 t56. So if I can get to NT28, that would produce t56, which is different. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminals that directly produce t37. Let me scan through again.\n\nLooking for \"NTX \u2192 t37\":\n\n- I don't see any NT rules that produce `t37` directly. So perhaps I need to derive t37 through a series of productions. Wait, but I need to see if it's possible to derive each token, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some of the non-terminals can be used to generate these terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 can be a starting point. So S can produce NT88 and NT26, each of which then generate parts of the string.\n\nBut S needs to be the start symbol, so the entire string must be generated by expanding S. Let's see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and then NT88 can produce some sequence, and NT26 can produce another.\n\nWait, let me see which rules involve NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT88 NT28. Hmm, left-recursive, which complicates things. So perhaps it's possible to expand NT88 to NT88 NT28 multiple times, but eventually, we need to derive a terminal symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT88 can't derive t37, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps NT88 can be part of a longer chain that leads to t37.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to a specific left derivation or a right derivation, but I'm getting a bit stuck.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: look for the longest possible chain of productions that can reduce to the given tokens.\n\nWait, the string is `t37 t16 t56 t12`. Let's see each token.\n\nt37: Perhaps in NT17 \u2192 t47, NT54 \u2192 t16, etc. Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps let's look for NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58. NT58 \u2192 t6 or something else. Looking again, I see NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT48, and NT48 possibly leads to something.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, looking more carefully:\n\nWait, I think I need to create a parse tree for the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-31","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the string `t37 t16 t25 t12` can be generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The given grammar seems to fit that structure, with all productions on the left side having either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of four terminals: t37, t16, t25, t12. To see if this string can be generated, I'll break it down into pairs of terminals, since each production in CNF either introduces two non-terminals or one terminal. Each pair should correspond to a leftmost or rightmost derivation in two steps.\n\nLet me list the possible pairs in the string:\n\n- Pair 1: t37 and t16\n- Pair 2: t25 and t12\n\nI'll check each pair against the rules in the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first pair: t37 and t16.\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT87 -> 't37' (as per NT87 -> t37) and\n- NT40 -> 't16' (NT40 -> t16).\n\nSo, the combination could be NT87 NT40.\n\nWait, I need to see if there's a production that directly includes these.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, looking for NT87 and NT40 as possible pairs. Looking back, in the production rules:\n\n- NT70 -> t17? Wait no, looking through the rules:\n\nWait, the NT40 production is:\n\nNT40 -> t6. Wait, no, NT40 has two rules: NT40 -> t6 and NT40 -> t16? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nWait, I might have misread earlier. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT40 -> t6 and NT40 -> t16. So, both t6 and t16 are terminals from NT40.\n\nSimilarly, I see:\n\n- NT87 -> 't37' is one possibility, and NT40 can produce t16.\n\nSo, the first two terminals could come from NT87 and NT40. But how do these NTs get their values? Let's see if there's a production for NT87 and NT40 in a way that combines them. Or perhaps, each of these NTs can be expanded further to generate the other required terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. The string has four terminals, which would require three production steps, each expanding a terminal or a non-terminal. Since each production in CNF is two symbols, I need to see if each step can break down the terminals appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should work backwards from the generated string, trying to see if each terminal can be a result of a single production.\n\nLet's try the reverse approach. Starting from the four terminals, see if each can be the result of a non-terminal production, and if the non-terminals can be connected through other productions.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each consecutive pair is a possible expansion from a non-terminal. For example, in context-free grammars in CNF, the string must be a sequence where each adjacent pair is generated by a production. So, the string can be viewed as:\n\nt37 t16 t25 t12\n\nWhich would imply that each adjacent pair (t37 t16), (t16 t25), (t25 t12) must be part of some production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but actually, in CNF, each production is a -> BC or a terminal. So, the entire string would have to be formed by a series of productions where each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, which can then be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, for four terminals, there must be a way to derive them from a structure that can expand appropriately.\n\nLet me check each pair:\n\n1. t37 t16: Is there a production NT where NT can produce 't37' and 't16'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT87 -> 't37', and NT40 can produce 't16'. So, perhaps the first NT is NT87 and NT40. So, NT87 -> 't37', NT40 -> 't16'. So, the pair is covered.\n\n2. t25 t12: Similarly, is there a production NT where NT can produce 't25' and 't12'? Looking at the grammar, I see NT56 has a production NT56 -> 't25' and 't12'? Wait, not exactly. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT56:\n\n- NT56 -> NT22 NT48 from the rules? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 has a production NT22 -> 't44' or other? Let me look:\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT55 -> t8\n- NT56 -> NT22 NT48. Oh, so NT56 can produce NT22 and NT48. Now, does NT22 or NT48 produce 't25' or 't12'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\n- NT22 -> 't44' (from NT40) and another production? Let's see:\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nNT40 -> t6 or t16. Not t22. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking for 't25':\n\nIn the grammar, NT28 -> t56, and NT56 -> NT22 NT48. So, if NT56 produces NT22 and NT48, and if NT22 can produce 't25' and NT48 can produce 't12', then the pair t25 t12 can come from NT56 -> NT22 NT48, with NT22 -> 't25' and NT48 -> 't12';\n\nWait, but looking back, I don't see a production for NT22 -> 't25'. Let me check all NTs with 't25'.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't44'\n\nAh, so NT22 produces 't44' as a terminal, not 't25'. So that approach might not work. Maybe another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair t25 t12 comes from another NT. Let me look for NTs where the productions can yield t25 and t12.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT57: I don't see this NT in the productions provided. Wait, looking through all the NTs:\n\nWait, I see NT26, NT48, etc. Let me check each:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce 't25' and 't12'.\n\nLooking through the productions again, I don't immediately see such a NT. Maybe I need to break it down further.\n\nAnother approach: maybe t25 can be derived from NT58:\n\nLooking at NT58: I see NT58 has two productions:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n\nSo, can any of these lead to t25?\n\nWait, looking:\n\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22. So, if NT58 -> NT33 NT4, and then NT4 can split into NT20 NT22. If NT22 can produce t25, but earlier I saw NT22 only produces t44. Alternatively, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, alternatively, looking for t25 somewhere else. Let's see if 't25' is produced by a single NT. Looking through:\n\n- NT48's productions: NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and NT18's productions, but I don't see 't25' in any NT48's productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should consider the entire string as generated by a combination of NT expansions.\n\nWait, let me think of the string as being generated by a series of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe string is t37 t16 t25 t12.\n\nSo, the first step could be a non-terminal NT87 -> t37 NT16.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT87 has a production: NT87 -> 't37' as per the given rules? Wait, no, the given rules under NT87 don't seem to have a production directly leading to 't37'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT91 -> NT2 NT33\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n- NT28 -> NT56\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20\nWait, I don't see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is a bit complex, so I'll approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. Each production rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, except for the termination symbols. For example, S -> NT88 NT26, and NT63 -> NT48 NT87, etc. The terminating strings (like 't27') are the points where the derivation stops.\n\nThe provided string is a sequence of 't' tokens: t37, t16, t56, t48, t1. Each 't' is associated with a number, which likely corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. So, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC, which is useful for parsing using algorithms like CYK. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a parse tree or see if each 't' can be derived from a non-terminal.\n\nI'll start by mapping each 'tX' to the corresponding non-terminal. For example, t37 comes from NT88, because in the grammar, NT88 is a production that eventually leads to t37. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for the rules that directly produce t's:\n\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT97 -> NT4 NT4: Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT33 leads to some rule, and eventually, NT33 -> 't1', so t1 comes from NT33.\n\nSimilarly, NT88 is in S's production as NT88 NT26. From the rules, I think NT88 leads to 't37'. Let me check:\n\nLooking for NT88: the rules don't directly show, but checking the full list.\n\nWait, the full list is provided. Let me search for which non-terminals lead to t's.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, I notice that some non-terminals lead directly to 't' tokens:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT75 -> 't60'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79 (ends in t via NT33 and others)\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nAlso, NT33 -> 't1'\n\nOther production rules where t's appear:\n\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n\n- NT51 -> 't39'\n\n- NT72 -> 't32'\n\nBut I think the key ones are those where t tokens are directly terminal symbols.\n\nSo, let's map each 't' in the string to a non-terminal:\n\n- t37: looking for which NT rules produce 't37'. From the full list, NT88 is in the S production, and from the rules, NT88 -> something. Wait, in the grammar, looking for rules where non-terminal leads to t37. Hmm, maybe I should look through all the rules for NT that produce 't37'.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT8 -> 't29'? No.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, I see that NT86 is a rule:\n\nNT86 -> 't9'\n\nWait, no, I need to go through all the production rules until I find where a non-terminal leads directly to a 't' token.

Maybe a better approach is to find the derivation path for the given string.\n\nThe string is t37 t16 t56 t48 t1. So, each of these must be the terminal symbols. I need to find if each can be derived as the result of a production.\n\nLet me list each token and see which non-terminal it's from:\n\nt37: Looking for NT that ends in t37. Looking at the rules, I don't immediately see that, so perhaps it's derived indirectly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the parse tree. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parsing is leftmost, and each step of the derivation is one step in the parse tree.\n\nBut manually, let's consider.\n\nThe string has 5 tokens: t37, t16, t56, t48, t1.\n\nTo derive this string, the root of the parse tree (S) must expand into a combination that leads to these tokens. The leftmost symbol in each production is pushed, and we proceed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is derived by expanding S to NT88 NT26, then each part further expanding.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nStart with S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the string would start with NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88: Wait, the production for NT88 isn't directly given in the list. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because the rules may not have NT88 as a non-terminal. Looking back.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT88, it's not present because none of the lines have NT88 on the left except perhaps in another view. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any production starting with NT88. So perhaps I was wrong. Let me re-examine the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the initial grammar, the first production is S -> NT88 NT26. So, NT88 is a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me go through the initial grammar:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nNT63 -> NT48 NT87\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nNT41 -> NT77 NT18\n\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\n\nNT51 -> NT70 NT94\n\nNT13 -> NT7 NT69\n\nNT2 -> NT87 NT70\n\nWait, that's the full list. So, the first few lines are as above.\n\nWait, looking at NT88, I don't see a production.

That means the entire string must be derivable from S, so the string we're given should ultimately expand from S.\n\nNext, I'll examine each production rule to understand how the non-terminals (NTs) expand. Each production seems to break down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals, except when a terminal 't' and a number are involved, indicating the end of the derivation.\n\nLooking at the terminals in the string: t37, t16, t25, t28, t52. I notice that these terminals correspond to specific NT productions. My goal is to trace back from each terminal in the string to see if they can flow down from NTs in a way that the entire string can be derived from S.\n\nLet me list out the relevant production rules that result in these terminals:\n\n- t37 comes from NT88 \u2192 NT32 NT48, which then produces t37 (from NT88) and t32 (from NT48).

Looking at the provided grammar rules, for NT88, I see:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see that NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT8 \u2192 't29'.

Let me check the rules again for NT88: Oh, wait, in the rules, NT88 is only present in one place: towards the end, NT7 \u2192 some rules, but looking, I don't see NT88 \u2192 anything else.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex with all these productions, and the string to check is `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t12`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has rules where each production has two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. The given grammar seems to have that structure, so that's a good start. \n\nMy approach is to work backwards from the string and see if I can derive it using the given productions. Starting with the string `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t12`, I need to find a sequence of productions that can lead to this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several terminals like 't18', 't27', etc., and some non-terminals that produce these terminals. For example, NT48 produces 't27' sometimes because in the productions like NT48 -> NT2 NT18 or NT48 -> 't27' (I think). Wait, looking back, no, actually, for NT48 it's written as `NT48 -> NT2 NT18` and also `NT48 -> NT18` perhaps? Wait, checking the grammar, yes, NT48 has two rules: one is NT48 -> NT2 NT18, and another is NT48 -> 't27' (last line for NT48). So if NT48 can produce 't27' directly, that's useful.\n\nIn the string, the second element is 't27', so the first step is to see how to get it. Looking at the options, NT48 can produce 't27' through the rule NT48 -> 't27'. So the first production would be NT48 producing 't27'. But in the string, it's the second element, so perhaps the derivation should start with the start symbol S and generate this string step by step.\n\nWait, let's think about how the grammar starts. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. So S -> NT88 NT26. The start symbol has two non-terminals, so each step, the non-terminals break down further until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me list the production for each non-terminal that ends in a terminal:\n\nNT48 -> 't27' (rule for NT48)\nNT27 -> 't27' (Is there a production for NT27? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT27 as a separate non-terminal. Instead, NT48 directly produces 't27', so perhaps that's the only way. Alternatively, maybe there's another NT that produces 't27'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an NT27 defined; instead, NT48 -> 't27'. So in the string, when I have 't27', it's likely derived from NT48. So the last element of the string is 't27', which must come from NT48 -> 't27'. So the last token in the string is 't27' comes from NT48.\n\nMoving backwards, the string is `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t12`. So working from the end:\n\n- t27 comes from NT48 -> 't27'\nThen before that, t12. Looking at NT12's productions: In the grammar, NT12 -> 't12' because in the rule NT12 -> NT22, but wait, let me check. The grammar for NT12: it's defined as NT12 -> NT22. How does NT22 produce 't12'?\n\nLooking at NT22, I see that NT22 appears in several places like NT54 -> NT13 NT22, and in other rules where it's on the left side. Let me search for NT22 in the production rules. Wait, looking through the list, I see multiple NT22 entries, but not directly. However, looking carefully, in the grammar, for NT73 -> NT75 NT83, and several other rules, but perhaps in NT22's production, it's written as NT22 -> 't33' in some line. Wait, no, looking at the list, I don't see NT22 producing any terminal directly. Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\nNT72 -> 't32'\n...\nLet me scan through each line:\n\nLooking through each line of the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT48 -> 't27'\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the initial list, I need to look carefully. The user lists all the rules. For example, in the initial grammar:\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\n...\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\nWait, perhaps NT33 is 't1' according to the rules. Wait, no, let me find where NT33 appears. Actually, looking at the rules, it says NT33 -> 't1'. So yes, NT33 produces 't1'.\n\nSo looking for NT22: Oh, there's a production for NT72 -> NT76 NT35, but not NT22. Wait, no, perhaps in the grammar provided, NT22 is only on the left side of other productions. So I need to see if any non-terminal produces 't12'.\n\nLooking at the lines, I don't see NT12 directly, but it's part of a production: from looking through the grammar, I don't see an explicit rule for NT12 leading to 't12'. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the string ends with 't12'. So how does 't12' get generated? Looking through all the grammar rules, I notice that NT12 -> 't12' is derived from somewhere? Wait, let's look:\n\nIn the rules, I see NT56 appears for several productions. Let me check NT56: the rules include NT56 -> NT53 NT90, but that's all. Wait, no, perhaps NT12 is derived from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing with NT72. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string is `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t12`.

{"custom_id":"request-62","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the string `t37 t16 t25 t19 t28 t6` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making parsing easier. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, every non-terminal (like S, NT63, NT26, etc.) has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except some that directly produce terminals like 't' followed by a number and a single quote, e.g., NT7 -> 't29'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t37 t16 t25 t19 t28 t6`. Each of these is a terminal symbol, so I need to backtrack from the start symbol S and see if this string can be derived through the grammar.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grammar to see what the start symbol S can produce. The production for S is `S -> NT88 NT26`. This means the string must start with whatever NT88 can produce and be followed by whatever NT26 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT88 and NT26:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nSo, the first two parts of the string must come from NT8 and NT32, and then NT68 and NT13. Let's check the string:\n\nt37 is the first symbol. Let's see what NT8 can produce. From the grammar, NT8 -> 't29'. But the first symbol is t37, which isn't t29. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking again: NT8's productions. Let me check the list again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n\nYes, so NT8 produces 't29', not t37. That suggests that S -> NT88 NT26 leads to 't29' followed by something else. But the first symbol in the string is t37, which doesn't match. So perhaps S isn't the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Oh, Wait: The string starts with t37, which I thought comes from NT8. Let me look at NT8's production: NT8 -> 't29'. So that's fixed. So S would lead to 't29' for the first part, but the string starts with t37. Therefore, that's impossible. \n\nWait, but perhaps the initial assumption about how the string is built is wrong. Let me think again about the structure. Each production in the grammar is a sequence of non-terminals and terminals. So the string is a sequence of terminals produced by these non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be produced by a non-terminal in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a series of productions leading from the start symbol. But each non-terminal in the production can split into more, but in the end, all terminals must match in order.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to simulate the parsing process.\n\nThe string is `t37 t16 t25 t19 t28 t6`.\n\nLet me represent this as a list: [\"t37\", \"t16\", \"t25\", \"t19\", \"t28\", \"t6\"].\n\nThe parser starts with the start symbol S and tries to match the string.\n\nSince S is NT88 NT26, the parser tries to match this structure.\n\nSo, first, NT88 needs to match the first part of the string. Let's look at NT88's production: NT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nSo, NT88 would produce the string generated by NT8 followed by the string generated by NT32.\n\nNT8 -> 't29', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, from S, the first symbol must be 't29', but the actual string starts with 't37'. Therefore, this path is impossible.\n\nWait, that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol isn't produced by any part of S's production.\n\nIs there any other way this could work? No, because S directly branches into NT88 and NT26, which in turn produce 't29' and others that don't include t37. So it's impossible for the string to start with t37.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Perhaps the grammar builds the string as a combination of the two non-terminals, each of which can produce more parts. But in this case, the first non-terminal NT88 produces 't29', which doesn't match the first symbol. So it's a clear no.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. Did I perhaps misread the production for NT8? The grammar shows:\n\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n\nYes, that's correct. So whatever comes from NT8 is 't29', which doesn't match the first symbol of the string, which is t37.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the productions (rules) from the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal (like S, NT63, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals until it eventually reaches a terminal character or one of the 't' followed by a number. The terminals are all the 'tX' where X is a two-digit number, and the non-terminals are all the NT followed by a number.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands into NT88 and NT26. So the entire string must be generated from these two non-terminals in some way.\n\nThe string given is `t37 t16 t25 t27 t30 t54 t52`. Let's break it down into individual tokens:\n\n1. t37\n2. t16\n3. t25\n4. t27\n5. t30\n6. t54\n7. t52\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be derived from S.\n\nFirst, S -> NT88 NT26.

Yes, looking at the grammar, NT88 is defined as NT8 NT32.\n\nNow, NT8 is a terminal? Let's check the rules for NT8: Oh, wait, in the grammar, NT8 is actually a string of 't29'. So NT8 is a terminal, representing 't29'. Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT8's rules: Hmm, I need to check each rule:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n\nAh, yes. So NT8 is the terminal 't29'. Similarly, NT32 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT32 expands into.\n\nNT32's production: Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n\nSo NT32 -> NT73 NT42.\n\nNow, let's expand NT73 and NT42.\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83 (from the rules).\n\nSo NT73 -> NT75 NT83.\n\nNow NT75: NT75 -> NT55 NT79.\n\nNT55: Let's check the rules. Oh, there are two entries for NT55:\n\n- NT55 -> NT54 NT52\n\nand \n\n- NT55 -> NT54 NT52.\n\nWait, actually, looking back, the rules for NT55 are:\n\n- NT55 -> NT54 NT52\n- NT55 -> NT54 NT52\n\nWait, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps both are the same. So choosing either, but probably just one way.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure. Let me look again. The rules provided include:\n\nNT55 -> NT54 NT52.\n\nYes, only one production.\n\nSo NT55 expands to NT54 and NT52.\n\nNow, NT79: NT79 -> NT22 NT48.\n\nNT22: NT22 -> NT23 NT23.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT23 NT23.\n\nWait, actually, in the rules, it's written as NT22 -> NT23 NT23. That means each NT22 becomes two NT23s.\n\nAnd NT23's production is: Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT23 -> NT12 NT12.\n\nSo NT23 becomes two NT12s. And NT12's production is: NT12 -> NT17 NT94.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Let's try to map this out.\n\nStarting from NT88: \n\n1. NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nNow, NT8 is 't29', so that's t29.\n\nThen NT32 -> NT73 NT42.\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83.\n\nNT75 -> NT55 NT79.\n\nNT55 -> NT54 NT52.\n\nNT79 -> NT22 NT48.\n\nNT22 -> NT23 NT23.\n\nSo far, the string so far is t29, followed by the expansion of NT32.\n\nLet me track each step:\n\nSo after NT88 expands to NT8 NT32, the string starts as t29.\n\nThen NT32 expands to NT73 NT42, so next part is the expansion of NT73, which is NT75 NT83.\n\nNT75 expands to NT55 NT79. NT55 is NT54 NT52, and NT79 is NT22 NT48.\n\nSo now, the string is t29 t22 [from NT22], then NT48.\n\nNT22 is NT23 NT23. Each NT23 is NT12 NT12.\n\nSo NT22 expands to NT12 NT12 NT12 NT12.\n\nEach NT12 is NT17 NT94.\n\nBut wait, NT17 has two possible productions. Let me check: \n\nLooking back, NT17 has:\n\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT17 -> NT42 NT87\n\nHmm, so NT17 can split into two different paths. This could complicate things.\n\nWait, but let's try to see if we can match the string. The string is t37 t16 t25 t27 t30 t54 t52.\n\nWait, but wait a second, the first token is t37. But according to NT88's expansion, the first token is t29, which doesn't match t37. That's a conflict. So that means that the string starts with a t37, but from S -> NT88 NT26, the first token should be t29, which is not t37. So that suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol must be t29, which doesn't match t37. Hence, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, the start is S -> NT88 NT26. Each of these must be expanded and concatenated, so the first symbols must come from NT88 and then NT26. So the first token from NT88 must be the first symbol of the string.

Hmm, maybe it's easier to look at each terminal and see which rules produce them.\n\nAlternatively, let's list each terminal and what non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t1 is produced by NT11 -> t11 (from the grammar: NT7->t2 etc., but wait, looking at the list, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, many rules produce terminals. Let me go through some of them:\n\n- NT13 -> NT53 NT33; but also NT13 -> NT85 NT40; and NT13 -> NT58 NT83; and another NT13 -> NT53 NT33.\n\nWait, but in the terminals, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> t1.\n\nSo when NT33 appears, it becomes 't1'.\n\nSimilarly, NT58 -> NT33 NT4. But NT33 is t1, and NT4 is something. Let me see NT4: looking at the grammar, NT4 is defined as NT20 NT22. So NT4 would produce 't20' and 't22'? Wait, no, because NT20 can produce 't51' and NT22 can produce 't44'. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should map each terminal to the non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nLet me go through each production:\n\nLooking at NT59 -> NT14 NT20. But NT20 -> NT51 NT72, which might lead to more non-terminals, so perhaps not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the process: for each terminal in the string, find the non-terminals that can directly produce it. Then, see if the sequence can be constructed from these non-terminals.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string in order: t54, t27, t18, t16, t56, t48, t1.\n\nLet me note the non-terminals that produce each terminal:\n\n- t54: Looking at the productions, I see NT50 -> t38 (but that's not t54). Wait, looking at the list:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT58 -> t28, but that's for t28. Hmm, what about NT88 -> t8 t32. Wait, not helpful. Wait, NT41 -> t41 (something else).\n\nWait, I need to find which non-terminals in the grammar produce each of these terminals. Let's go through each:\n\nt54: Looking, in the grammar, perhaps NT54 is not directly there, but wait, looking through, I see NT17 -> t17, etc. Hmm, maybe NT58 -> t28 (but that's for t28), not t54. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the productions, many non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4. NT33 -> t1, and NT4 -> ?\n\nLooking at NT4: the production is NT48 -> t2 t18, or someone else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to start parsing the string from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S -> NT88 NT26. So the entire string should be derived from NT88 and NT26, each of which can be further split.\n\nLet me try to see if the entire string can be built from NT88 and NT26.\n\nBut wait, NT88 -> NT8 NT32, according to the grammar.\n\nSo NT88 is split into NT8 and NT32. Then, each of these can be broken down further.\n\nLooking at NT8: the production is NT88 is already part of it, but I'm getting lost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut considering the time, perhaps I should look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be generated by the grammar rules.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals in the string: t54, t27, t18, t16, t56, t48, t1.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n- t54: I need to check if any non-terminal produces 't54'. Let's look through the productions. I see:\n\n- Looking through the rules, I see NT48 -> t2 t18, but that's 't2' and 't18', which don't include 't54'.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed one. Let me go through all the productions:\n\n- NT59 -> NT14 NT20\n- NT28 -> t56\n- NT4 = NT20 NT22; and NT20 is defined as NT51 NT72, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to check for each terminal:\n\nt54: Let me check all the productions in the grammar to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't54'. Looking through:\n\n- NT40 -> t6\n- NT42 -> t18\n- NT48 -> t27\nWait, yes! NT48 -> t27. So 't27' is produced by NT48. So 't54' must be produced by some other non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking further:\n\n- NT58 -> t33 NT4 \u2192 but that's 't33' and whatever NT4 produces.\n\nWait, maybe NT54 is a non-terminal, but in the grammar, I only see NT58 -> t33 NT4. So not directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again to see if any NT ends with '54'.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NTs ending with '54', except for NT54. But I don't see NT54 being defined in the rules. Wait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions are:\n\nLooking for any NT that ends with 54. Hmm, I don't see any. So perhaps 't54' is derived from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking again, I think I might have missed something. Let me recheck the grammar rules:\n\nFor example, NT48 -> t2 t18 \u2192 but that's 't2' and 't18', which are 2 and 18.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce 't54' directly. So maybe the string is not possible because t54 isn't derived from any non-terminal in the given grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the user provided a string, and perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I'm not considering that nt54 might be a non-terminal defined elsewhere. Or perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe my mapping is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for the rule that produces 't54', I only see NT58 -> t33 NT4. So NT58 can produce t33 followed by whatever NT4 produces.\n\nIf NT4 produces a terminal, like perhaps NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce 't54'? No, because in the rules, NT4 is defined as NT20 NT22. Let me check NT20 and NT22.\n\nNT20 -> NT51 NT72; NT51 -> NT2 NT17; NT2 is 't36'; NT17 -> t17,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can have one. The grammar here starts with S -> NT88 NT26. All other non-terminals seem to split into two other non-terminals except for a few, like NT48, which can produce a terminal or non-terminal. Wait, no, looking closer, some of the non-terminals do have terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions should be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, some rules seem to have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, which might indicate that it's not in CNF, but maybe it's been modified to allow terminals in the right-hand side. Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar, and some rules are like NT48 -> NT28 't56'. That's a mix of a non-terminal and a terminal. Hmm, but CNF requires all productions to have either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, if that's the case, maybe some of these productions have terminals on the RHS, which might complicate things.\n\nBut regardless, let's focus on the string to evaluate. The string is `t37 t16 t25 t29 t27 t30 t8 t6`. So, eight tokens, all terminals, no non-terminals. So, each token must be derivable from the left-hand side and right-hand side of some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can map some of these tokens to their possible sources. Let me make a list of the tokens and see if they can be generated from the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list the tokens:\n\nt37, t16, t25, t29, t27, t30, t8, t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can see the production rules where terminals appear.

Hmm, where do I start? I'm a bit new to this, but I think I can figure it out by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have productions where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals. Each production is in the form A \u2192 BC, except for the base cases where terminals replace non-terminals directly. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, most of the productions are non-terminals splitting into other non-terminals, with some directly leading to terminals. So, this seems to fit CNF since all productions are either two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals. To check if it's generated by the grammar, I think I need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S, and each step expands non-terminals until only terminals remain, forming the string.\n\nThe string is `t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27`. There are 8 tokens, so the derivation must have 8 steps, each adding a terminal, leading to the entire string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, S can be split into NT88 and NT26. Each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded into the corresponding sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me see the given string in order and map it back to possible non-terminal expansions.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t29. Looking through the grammar, I need to find where a non-terminal directly produces t29. Scanning the productions, I notice that NT17 \u2192 t29. So, one possible way is NT17 \u2192 t29.\n\nBut wait, how does the whole string come together? Maybe I should build the parse tree bottom-up, starting from the string and see if each token can be matched by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if there's a production path from S that leads to this string by substituting each non-terminal step by step.\n\nLet's see:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo, first, I need to expand NT88 and NT26 such that their concatenation forms the string. Let's break down the string into two parts, each corresponding to NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string: t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27.\n\nIf I split this into two sequences, each being the expansion of NT88 and NT26, perhaps of lengths totaling 8 tokens. But NT88 and NT26 would each be sequences of terminals produced by their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let's see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nLooking at NT88, perhaps it's part of the initial productions. Wait, the grammar has NT88 \u2192...? Let me check the productions for NT88. Looking through the provided productions, I see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT32\n- NT83 \u2192 NT75 NT83 (Wait, or no, let me check: looking at the list, I see NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50, NT50 \u2192 't53', etc. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for how NT88 gets derived. Wait, in the provided productions, does NT88 have any expansion? Let's scan:\n\n- NT88: Hmm, I see S \u2192 NT88 NT26, but I don't see NT88 having a production. So, maybe NT88 is a terminal? Wait, but NT88 is written as a non-terminal since it's part of the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So perhaps I'm missing this. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the productions, the ones starting with NT... So, for example, NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, etc. I don't see any productions for NT88, except maybe if I missed one.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a line. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT83 NT32 (Wait, actually, looking at the provided list, I don't see NT88 being defined. Hmm, perhaps I misread. Wait, in the list, is there a production for NT88?\n\nLooking through the list, I see S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and other lines like NT77\u2192NT33 NT79, etc. But I don't see NT88 itself being on the left side of a production. So maybe NT88 is a terminal. Wait, but that can't be because in CNF, non-terminals are the ones that expand, and terminals are the ones that are the leaves.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. In the grammar, NT88 is a non-terminal that must expand into other non-terminals until terminals are reached. But since S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and there's no production for NT88, does that mean NT88 is a terminal? Because without a production, it can't expand further. But that seems odd because in CNF, all non-terminals must have productions. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading.\n\nWait, looking back, maybe I missed a production for NT88.

{"custom_id":"request-129","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it easier to work with because every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S, which can produce a terminal or a non-terminal followed by a non-terminal.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27`.\n\nFirst, I should understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal can expand into two other non-terminals, except when a non-terminal expands into a terminal symbol. For example, I notice that some non-terminals eventually expand into terminal strings, like NT55 -> t8 or NT2 -> t36.\n\nGiven the string `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27`, it's a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a derivation path from S to this string through the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate this string. Alternatively, I could use the fact that the grammar is in CNF and apply the CYK algorithm or a similar parsing method. However, since the grammar is quite extensive, it might be time-consuming, so I'll look for a more straightforward approach.\n\nLooking at the string, it has 9 elements, so the derivation must start with S, which from the given grammar, goes to NT88 NT26. So the string must be the concatenation of t6, t60, etc., corresponding to the expansion of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me break down the string into two parts: the first part should come from NT88, and the second from NT26.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nSo S produces two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Therefore, the string must be a concatenation of what NT88 generates and what NT26 generates.\n\nThe given string is `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27`. Let's split this into two parts. Wait, but NT88 and NT26 must each produce a certain string, and their concatenation should be the string.\n\nBut the given string has 9 tokens, so maybe NT88 produces k tokens and NT26 produces (9 -k) tokens. Or perhaps each non-terminal can split into more non-terminals, leading to more tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see what NT88 and NT26 expand into.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT8 -> 't29' (a terminal, so that's a leaf)\nNT32 -> NT56\nNT56 -> 't56' (terminal)\n\nSo NT88: NT8 -> t29, and NT32->t56. So NT88 produces t29 t56. Wait, but in the grammar, NT88 is in Chomsky Normal Form, so it would produce two non-terminals, each of which would then produce their terminals or other non-terminals. Let me retrace:\n\nWait, no. Let me go step by step for NT88:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nNow, NT8 -> 't29' (terminal) and NT32 -> NT56. NT56 -> 't56'. So NT32 produces t56.\n\nTherefore, NT88 produces t29 t56, which would be two tokens.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first few tokens are t6, t60, etc. So maybe I'm looking at NT88 in the string, but the first token is t6, not t29.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Wait, in the initial part:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nBut then NT88, when expanded, would produce NT8 and NT32. Then, NT8 is 't29' and NT32 is NT56, which is 't56', so NT88 produces t29 t56.\n\nBut the given string starts with t6, so perhaps I need to check if NT88 can produce a sequence that starts with t6.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the production rules for each NT. Let me go through each part step by step to see where the terminals come from.\n\nWait, starting from S: S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nIf I need the string to be t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t15 t11 t27, which is 9 tokens, that's the product of S, so the two non-terminals NT88 and NT26 must expand into some terminal sequences whose concatenation is this string.\n\nEach non-terminal is in the form NT###, so perhaps I should look at each of them and see their expansions.\n\nStarting with NT88:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT8 -> 't29' (terminal)\nNT32 -> NT56\nNT56 -> 't56' (terminal)\n\nSo NT88 produces 't29' and 't56' as two tokens. Therefore, the string generated by NT88 would be t29 t56.\n\nBut looking at the given string, the first token is t6, so perhaps I'm wrong here. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking up the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules. The grammar is written as S -> NT88 NT26, and each NT is a non-terminal with two productions. For example:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT8 -> 't29'\nNT32 -> NT56\nNT56 -> 't56'\n\nSo S -> NT88 NT26, which would produce (output of NT88) concatenated with (output of NT26).\n\nAs I saw, NT88 outputs t29 t56, and perhaps NT26 outputs something else.\n\nWait, let me now check NT26:\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28\nNT54 -> 't16' (terminal)\nNT28 -> NT56 (->'t56')\n\nSo NT54 produces t16, and NT28 produces t56. Therefore, NT68 is NT54 and NT28: t16 t56.\n\nThen, NT26 is NT68 and NT13: t16 t56 and NT13.\n\nNow, what does NT13 produce? Let me look through the grammar:\n\nNT13 has rules like NT13 -> NT7 NT69, NT13 -> NT58 NT83, etc. Let me pick one of its rules to see what it produces.\n\nFor example, one rule is NT13 -> NT7 NT69. NT7 is 't4', and NT69 is 't27'. So that would give t4 t27.\n\nAnother rule is NT13 -> NT58 NT83, which might produce t58 and whatever NT83 produces.\n\nBut wait, in the given string, the last token is t27, which could match NT7 -> t4, but then followed by another terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the entire production tree.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others. The string is being reduced by looking at each non-terminal in the grammar and seeing if any of their expansions match a prefix of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a top-down parsing approach, trying to see if the start symbol S can derive the string step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can check whether each required terminal is produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string:\n\nt6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t15, t11, t27.\n\nI need to see if each of these is a production of some non-terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t6 is produced by NT18, as per the entry:\nNT18 -> 't6'\n\n- t60 is produced by NT42, as per:\nNT42 -> 't60'\n\n- t52 is produced by NT17, as per:\nNT17 -> 't52'\n\n- t18 is produced by NT11, as per:\nNT11 -> 't18'\n\n- t16 is produced by NT54, as per:\nNT54 -> 't16'\n\n- t56 is produced by NT28 and NT35, etc. Specifically, from the grammar:\n\nNT56 -> 't56'\n\n- t15"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-120","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string in question is `t29 t27 t18 t16 t25 t19 t27 t47 t6`. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to walk through my thoughts step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar is already in CNF, which is good because it means the leftmost derivation is a standard way to parse the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the entire string must be a sequence of symbols derived from these NT88 and NT26. \n\nI'll try to reconstruct the derivation from the string to see if it can be generated by S.\n\nThe string is: t29 t27 t18 t16 t25 t19 t27 t47 t6.\n\nWait, the string starts with t29. Let me check which non-terminals produce t29.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT72 \u2192 NT11 NT22 and NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55. Also, NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50. But I also see NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72 and NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, let me look for the production that directly produces t29. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT20 \u2192 't36' but that's not helpful. Wait, checking more carefully:\n\nWait, let me go through each production that results in a 't' symbol. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice several nodes that produce t:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't29' (from NT17 \u2192 NT59 NT58, and NT59 is 't15' and NT58 is 't28')\nWait, no, NT59 is 't15' but that's not directly t29. Looking again:\n\nLooking for 't29' directly: NT17 \u2192 't29'\n\nYes, that's the case. So, NT17 can produce 't29'. Also, NT72 can produce 't29' via NT18 \u2192 't29'.\n\nWait, actually, wait: The productions for 't29' are:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't29' (from NT17: 't29')\n- NT72 \u2192 't29'\n\nSo, to produce 't29', either NT17 or NT72 can be used.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t29. So, that can come from NT17 \u2192 't29' or NT72 \u2192 't29'.\n\nLet's assume it's NT17 \u2192 't29' for now. So, the start symbol S is NT88 NT26. Then, NT88 and NT26 will have to be expanded further.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so both NT88 and NT26 need to be derived to produce the string. But our string starts with t29, which is either from NT17 or NT72. But wait, the first part of S is NT88 and NT26, so both must be expanded.\n\nWait, no: each production rule is applied in a way that the string is built from the left. So, starting with S, which is NT88 NT26, so the first step is to expand NT88 and NT26 into their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps the string is generated by expanding the start symbol S into NT88 NT26, each of which is a non-terminal that can be expanded further until the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo, in the first step, the start symbol S produces NT88 NT26. Each NT88 and NT26 must be expanded until they produce terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to start with t29, t27, etc., it's better to see the possible derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to try to match the string from the end towards the start, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if all the terminal symbols in the string can be matched by the productions in the grammar.\n\nWait, but in the string, each symbol is a 't' followed by two digits. So, the string is a sequence of 9 tokens. Let me count: `t29 t27 t18 t16 t25 t19 t27 t47 t6` \u2192 9 tokens.\n\nIn the grammar, I notice that the S rule is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the string must start with NT88 and NT26 being expanded, and their expansions must produce the tokens in the string.\n\nWait, but let's see: perhaps each of the NTs in S will produce a chain of expansions leading to the string.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could be generated. Let's look at the string:\n\nt29, t27, t18, t16, t25, t19, t27, t47, t6.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if each of these can be matched by the productions, starting from the root.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, both NT88 and NT26 must expand into sequences of terminals that, when combined, form the string.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t29. So, maybe NT88 starts with t29.\n\nLooking at NT88 in the grammar, I can check its productions. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT88 having any productions except what's listed for other NTs. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar again, I see NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT55, but that's it. Wait, so NT88 is defined as NT83 NT55?\n\nWait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, here's a snippet:\nNT88 -> NT83 NT55\n...\nLooking up each line might help, but perhaps it's easier to look for the NT that starts with t29.\n\nAs I saw earlier, both NT17 \u2192 't29' and NT72 \u2192 't29' (from NT18 \u2192 't29').\n\nSo, for the first symbol t29, it could come either from NT17 or NT72.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: t29 is from NT17.\n\nSo, NT17 \u2192 't29'.\n\nBut then, NT17 is on the left side of S. So, let's see how S would expand. Let's see what S produces: S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, to generate the string, both NT88 and NT26 must be derived into sequences of symbols that match the rest of the string.\n\nLet me first consider NT88. So, NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT55.\n\nNow, we can look at the grammar rules for NT83 and NT55.\n\nNT83: Looking through the productions, I see NT83 \u2192 't52'. So, that would give us 't52' as the next symbol. Wait, but in the string, after t29, the next token is t27, then t18, etc.\n\nWait, but if NT83 \u2192 't52', that would produce 't52', but our string after t29 is t27. So that might not fit. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, for NT83: I see that in the grammar, NT83 is defined as some NTs. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLooking for NT83: I see NT83 \u2192 't52' in one of the entries. So yes, NT83 can produce 't52'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for NT55: I see NT55 \u2192 't48' and NT55 \u2192 't15' as productions.\n\nHmm, that's an issue because if NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT55, then NT83 would produce 't52' and NT55 would produce 't48' or 't15'. So, combining these, after NT88 expands, we might get a sequence like 't52 t48' or 't52 t15', but our string starts after t29 with t27, which doesn't match.\n\nSo, that suggests that perhaps NT88 cannot be part of the derivation starting with t29. Therefore, Option 1 might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I took the wrong NT. Let's try Option 2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That means, in the string, we need to split it into two parts corresponding to NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string: the first part must be a derivation of NT88 and the second of NT26.

No, in the list, `NT2 -> 't36'`? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to build the derivation.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo the start is NT88 and NT26. They each need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT88 and NT26. Let's see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 (line `NT88 -> NT8 NT32`)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 (line `NT26 -> NT68 NT13`)\n\nSo after first step, string is [A] [B], where A is NT88 \u2192 NT8 and NT32; B is NT26 \u2192 NT68 and NT13.\n\nSo now, we have four symbols to expand: NT8, NT32, NT68, NT13.\n\nLet's look at each of these:\n\n1. NT8: Looking for NT8 \u2192 ? In the rules, I don't see NT8 being expanded. Wait, did I miss it? Let me check the rule list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69 (line `NT13 -> NT7 NT69`)\n- NT17 \u2192 ?\nWait, maybe I overlooked NT8. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the rule list, I see `NT88 -> NT8 NT32`. So NT8 is part of NT88, but I don't see any rule for NT8 except being a left-hand side. Wait, no, are there any other NTs that produce NT8? Or maybe NT8 is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal uses: I see 't29' which is mapped by NT17 or something? Or maybe NT48 -> 't29'? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT20 -> NT51 NT72 \u2192 not relevant.\n\nWait, wait, no\u2014NT35 -> 't44' and others. Wait, perhaps I'm going about this wrong.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the string starts with 't29', so I need a path that starts with NT17 -> 't29'. Let me check: looking for a production where NT produces 't29' or similar. Wait, I see a rule `NT58 -> 't29'`. So if I have NT58, it can be 't29'.\n\nWait, but how does NT58 get into the derivation? Let me try to see.\n\nWait, let me backtrack. We have S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo after expanding, we need to derive the string starting with these symbols. But to get 't29', maybe NT58 is involved later in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another path. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me try to see what the string is: t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t27 t30 t52 t52.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t29: perhaps from NT58 \u2192 't29'\n- t60: maybe NT60 is a terminal, but it's not. Since the grammar is in CNF, all terminals are single symbols, but according to the rules, all NTs are expanded into two symbols. So if t60 is present, it must come from an expansion that eventually produces it. Wait, but none of the NTs directly produce t60. Or maybe one of the terminals is 't60'. Alternatively, perhaps 't60' comes from a production that reduces to a single symbol. But in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C can themselves be terminals or non-terminals. So all terminals are atomic; hence, the parsing must result in a sequence of terminals with no non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when expanding, some paths may require branching, but considering that the grammar is context-free, perhaps the string can only consist of certain terminals. Let me see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a recursive descent approach to check the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to check whether each token in the string is present in the grammar as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules: terminals are:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nThe string we're evaluating consists of a series of terminals: t37, t16, t25, t36, t47, t55, t44, t53, t27, t26, t6. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol S, it directly expands into NT88 NT26 (since S \u2192 NT88 NT26). This means the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and the string starts with t37, which is associated with NT88 because in the grammar, NT88 \u2192 t37. So, the first part makes sense: NT88 produces t37, and we move on to NT26.\n\nNext, look at NT26. From the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So now, we have t37 followed by whatever NT26 produces. The next part of the string is t16. Wait, but NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, so after NT26, we need to see if t16 is the result of a terminal production by one of these. Looking at the rules, NT13 can produce certain things. Wait, let me get back.\n\nWait, the string is t37, t16, etc. So after NT88 \u2192 t37, NT26 is used, which is NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So the first symbol from NT26 is what? NT68 and NT13. Let me check if either NT68 or NT13 can produce t16.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT43 isn't present, so perhaps I should check each production. Looking at NT13: Oh, wait, there's a rule for NT13. Let me look: There are multiple NT13 rules. One of them is NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83. Another is NT13 \u2192 NT14 NT20. Another is NT13 \u2192 NT85 NT40. And one is NT13 \u2192 NT40 NT83. Wait, not sure yet. Also, NT13 \u2192 NT13 NT93 is not relevant here.\n\nHmm, maybe I should approach this by building the derivation step by step. Let's outline the possible steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 t37 [Now, we have t37, and need to process NT26.]\n2. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 \u2192 So, what does NT68 produce? Looking through the rules, NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. So NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. Then, NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT55. NT13 has many options, but let's see: NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT55. Then, NT55 \u2192 NT52 or NT54. Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should start matching the string and see if each step leads to the next token.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the first symbol.\n\n1. t37: Matches NT88, so S \u2192 NT88 NT26 is used. Now, after NT88, we have NT26 next, which starts with t16.\n\n2. Next token: t16. So NT26 needs to produce something that starts with t16.\n\nLooking up NT26's productions: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. So, after NT68, the next symbol is the first symbol of NT68's production. Let's look at NT68: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. So, the first symbol would be the first symbol of NT54 or NT28.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Maybe another approach: Build possible paths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check all possible ways the string could be generated by the grammar. Since the string is relatively short, maybe a top-down approach would help, using the grammar's productions to see if each symbol can be matched.\n\nLet me try to break down the string:\n\nt37 t16 t25 t36 t47 t55 t44 t53 t27 t26 t6.\n\nThe string has 11 tokens.\n\nStarting with t37: From S \u2192 NT88 NT26, we get t37 as the first symbol. So that's matched.\n\nNow, processing NT26. NT26's productions are:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo after t37, we have t16, which should match either the first symbol of NT68 or NT13.\n\nNT68 produces NT54 NT28. So looking for NT54's and NT28's terminals.\n\nWait,NT54 is a non-terminal, so perhaps I need to see what produces t16.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules for NT13:\n\nLooking at the NT13 rules:\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 or NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18.\n\nWait, but in the string after t37, the next symbol is t16. So perhaps NT26 \u2192 NT13 NT68? Or is there another path?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's structure this properly.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nEach step, for each non-terminal, see all possible productions and whether the first symbols match the next token in the string.\n\nThis is a recursive process, but since the string is short, let's see.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 t37 followed by NT26's expansion.\n\nSo after t37, we have t16. This means NT26 must expand into a string whose first symbol is t16.\n\nLooking at NT26's rules: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo the first symbol would be the first symbol of NT68 or NT13.\n\nLooking up NT68's productions: NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. So NT68's first symbol is either NT54 or NT28.\n\nThen, NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT55, and NT55 \u2192 various options, but none that lead to a terminal that starts with t16.\n\nWait, so if NT68's first symbol is NT54, which leads to NT13 and NT55, but NT13's first symbols are various non-terminals, not terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 has a production NT28 \u2192 NT56 NT56, which also produces non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT68's first symbol doesn't lead to t16, meaning that NT26's first symbol might not be t16 unless NT13 starts with t16.\n\nBut looking at NT13's rules: NT13 has rules that sometimes involve NT13 (like recursive), but some have NT40, NT20, etc. Looking at the production rules for NT13, none of the branches go directly to a terminal. So NT13 always leads to other non-terminals. Therefore, NT26's first symbol would come from NT68 or NT13, which none seems to produce t16.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check NT13's rules again:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 or NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18.\n\nLooking at the terminals: NT33 \u2192 t1, NT4 \u2192 t4.\n\nWait, no, t1 and t4 are terminals because in the grammar, for example, NT33 \u2192 't1' and so on. So, if a production uses NT33, then 't1' is the terminal.\n\nSo, for NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83:\n\nNT58's first production is NT33 NT4, which would produce 't1' followed by 't4'. So the first symbol of this rule is 't1', then 't4', but wait, no. Wait, NT58's first symbol is the first symbol of its production. So if NT58 is used in a rule, does it mean the first terminal is the first symbol of its first production that's a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as each non-terminal has a list of possible terminal symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that for each non-terminal, if any of its productions begins with a terminal, then that terminal is part of the language."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-165","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that Chomsky Normal Form grammars have production rules where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols. Or wait, sometimes it's A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So this grammar seems to be mostly in that form, except some of the non-terminals are producing other non-terminals.\n\nThe given grammar has several rules, like S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the starting symbol is S, which is producing two non-terminals. The string I need to evaluate is `t37 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t38 t28 t27`. I'll need to break this down and see if the grammar can derive this string step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the production rules and see what non-terminals they produce and what they can produce eventually down to terminals. For example, looking at S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so S is going to produce two non-terminals, each of which needs to produce something that eventually leads to a terminal symbol or another non-terminal that does so. The string is 11 tokens, so S must produce 11 terminals through its derivations.\n\nLet me note that some of the rules lead directly to terminals. For instance, NT72 \u2192 t32, NT12 \u2192 t17, etc. Others lead to other non-terminals, so those would need to be expanded further. My plan is to try to see if each component of the string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t37. I need to see which non-terminal can produce t37. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT86 \u2192 t9, but that's not it. Wait, looking for NT that produce t37. Let me check each rule ending with t37.\n\nLooking through the list, I notice that NT88 \u2192 t37 (based on one of the rules). So if NT88 can produce t37, then the first symbol can be t37. So that's good. Now, how does NT88 get there? NT88 is defined as NT88 \u2192 NT16 NT54, according to the rule NT88 -> NT16 NT54. Wait, no, looking back, NT16 is another non-terminal. Let me check: the rule for NT88 is actually NT88 -> NT16 NT54 (wait, looking again: the list shows NT76 -> t55, so perhaps I missed the rule for NT88. Wait, the user provided the rules, so looking for NT88.\n\nWait, the rules are given as:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nSo NT88 is replaced by NT8 NT32. Then, I need to see what NT8 and NT32 produce.\n\nLooking at NT8 \u2192 't29' (so a terminal), and NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. NT73 is in the rules: NT73 \u2192 't27' and NT42 is 't18'.\n\nWait, so NT88 would produce t29 (from NT8) and t27 (from NT32). So t29 and t27. But wait, t37 is the first symbol. So how does NT88 produce t37?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT88 is produced by NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nWhat does NT8 produce? The rule is NT8 \u2192 't29', so it's a terminal. NT32 produces NT73 NT42. NT73 \u2192 't27' and NT42 \u2192 't18'. So combining, NT88 becomes t29 followed by t27, t18? Wait, no, the production is NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and each of those is a separate non-terminal. So in the derivation, NT8 and NT32 each expand into their respective symbols. But the string is t37, followed by t16, etc. So the first symbol is t37, but NT88's expansion is t29 (from NT8) and t27 (from NT32). That doesn't match t37. Wait, maybe I misread the rule for NT88.\n\nWait, looking again: the rules list includes NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So NT88 produces two symbols: the first is NT8, which is a terminal 't29', and the second is NT32, which is 't18'. But in the string, the first symbol is t37, so NT88 cannot be the start here because NT88 would produce t29, not t37. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I'm wrong in assuming NT88 is the starting point.\n\nWait, no, the starting symbol is S, which is NT88 NT26. So S can only expand into NT88 NT26, and from there both have to derive sequences of terminals. So in the string, the first symbol is t37. Let me see what each component of S produces.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S is going to produce a sequence of terminals, starting with what NT88 and NT26 produce. So perhaps NT88 produces something that starts with t37, and NT26 also starts with t16, given the string begins with t37 and t16.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I need to map out the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t37, t16, t25, t30, t44, t16, t25, t39, t38, t28, t27.\n\nSo 11 symbols, meaning S must expand into 11 terminals.\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo NT88 and NT26 must each expand into sequences of terminals such that when combined, they produce the string. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nFirst, NT88: from the rules, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' (terminal), NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nNT73 \u2192 't27', NT42 \u2192 't18'.\n\nSo combining, NT88 is 't29' followed by 't27' and 't18' in some order? Wait, no, because NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and each of those can be expanded. So NT8 is 't29', and NT32 is 't18' as it consists of NT73 (t27) and NT42 (t18), but wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, no: NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42, so NT32 must produce t27 (from NT73) and t18 (from NT42). So NT88 would be NT8 (t29) followed by NT32 (t27 t18). But that's three symbols: t29, t27, t18. But in the string, the first part is t37, which doesn't match any of these. So perhaps this path is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in finding which non-terminal produces t37.\n\nLooking for a rule that ends with t37. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nHmm, I can see that NT86 \u2192 t9, but that's not it. Wait, is there an NT that directly produces t37? Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any rule that produces t37 as a terminal. So perhaps t37 comes from a non-terminal that's expanded further.\n\nWait, I think I'm missing something. If t37 is in the string, it must come from a non-terminal that can derive t37. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t37 through some productions.\n\nLooking through the list again, I see that NT88 is defined as NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which produces t29 and then something. But maybe there's another non-terminal that can reach t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that. Let me check all the non-terminals and see if any of them produce t37.\n\nLooking at all the rules, none of them directly produce t37 as a terminal. So the only way t37 can appear in the string is if a non-terminal that can eventually derive t37 is part of the derivation. So perhaps I've made a mistake in identifying which non-terminals can derive t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule where a non-terminal directly produces t37.

{"custom_id":"request-181","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t56 t39 t32 t28 t27`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S which can produce terminals. Also, in CNF, every production rule must have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal or have more than two non-terminals? Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, I think in strict CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals. Or perhaps the start symbol can have a single terminal. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check the grammar to see how S is defined.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S is defined as NT88 NT26. Both are non-terminals, so that fits CNF because each production has exactly two non-terminals.\n\nNow, each non-terminal in the grammar leads to a terminal or another non-terminal. So, the entire string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if this string can be derived starting from S through the productions.\n\nTo check this, I can try to build the parse tree step by step. Starting from S, which is NT88 NT26. Both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals. Let's see their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nSo S expands to NT88 NT26, which is (NT8 NT32) (NT68 NT13). So the string generated from S will have four non-terminals here. Then each of these non-terminals will produce more, until they reach the terminals.\n\nBut the given string is 12 elements, which is longer than four, so I need to see how the parse tree progresses.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think bottom-up. The string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps each production is applied in reverse. But since the grammar is in CNF, each step only replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. So perhaps the string can be broken down into pairs that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to write the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nEach of NT88 and NT26 will expand further. Let's see what NT88 is: NT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nSame with NT26: NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo after first expansion, we have (NT8 NT32) (NT68 NT13) \u2192 these are four non-terminals.\n\nEach of these will have their own productions.\n\nNT8 -> NT7 NT22 \u2192 So NT8 expands into two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 -> NT73 NT42.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nNT8's production is NT7 NT22, and NT32's production is NT73 NT42. So let's see each step.\n\nThis could get complicated, but maybe I can look for terminals in the string and see if they match any non-terminals' terminal productions.\n\nFor example, let's look at the first two tokens: t6 and t60.\n\nt6 is one of the terminals. Looking into the grammar, where does t6 come from?\n\nLooking for 't6' in the productions, I see NT40 -> t6, and also NT42 -> t30, etc. So t6 is produced by NT40.\n\nSimilarly, t60 is a terminal. Looking for 't60', it's produced by NT75, I believe? Wait:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT75 -> NT33 NT79\n\nBut t60 is produced by NT75? Let me check:\n\nNo, looking at the productions, I don't see t60 as a terminal. Wait, maybe it's a non-terminal that's been defined? Wait, no, all non-terminals in the grammar are on the left-hand side, and their productions are into smaller non-terminals. The terminals are the ones on the right that are 't' followed by numbers. So t6, t18, t26, etc.\n\nSo for the first token t6, it's from NT40. So the first application would have to lead to t6. So the first non-terminal, say, is NT6, maybe? Wait, no, the string starts with t6, which is a terminal, so maybe it's the result of a non-terminal expanding into t6 and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nThe string is t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t56 t39 t32 t28 t27.\n\nI need to see if these can be the leaves of a parse tree starting from S.\n\nLet me try to see what each terminal corresponds to in the grammar.\n\nt6 is NT40.\n\nt60: Let's see if any non-terminal produces t60. Looking at the given productions, I see:\n\nWait, 't60' isn't in the productions on the right-hand side, so perhaps t60 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, wait, no. In the grammar, all the right-hand sides of the non-terminals consist of other non-terminals, except for the terminals. So any token in the string that is a 't' followed by a number is a terminal, and those that aren't in the grammar as right-hand sides of non-terminals must be produced directly from the start symbol or a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps t60 is produced by NT75, because in the grammar, NT75 is defined as NT33 NT79, but that's not helpful. Hmm, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps t60 is a non-terminal that doesn't directly produce a terminal, so I might have to look further up in the parse tree. Alternatively, maybe I should look at each terminal in the string and see which non-terminal produces it.\n\nLet me list each terminal:\n\nt6 \u2192 from NT40.\n\nt60 \u2192 Is this a terminal? Or is it generated by some non-terminal?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that produces t60 directly. None of the right-hand sides end with 't60'.\n\nSo perhaps t60 is a non-terminal that's higher up in the parse tree. So maybe in the string, t60 is part of a larger expansion.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach this by trying to reverse-engineer the parse tree.\n\nThe string is a list of 12 terminals: [t6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t25, t30, t56, t39, t32, t28, t27].\n\nEach production is a step from a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a bottom-up approach, perhaps I can start from the leaves and see if I can reconstruct upwards.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should write out the string and see how each terminal can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLet me list the steps from S:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nSo, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nSo after one step: NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13.\n\nEach of these will be further expanded.\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT7 NT22.\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28.\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83.\n\nSo after second step: (NT7 NT22) (NT73 NT42) (NT54 NT28) (NT58 NT83) \u2192\n\nSo now we have 8 non-terminals.\n\nEach of these needs to be expanded further.\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT2 NT87.\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83.\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT39 NT56.\n\nNT54 \u2192 NT16 NT25.\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT25 NT48.\n\nNT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4.\n\nNT83 \u2192 NT16 NT55.\n\nWait, that seems a bit long, but let's see.\n\nSo after third step, expanding all eight:\n\nNT7 becomes NT11 NT22.\n\nThen NT11 becomes NT17 NT54.\n\nThen NT22 becomes NT2 NT87.\n\nNT73 becomes NT75 NT83.\n\nNT42 becomes NT39 NT56.\n\nNT54 becomes NT16 NT25.\n\nNT28 becomes NT25 NT48.\n\nNT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is a single non-terminal generating two non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It seems like the start symbol is S, and it expands to NT88 and NT26. Each of these is a non-terminal that further splits into other non-terminals until the terminals (like 't6', 't60') are reached. My goal is to trace back from the string to see if each 't' can be derived from the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nThe string has 12 tokens: t6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t25, t18, t55, t44, t27, t47, t6. Since each production only results in two non-terminals, each token must be generated by a single production. Also, since the grammar is CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right side, so for each token, I need to check if it can be directly derived from some rule.\n\nLet me start by considering the first token, t6. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT72 -> t32 and NT66 -> t30. Also, NT12 -> t17, and NT69 is another rule but not directly related. Wait, but t6 is in the list. Looking through, I see NT72 -> t32, NT12 -> t17, and others. Wait, perhaps I should look for any non-terminal that directly produces t6. Let me check the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\n- NT87 -> t76 and t35. Not relevant.\n- NT90 -> t91 and t68. No.\n- NT98 -> t41 and t40. No.\n- NT58 -> t69 and t18. No.\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me go through each NT rule:\n\nFor example, NT48 -> t2 and t18? Wait no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the rules include NT33 -> t1, NT48 -> t27. Hmm, to get t6, perhaps I need to look for a non-terminal that produces t6. Let's check:\n\nNT58 -> t69 and t18. Not. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all the terminal rules to find which non-terminals produce t6. Looking through the provided rules:\n\n- NT88 -> t8 and t32. No t6.\n- NT58 -> t69 and t18. Still no.\n- NT40 -> t6. Ah, yes! NT40 -> 't6'. So that's one part: the first token 't6' must come from NT40.\n\nWait, but NT40 is a non-terminal. So to produce 't6', the non-terminal NT40 must derive t6 directly. So, the first token in the string is 't6', so the first non-terminal in the derivation must be NT40.\n\nNow, since S -> NT88 NT26, the first step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Each of these must be expanded into the string. The first token is t6, which comes from NT40, so I need to see how NT48, NT26 can be derived. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently.\n\nEach symbol in the string corresponds to a node in the parse tree. Since it's a binary tree, each symbol is either a terminal or a split into two non-terminals. Since all the tokens are terminals, each must be produced directly by a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for the string, each token must be matched by a non-terminal that produces it directly. Let's check which non-terminals produce each t:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\n- t6 is produced by NT40\n- t60: NT75 -> t60 (since NT75 -> t60)\n- t52: NT53 -> t48? Wait, no. Wait, let me check each rule. Let me search for which NT produces t52. Looking through the rules: \n\nWait, the rules include NT52: I don't see NT52. Oh, no, the rules include NT70 -> t11, NT7 -> t2, etc. Hmm, actually, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each token and see if any NT directly produces it.\n\nt6: NT40 \u2192 t6. So yes.\n\nt60: Looking through the rules, NT53? Let me check NT75: yes, NT75 \u2192 t60. So t60 is from NT75.\n\nt52: Looking for NT rules where the right side includes 52 as a terminal... I see NT58 \u2192 t69 and t18; no. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces t52?

No.\n- NT50 \u2192 t38. No.\n- NT50 \u2192 't53'. Wait, NT50 \u2192 t38 (from NT72 \u2192 t38), but I'm looking for a direct production. Let me check all NT rules that are terminals:\n\nLooking for \"t52\" in any rule:\n\nLooking through the entire list, I think I might have missed some. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking for 't52', do any production rules directly produce it?\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t33 and t42 (but t42 is in another rule)\nWait, perhaps it's not directly available. Let me check:\n\nNo, in the provided rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t52. Hmm, that might be a problem. Wait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nFor example, NT42 -> 't30', not t52. Wait, maybe it's via another expansion. Wait, perhaps t52 is a result of a production chain, but since the question is about directly deriving each 't' from the grammar, each 't' must be directly produced by some NT.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules.\n\nAfter going through all the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t52. Hmm, maybe that's a problem because the string contains t52, meaning it's supposed to be produced by some NT. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe I need to see if t52 can be derived from some NT via a series of steps. But wait, each token in the string must be directly produced by a NT, as each production in the grammar leads to exactly two NTs, and so on, until a terminal is produced.

{"custom_id":"request-204","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t37 t16 t25 t30 t36 t1 t16 t25 t11 t23 t38 t28 t27` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It seems to be a set of production rules where each non-terminal on the left side expands into two other non-terminals on the right side, except for the terminals which are leaf nodes. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe provided string consists of a sequence of terminals: t37, t16, t25, t30, t36, t1, t16, t25, t30, t12, t23, t38, t28, t27. Wait, hold on, looking back at the string, I see t37, t16, t25, t30, t36, t1, t16, t25, t30, t12, t23, t38, t28, t27. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me double-check the string: it's `t37 t16 t25 t30 t36 t1 t16 t25 t11 t23 t38 t28 t27`. Oh, right, so the sequence is 14 terminals.\n\nTo determine if this string can be generated by the grammar, I should try to parse it step by step using the production rules. Parsing involves breaking down the string into non-terminals using the given rules. If at any point a terminal doesn't match any production's right-hand side, or if we can't consume the entire string, then the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the top-level rule, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S generates a string starting with NT88 followed by NT26. In the output string, the first two tokens are t37 and t16. I need to find if NT88 can produce t37 and NT26 can produce t16, or vice versa. But since the first rule is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, the first two non-terminals are NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, but the first terminals are t37, t16, t25, etc. So I need to see which non-terminals produce these terminals.\n\nLooking for production rules that have a terminal as the right-hand side. For example, NT88 might produce t37 if there's a rule like NT88 \u2192 t37 NTsomething, but checking the grammar, I don't see any such rules. Wait, actually, the rules are all two non-terminals. The terminals are on the right side of other production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The rules given are all for non-terminals, so the terminals are produced by these non-terminals when they appear on the right side. For example, if a rule is NT7 \u2192 t29 NTsomething, then NT7 produces t29 followed by something else.\n\nBut looking through the rules, many of them have a terminal as one component, but only as the first or second symbol. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22: both non-terminals. Similarly, NT72 \u2192 t33 NTsomething, but in the given rules, many are two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a table of which non-terminals can produce which terminals. For example, looking for rules where a non-terminal is immediately producing a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94\n- NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33\n- NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48\n- NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT33 \u2192 NT1 NT23\n- NT28 \u2192 NT56 NT48\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n- NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58\n- NT48 \u2192 NT59 NT98\n- NT7 \u2192 NT87 NT97\n- NT87 \u2192 NT76 NT35\n- NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68\n- NT98 \u2192 NT86 NT4\n- NT13 \u2192 NT53 NT33\n- NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18\n- NT73 \u2192 t33 NT83\nWait, here's a rule: NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83. No terminal. Hmm. Let me look again.\n\nWait, I'm looking for any production rule where a non-terminal directly produces a single terminal. Looking through all the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22: both non-terminals.\n- NT75 \u2192 t60 NT55\nAh, here's one: NT75 \u2192 t60 NT55. So NT75 can produce t60 followed by NT55.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 \u2192 t54 NT...\nWait, let's check NT55: NT55 \u2192 t54 NT... Yes, in the rules provided, NT55 \u2192 t54 NT... So NT55 can produce t54 followed by NTsomething.\n\nAnd NT54: Looking for rules where NT54 appears on the left. From the rules, NT54 isn't present on the left side, so perhaps it's an intermediate. Wait, NT54 might be derived from NT8... Let me check if any rule has NT8 producing t54.\n\nLooking for any NT on the left which can produce a terminal:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 NT1 NT8\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT40 \u2192 t6 NTsomething\nWait, looking for any NT \u2192 t...\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n- NT98 \u2192 nt86 t4: No, NT98 is producing t86 and NT4.\nWait, let me list all the rules where a non-terminal on the left produces a terminal on the right:\n\nLooking through the rules line by line:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26 (non-terminals)\n- NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87 (non-terminals)\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 (non-terminals)\n- NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18 (non-terminals)\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58 (non-terminals)\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79 (non-terminals)\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22 (non-terminals)\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22 (non-terminals)\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83 (non-terminals)\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94 (non-terminals)\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69 (non-terminals)\nWait, but NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69. Both non-terminals. So no terminal here.\n\nWait, I'm not finding any production rule where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. All rules have two non-terminals on the right. That suggests that every symbol in the output string must be generated by some non-terminal which is a combination of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in that case, how do terminals get introduced? Because if all production rules produce two non-terminals, then how do we ever get a terminal in the string?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the non-terminals can lead down to terminals through multiple steps, but in the given rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79: no terminal\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22: no terminal\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18: NT2 is a non-terminal\n- NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18: both non-terminals\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83: no terminal\n- NT98 \u2192 NT86 NT4: both non-terminals\n- NT13 \u2192 NT53 NT33: both non-terminals\n- NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72: both non-terminals"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Chomsky Normal Form is a way to write CFGs where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar provided has a mix of non-terminals and terminals as productions. For example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which seems to be a production where S (a non-terminal) is replaced by two other non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. Then, looking at the later productions, some of them directly include terminals. For instance, NT75 \u2192 't60', which means this non-terminal can produce the terminal 't60'.\n\nThe string we need to analyze is all terminals: t6, t27, t18, t16, t56, t27, t55, t44, t38, t27, t30, t54, t6. It seems like we need to see if this sequence of terminals can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet's break it down. Since S starts, the first production from S must be S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So from S, we produce NT88 and NT26, and the string starts with something that must eventually derive into t6. Let me see how NT88 and NT26 can produce the first terminal t6.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Then NT8 \u2192 't29' and NT32 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, but our string starts with t6, not t29. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I need to see if there's another path. Let me check other productions.\n\nLooking at NT77: NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79, and NT33 \u2192 't1', NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48. NT22 \u2192 't44' and NT48 \u2192 't27'.

NT8 has production to 't29' and others? Wait, NT8: NT8 \u2192 't29' and another production, but I don't see any other options for NT8 except 't29'. So if I'm going down NT88, then after NT8 \u2192 't29', we have NT32 \u2192 't56' because looking at NT32: NT32 \u2192 't56'.\n\nWait, so NT88 would expand to t29 and t56. Then S \u2192 NT88 NT26 would expand to t29, NT26, and stuff. But our string starts with t6, so maybe that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm going down a different path for NT88. Wait, what are all the productions for NT88? From the list, I see:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nIs that the only production for NT88? From the given list, yes, only that line. So from NT88, we have to go through NT8 \u2192 't29' and NT32 \u2192 't56'.\n\nSo the first two symbols from S would be t29 t56. But the string starts with t6 t27... which doesn't match. So that's a problem. Therefore, NT88 seems to generate t29 followed by t56, which doesn't align with our string.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me check NT26. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Then NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Wait, let's trace that: NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Then NT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT30. Then NT13 \u2192 NT58 NT83. Let's see, what's NT58? NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4. NT33 \u2192 't1'. NT4 \u2192 't54'. So that path would produce t1 and t54.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider that the string has to be generated through a series of productions starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the string as a series of non-terminals and terminals that must be derived. Let's start from the string and see if we can work backward using the reverse method.\n\nThe string is: t6 t27 t18 t16 t56 t27 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t54 t6.\n\nLet's list them in order: t6, t27, t18, t16, t56, t27, t55, t44, t38, t27, t30, t54, t6.\n\nWe can see that t6 and t6 appear, so perhaps some NTs produce t6 directly. Looking at the productions, NT40 \u2192 't6', and also NT70 \u2192 't12' (wait, no, NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12, but NT12 \u2192 't17' from NT12 \u2192 't17'). Wait, but looking at the direct terminals:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\n\nWait, NT8 \u2192 't29', not t6.

{"custom_id":"request-221","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t18 t55 t44 t1 t39 t23 t44 t60`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal (on the left side of the arrow) expands into two non-terminals. So, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals. Additionally, in CNF, the start symbol only appears on the leftmost side, and the right side consists of non-terminals and terminals. Wait, no, actually in CNF, all productions must have the left-hand side a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side two non-terminals. Terminals can't be on the left side, and they appear only on the right as a single terminal or not at all. Hmm, but looking at the given grammar, I see that some productions have terminals on the right, like some NT rules ending with 't' something. For example, NT75 -> t60. Wait, that would mean that NT75 can produce both a non-terminal and a terminal? Or does that mean that NT75 can produce a terminal directly? Because in CNF, terminals are usually on the right side. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: in CNF, a production is either A \u2192 BC (both B and C are non-terminals) or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But wait, no, in CNF, all productions must have the right-hand side as two non-terminals because each step in the derivation must break down the string into smaller parts until you reach terminals. So, perhaps the grammar provided is not in standard CNF because some productions have a single terminal on the right. But in this case, looking at the grammar, some rules have 't...' on the right side, which are terminals. So maybe it's a mix of CNF with some productions allowing terminals on the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is in a form that includes both terminals and non-terminals on the right side, but perhaps the initial step would involve treating those as leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nAnyway, perhaps I should focus on the task at hand. The string given is a sequence of terminals: t29, t60, t52, t18, etc. I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of substitutions.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the production rules and see which ones produce terminals. Because if any production rule directly gives a terminal, it might be a good starting point.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- For example, NT7 -> t2 (from NT7 -> t2 in the grammar, wait, no, looking back, the given grammar has a rule NT7 -> t2 ...? Wait, no, looking through the grammar, I see rules like NT7 -> NT11 NT22. But some have 't' followed by numbers, like NT70 -> t11. Or wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to list all the rules that produce terminals. Let me scan through the provided grammar:\n\nAt the end, I see:\n\nNT75 -> t60  \nAnother one is NT73 -> t27  \nNT94 -> t57  \nNT50 -> t38  \nAnd others like NT66 -> t30  \nNT48 -> t27  \nNT11 -> 't4' (but wait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, some rules are like NT7 -> NT11 NT22; but other rules like NT50 -> t38. So NT50 can produce the terminal 't38'. Similarly, NT72 -> t23, NT75 -> t60, etc.\n\nSo, some of the non-terminals can produce terminals. So, in the grammar, terminals are produced by certain non-terminals when they expand into them.\n\nSo, in this case, the string is all terminals: t29, t60, t52, etc. So I need to see if the derivation can lead to exactly this string.\n\nSince S -> NT88 NT26, which are both non-terminals. Each of these needs to be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nStarting with S, we have S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, to get the string, both NT88 and NT26 must be expanded into sequences of terminals that match the string.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first token is t29. So we have to see how t29 is produced.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that NT17 -> t29, because in the production, it has NT17 -> t29. Similarly, NT8 -> t29. So both NT17 and NT8 can produce 't29'.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t29. So in the expansion, either NT88 or NT26 must have a rule that produces t29. Or perhaps through a series of steps where the non-terminals derive to t29.\n\nContinuing, the next term is t60. Let's see where 't60' comes from. Looking through the grammar, I see NT72 -> t23, which isn't t60. NT55 -> t54, which isn't. Let's check NT60: Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a production for NT60. Maybe it's derived from somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps looking for NT59 \u2192 t15, which is another terminal. Another possibility: NT58 -> t28 or NT50 -> t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's outline the steps:\n\nThe string is t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t18 t55 t44 t1 t39 t23 t44 t60.\n\nThe length is 14 tokens. The grammar is in CNF, so each step should split a non-terminal into two other symbols (terminals or non-terminals). So the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n -1 for some n, but here it's 14, which is 2^4-1, so that's possible. So that's a clue that the string could be derived in 4 steps, starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful. Let's focus on each part.\n\nAt the first step, S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo we have to derive sequences for NT88 and NT26 that match the first half and second half of the string.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts, but actually, since the string is a concatenation, perhaps it's better to think that the output is the concatenation of the derivations of NT88 and NT26.\n\nBut that might complicate things because each non-terminal can have a different branch.\n\nAlternatively, I can model the entire string as a tree, but perhaps it's easier to take the entire string and see if it can be built by each non-terminal expanding into the respective parts.\n\nBut maybe I should approach it by constructing the parse tree.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t29, which can only come from NT17 or NT8, as I saw earlier.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT8 -> t29. So one possibility is that one of the non-terminals (NT88 or NT26) expands into t8, which then produces t29.\n\nBut let's go step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the derivation starts by expanding S into NT88 and NT26. These two non-terminals must then produce sequences that when concatenated, form the given string.\n\nLet me denote S0 \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nNow, in the string, the first token is t29. Let's assume that NT88 is the one that produces t29. So NT88 must eventually produce a sequence starting with t29 followed by something, and NT26 must produce the remaining tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's possible that both NT88 and NT26 start with some terminals.\n\nBut let's try to see.\n\nFirst, looking at NT88. Where is NT88 defined? Wait, I don't see a production rule for NT88 in the grammar provided. Wait, no, I don't think so. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- The rules include NT88 -> NT85 NT17.\n\nAh, so NT88 is defined as NT85 followed by NT17.\n\nWait, but in the grammar given, I can see:\n\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58\n\nNT17 has productions, like NT17 -> t29 or NT17 -> NT63 NT50.\n\nSo, from the definition, NT88 \u2192 NT85 NT17.\n\nNow, NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58.\n\nAnd NT17 can be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall that CNF grammars have productions of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A -> a, where A is a terminal. From the grammar provided, I can see that it's mostly in CNF because the productions like S -> NT88 NT26 look like they split into two non-terminals. Some non-terminals also have terminal symbols, but in the given grammar, looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminals with more than two terminal symbols in a production. So, the grammar seems correctly in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t37 t16 t25 t30 t56 t39 t32 t45 t55 t44 t38 t27 t47 t60`. I notice that these look like terminal symbols, so the string is a sequence of these terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can model the parsing as a series of steps where each step combines two non-terminals into a terminal. The standard approach would be to use the CYK algorithm, which efficiently checks if a string is in the language generated by a CNF grammar. However, applying the CYK algorithm manually for this string might be error-prone, so I'll try to approach it by building the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from a non-terminal by looking up the productions. That is, check if each 't' symbol in the string is a terminal produced directly by some non-terminal in the grammar. If all 't's can be traced back to a derivation path, then the string is valid.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production rule of the form NTx -> something could potentially derive a specific terminal. So I can create a mapping from the non-terminals to the terminals they produce. From the given rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT7 -> 't2', NT11 -> 't4', etc. Let me list out all the non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal:\n\nNT7 -> 't2'  \nNT11 -> 't4'  \nNT17 -> 't29'  \nNT2 -> 't36'  \nNT58 -> 't28'  \nNT88 -> 't8'  \nNT55 -> 't54'  \nNT18 -> 't47'  \nNT90 -> 't56'  \nNT40 -> 't6'  \nNT13 -> 't12'  \nNT59 -> 't15'  \nNT33 -> 't1'  \nNT7 -> 't59' (Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me double-check the syntax.)\n\nWait, looking again, the rules are given as NTn -> something. Let's pick out all the direct terminal productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'  \n- NT11 -> 't4'  \n- NT17 -> 't29'  \n- NT2 -> 't36'  \n- NT58 -> 't28'  \n- NT88 -> 't8'  \n- NT55 -> 't54'  \n- NT18 -> 't47'  \n- NT90 -> 't56'  \n- NT40 -> 't6'  \n- NT13 -> 't12'  \n- NT59 -> 't15'  \n- NT33 -> 't1'  \n- NT7 -> 't59' (Wait, that would be a problem because NT7 would produce both 't2' and 't59' which might conflict.)\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me parse each rule correctly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, starting with S -> NT88 NT26. Then NT63 -> NT48 NT87, and so on. So each rule is structured as the left-hand side (A) produces two non-terminals (B and C). The only direct terminals are those where a non-terminal appears and is immediately converted to a terminal, like NT88 -> 't8'.\n\nSo I need to identify all the non-terminals that directly have a production to a single terminal. From the given rules, let's list them:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\nNT7 -> 't2'  \nNT11 -> 't4'  \nNT17 -> 't29'  \nNT2 -> 't36'  \nNT58 -> 't28'  \nNT88 -> 't8'  \nNT55 -> 't54'  \nNT18 -> 't47'  \nNT90 -> 't56'  \nNT40 -> 't6'  \nNT13 -> 't12'  \nNT59 -> 't15'  \nNT33 -> 't1'  \nNT7 -> 't59' (Again, checking for the direct terminals.)\n\nWait, looking again. The rule NT79 -> NT22 NT48. That's two non-terminals, but one is NT22 and the other is NT48. Are any of these terminals? No, because NT48 again produces NT2 and NT18.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking too far. Let me check each non-terminal's production:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' (direct terminal)  \n- NT11 -> 't4' (direct terminal)  \n- NT17 -> 't29' (direct terminal)  \n- NT2 -> 't36' (direct terminal)  \n- NT58 -> 't28' (direct terminal)  \n- NT88 -> 't8' (direct terminal)  \n- NT55 -> 't54' (direct terminal)  \n- NT18 -> 't47' (direct terminal)  \n- NT90 -> 't56' (direct terminal)  \n- NT40 -> 't6' (direct terminal)  \n- NT13 -> 't12' (direct terminal)  \n- NT59 -> 't15' (direct terminal)  \n- NT33 -> 't1' (direct terminal)  \n- NT7 -> 't59' (direct terminal)  \n- NT48 -> 't27' (direct terminal)  \n- NT11 -> 't30' (Wait, no, the rule is NT11 -> 't4').\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because it simplifies the structure a bit.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 and NT26. So S -> NT88 NT26. Wait, but the string starts with t37, which corresponds to NT88.

Let me try to parse this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t37. So we need to see if t37 can be derived from one of the productions. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't37'. Wait, unless I'm missing something. Let me scan all the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule that directly starts with NT37 or anything that can derive to 't37'. For example, NT28 -> t56, NT8 -> t29, NT18 -> t47, etc. But where does t37 come from? Is there any non-terminal that can directly produce 't37'?

{"custom_id":"request-241","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and the string to evaluate is: `t6 t27 t18 t16 t56 t34 t26 t55 t44 t38 t1 t39 t23 t44 t60`.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes produce a terminal. Wait, actually, no\u2014the definition is that each production is of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. Alternatively, sometimes the start symbol can produce a terminal directly, meaning production rules can have two terminals, I think.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, the first rule is S -> NT88 NT26. That produces two non-terminals. Then, each next rule is also non-terminals. Wait, but some of them do have terminals as the end? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some rules like NT72 -> 't23' have terminals, which is important. So yes, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. That makes sense because when a non-terminal can produce a terminal, it's the base case of the derivation. Each production is a single step, so each step either breaks down a non-terminal into two others or into a terminal.\n\nSo the string we have is a series of terminals, all lowercase 't' followed by numbers. The task is to see if the grammar can derive this string. Since it's a CFG in CNF, the parsing should be possible using either recursive descent or a CYK algorithm, but perhaps more straightforwardly by simulating the derivation.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I can approach this by trying to find a leftmost derivation or ensure that all symbols in the string can be connected through the production rules.\n\nEach symbol in the string is a terminal. So each must correspond to some production rule in the grammar where the non-terminal can produce that exact terminal.\n\nFirst, let's list out the terminals in the string: t6, t27, t18, t16, t56, t34, t26, t55, t44, t38, t1, t39, t23, t44, t60.\n\nThat's 15 symbols. Since each production in CNF either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, and each non-terminal must be derived into parts that can produce these terminals, the string must correspond to a derivation where each terminal is generated by a direct production from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, but each production in CNF is binary, so for a string of k terminals, we need a parse tree with k-1 internal nodes. That implies that each symbol in the string is generated by a path from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into multiple symbols, each generated by a production of a non-terminal, and those non-terminals must be connected in the derivation tree.\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe I should approach this by trying to find the order in which the terminals could be generated.\n\nStarting with the string: the first symbol is t6. Looking at the grammar, where does t6 come from? Let's look at the rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT20 -> 't60', but that's t60. Hmm. Then, looking for 't6'\u2014wait, in the rule: NT94 -> 't57', NT13 -> 't12', NT59 -> 't15', etc. Let me go through all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking for 't6'\u2014I see NT12 -> 't17', NT8 -> 't29', NT11 -> 't30', NT66 -> 't30', NT55 -> 't54' (but that's matched to t54), NT8 -> 't6'\u2014so NT8 can produce t6.\n\nSo in the grammar, NT8 is a non-terminal that can produce 't6', which is one of our symbols. So in the string, the first symbol is 't6', which must come from NT8.\n\nNow, the next symbol after 't6' is 't27'. So we need to see what produces 't27'. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't2', NT27: From the rules, NT14 -> 't66', NT90 -> 't91' I think\u2014wait, looking back, some rules:\n\nLooking, NT72 -> 't23', NT57, etc. Let me scan all the rules for terminals:\n\nLooking at line NT28 -> 't56', NT48 -> 't27' (Ah, yes, NT48 -> 't27'). So 't27' can come from NT48.\n\nSo the second symbol is 't27', which must come from NT48.\n\nSo 't6' is from NT8, which in the production rules, NT8 can come from where?\n\nLooking through the rules, NT8 -> 't6' as we saw, but also looking for where NT8 is used elsewhere. Wait, actually, looking for non-terminals that can produce NT8.\n\nWait, no. In the given grammar, the production rules start with S and go into non-terminals, but perhaps I'm getting confused. Wait, let me clarify: Each rule is of the form A -> BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal\u2014so for example, NT51 -> 't39'.\n\nWait, so NT48 is a non-terminal that can produce 't27'\u2014so the production for NT48 is 't27', right. So to produce 't27', NT48 must be on the stack, and in the derivation, it must replace to 't27'.\n\nNow, how does NT48 get into the derivation? Because in the grammar, the left-hand sides are the non-terminals, and each production rule is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz. So the way to derive is by breaking down non-terminals into smaller non-terminals until you reach terminals.\n\nSo, to get 't6' and 't27', which are the first two symbols, we need to have a string that starts with NT8 (which gives t6) followed by NT48 (which gives t27). But wait, how? Because each production is a split into two non-terminals. So perhaps the initial step is S breaking down into NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nEach of these can then further split. Let's look at NT88 and NT26:\n\nNT88: From the rules, the production is 't8' (so NT88 can produce t8), but also other non-terminals. Wait, let's check all the rules again.\n\nWait, I think I need to look for the production rules for NT88 and NT26, but in the given grammar, they're not present except in S and other rules. For example, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT88: Wait, is there a production rule for NT88? No, I don't see NT88 in the list except as the left-hand side of S. Similarly, NT26: Do I see any production for NT26? Let me check: looking through all the non-terminals, I see NT26 is a non-terminal, but do I see any production rule for it?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any production for NT26 except in S and some others, but for example, NT26 is on the right-hand side of NT76 -> 't55', but that's not relevant.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me list all the production rules and see which non-terminals produce terminals:\n\n- NT72 -> 't23'\n- NT58 -> 't11'\n- NT17 -> 't29'\n- NT55 -> 't8'\n- NT66 -> 't30'\n- NT59 -> 't15'\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n- NT48 -> 't27'\n- NT90 -> 't91'\n- NT94 -> 't57'\n- NT54 -> 't16'\n- NT12 -> 't17'\u2014wait, NT12 is on the right-hand side, but does it produce anything? Or is it a non-terminal? Wait, looking at the rules, NT12 is on the right-hand side of several productions. For example, NT58 -> 't11' is a terminal. So I think the non-terminals are the left-hand sides, regardless of their production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

It's in Chomsky normal form, meaning each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or a terminal on the right.

So NT13 becomes t28 t52.\n\nPutting it all together after the first expansion:\n\nS -> t29 (NT32 becomes t27 t18) (NT68 becomes t16 t56) (NT13 becomes t28 t52)\n\nSo, after first expansion, the string is: t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t28 t52\n\nWait, no. Because S is NT88 NT26, which then becomes NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13. Expanding each:\n\nNT8 -> t29\n\nNT32 -> t27 t18\n\nNT68 -> t16 t56\n\nNT13 -> t28 t52\n\nSo S becomes t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t28 t52\n\nBut the string we are checking is longer, so I need to see if further expansions can reach the target string.\n\nWait, no, because S is two non-terminals, each expansion will produce more, but the process continues until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me write out the derivation steps more carefully.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS = NT88 NT26\n\nExpand NT88 and NT26:\n\n= NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals can be expanded further:\n\nNT8 -> t29\n\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28\n\nNT13 -> NT58 NT83\n\nSo, S becomes t29 NT73 NT42 NT54 NT28 NT58 NT83\n\nNow, let's expand the remaining non-terminals:\n\nNT73 -> 't27'\n\nNT42 -> 't18'\n\nNT54 -> 't16'\n\nNT28 -> 't56'\n\nNT58 -> 't28'\n\nNT83 -> 't52'\n\nExpanding each, S becomes: t29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t28 t52\n\nWait, but the target string is longer, with more terms. This suggests that I'm missing something because the initial expansion gives only 7 terminals, but the target has 16 terms.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, each production is two non-terminals on the left and one on the right. So each step appends more non-terminals until all are terminals. So perhaps I'm not expanding correctly.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine.\n\nWait, the initial expansion is correct: S becomes NT88 NT26, each of which expands into two non-terminals, so S becomes a sequence of four non-terminals. Then each of those can expand further, doubling the number each time until all are terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the target string is 16 tokens. So perhaps the derivation needs to go four levels deep.\n\nLet me outline the possible expansion steps:\n\nLevel 0: S (2 NTs)\nLevel 1: NT88 (2) + NT26 (2) -> 4 NTs\nLevel 2: Each NT expands to 2, so 8 NTs\nLevel 3: Each expands to 2, so 16 NTs\nLevel 4: Each expands to terminals, giving 16 terminals.\n\nWait, but the target string has 16 tokens. That suggests that after the third expansion step, we reach 16 non-terminals, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal expansion leads to a sequence that is longer, but the process continues until all are terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the expansion as a tree. Let's see.\n\nStarting with S:\n\nS expansion: NT88 NT26\n\nNow, each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nLet's model this as parse trees and see if the terminal string can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see the entire string as a series of productions. But considering the string length, it's 16 tokens, which suggests that the derivation may be 16 steps, but that doesn't make sense because each step can only expand two non-terminals into four, but each non-terminal expands into two.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of nodes. Let's think in terms of the number of steps.\n\nEach NT can be expanded, and each expansion produces two. So the number of NTs grows as follows:\n\nS: 2 NTs (level 1)\n\nAfter first expansion of S: 4 NTs\n\nAfter second expansion: 8 NTs\n\nAfter third expansion: 16 NTs\n\nAfter fourth expansion: 32 NTs\n\nBut the target string is 16 tokens, so perhaps it's after three expansions.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nEach NT production can be seen as a two-step expansion. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to construct a derivation tree.\n\nStart with S:\n\nS = NT88 NT26\n\nExpanding NT88: NT8 NT32\n\nExpanding NT26: NT68 NT13\n\nSo, S becomes NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13\n\nNow, let's expand each NT further:\n\nNT8 -> T29\n\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42 \u2192 T27 T18\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28 \u2192 T16 T56\n\nNT13 -> NT58 NT83 \u2192 T28 T52\n\nSo after all first-level expansions, S is T29 T27 T18 T16 T56 T28 T52\n\nBut the target string is \"t6 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t56 t11 t23 t23 t45 t55 t44 t38 t28 t6\"\n\nSo, in our current expansion, after S, we have T29, which is not in the target string. The target string starts with T6, so our initial expansion doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe S expands to different components.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals expand to more than two non-terminals. For example, NT48 -> NT2 NT18, which expands into two NTs. So each step adds non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first expansion.

Let me try to understand how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars are defined by a set of production rules, and each rule has a left-hand side (LHS) which is a non-terminal symbol and a right-hand side (RHS) which is a sequence of terminal and\/or non-terminal symbols. The grammar provided here consists of a bunch of rules where non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string we need to check is a sequence of terminal symbols (like t54, t60, etc.). My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is defined as `S -> NT88 NT26`. So any string generated by this grammar must start with NT88 and NT26. But in the given string, the first token is `t54`, which is a terminal. So the first part is `t54`, which suggests that NT88 or NT26 must produce `t54`. Looking at the rules, I don't see NT88 or NT26 directly producing `t54`. Wait, maybe I need to go deeper into the rules.\n\nLet me check the production rules starting from NT symbols. For example, NT41 is `NT77 NT18`. Hmm, but I'm looking for a way to get to `t54`. Maybe I should see which NTs produce `t54`.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT58: `NT33 NT4` and `NT69 NT18`. But wait, looking at the NTs, I think I need to look at symbols that eventually produce terminals, which are the ones that end with 't'. So let's see.\n\nFor example, NT77 is `NT33 NT79`, and NT99... wait, in the NTs, I don't see a NT99. Wait, looking back, I see NT58: `NT17 NT58`? No, wait, I think I need to parse the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, let's look at the rules where the RHS is a terminal or leads to terminals. For instance, NT90 is `NT91 NT68`, and then NT91 is `NT2 NT33`, which then breaks down into terminals. Wait, maybe I should see if any NTs lead directly to a terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32, and so on. But I think it's possible that some NTs can produce terminals directly. Wait, in the rules, I see that some NTs like NT48 have `NT79 NT22`? No, wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, no, the NTs that have 't's as part of their rules directly produce t's. Wait, looking for any NT that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18. Wait, but NT69 is `t27` as per the later rules. So, NT58 would be NT69 (which is t27) and NT18.\n\nWait, but in the string, I have a t54, which I need to find a path that leads to that.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should work backwards from the string to see if each term can be produced by some NT.\n\nLet's list the string tokens: `t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t55 t44 t17 t23 t47 t55 t44 t53 t28 t60`.\n\nI need to check if each term can be a result of some NT production.\n\nLet's start from the end, maybe. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can parse the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down by looking for pairs of NTs in the grammar's production rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many of the rules are A->BC, but some produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22\n- NT4 -> NT20 NT22\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n- NT68 -> NT54 NT28\n- NT22 -> NT87 NT70\n- NT70 -> NT12 NT12\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- Wait, looking for rules that produce terminals. Wait, actually, I think the rules that end with an apostrophe might be the ones that produce pure terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar is written as:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT22\n\nWait, but some have NT55 -> 't8' which indicates that NT55 produces the terminal 't8'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't36', etc.\n\nSo, any NT that has a rule ending with an apostrophe followed by something is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT7 is `-> NT59 NT58`, but I don't see a rule that produces a terminal here.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, it's written as:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\n\nBut also:\n\nNT58 -> NT69 NT18\n\nWait, but in the lines below, I see:\n\nNT58 -> NT69 NT18 -> 't54'?\n\nWait, no, maybe I need to look for NTs that have direct terminal productions. Let me scan each line of the grammar.\n\nLine 1: S -> NT88 NT26\n\nLines 2-32 contain various rules. For example:\n\nNT58 -> NT69 NT18\n\nBut then below it says:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\n\nWait, not directly, it's part of the same NT58 rule. Wait, no, looking again, each line after the NT definition has a rule for that NT. Wait, no. Each NT is defined on a separate line, each with a production or a terminal if it's a terminal.\n\nWait, the grammar is a long list where each line is an NT followed by its possible productions.\n\nWait, maybe looking for any rules where the RHS is a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT72 -> 't44'\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n- NT55 -> 't52'\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n- NT55 -> 't54'\n- NT48 -> 't27'\n- NT11 -> 't21'\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT7 -> 't2'\n- NT70 -> 't11'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT42 -> 't18'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT32 -> 't25'\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n- NT87 -> 't35'\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT72 -> 't33'\n- NT76 -> 't55'\n- NT22 -> 't44' (appears again)\n- NT41 -> 't49'\n- NT20 -> 't20' (probably a typo, but assuming NT20 -> 't20')\nWait, but looking through the list, I see several lines where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n- NT55 -> 't52'\n- NT55 -> 't54'\n- NT48 -> 't27'\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n- NT35 -> 't44' (wait, does NT35 have a production? Let me check: yes, line 15: NT35 -> 't44')\n- NT53 -> 't48'\n- NT72 -> 't33'\n- NT76 -> 't55' (but how? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar.

Let me scan all rules again. I see rules for NT48, NT17, etc., but no NT8 being a non-terminal. That's confusing because all other non-terminals have defined productions. So, perhaps NT8 is a terminal. But none of the string parts are 't8'. The string has 't54', 't60', etc.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I do see NT8 -> 't29' in rule 42, and also NT17 -> 't29' in rule 17. So either NT8 can produce 't29' or NT17 can. So if NT8 is a terminal, that's fine.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought NT88 expands to NT8 NT32. If NT8 is a terminal, then NT88 would be NT8 (which is a terminal) and NT32 (a non-terminal). So, in the string, the first part should be a terminal, which in the string is 't54', 't60', etc. But I'm confused because the string starts with 't54', which may not correspond to NT8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step. Sometimes, parsing strings with CNF grammars can be tricky, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is particularly useful for parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But since the question is about determining membership, maybe I can use a top-down or bottom-up approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that all the productions except for some NTT rules have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. But wait, I also see that some have a mix of non-terminals and terminals, like NT98 -> NT41 NT40. But wait, according to CNF, all productions should have only non-terminals or a single terminal. Hmm, this might be a typo or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, actually, looking closely, most of the productions are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for a few that have NTx -> a, which is fine, because in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the grammar seems to be in CNF because each rule has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t6 t27 t18 t16 t56 t36 t47 t55 t44 t53 t1 t17 t23 t23 t23 t44 t60.\n\nWait, let me parse that. The string has a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. So each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers are likely codes for non-terminals. The string is a sequence of these 't' symbols connected by the grammar rules.\n\nSo, the string is: t6 t27 t18 t16 t56 t36 t47 t55 t44 t53 t1 t17 t23 t23 t23 t44 t60.\n\nWait, that's quite a long string. 17 terminals in total. Now, my task is to see whether this string can be derived by the grammar.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to construct the parsing table using CYK, as that's a standard method for CNF grammars. But given the time, maybe I can spot some patterns or see if the string can be built starting from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, let's look at the first few symbols of the string: t6 t27. If the start symbol S is NT88 NT26, then the first part of the string should come from NT88 and the second part from NT26.\n\nWait, let me write that down:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo, the entire string must be the concatenation of something derived from NT88 and something derived from NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t6 and the second is t27. Now, let's check what productions can derive t6 and t27.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce either t6 or t27.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT72 \u2192 t44, NT50\u2192t38, NT58\u2192t28, NT48\u2192t27, NT57\u2192t57 (wait, looking at the given grammar, I see NT48 \u2192 t27. So that's one. So, for example, if a non-terminal NT88 can produce t6 and something else, and NT26 can produce t27 and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the rules where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT48 \u2192 t27\n- NT58 \u2192 t28\n- NT7 \u2192 t29\n- NT17 \u2192 t29\n- NT8 \u2192 t29\n- NT18 \u2192 t47\n- NT91 \u2192 t44\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT9 \u2192 t6?

Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given in CNF, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and B and C are either non-terminals or terminals. Additionally, the start symbol is S, and it's divided into NT segments (like NT63, NT26, etc.) and a few terminals represented by 't' followed by a number and some others as single terminals like 't26'. The string to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms and others: t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t34 t26 t55 t44 t38 t1 t23 t17 t57 t33 t44 t60.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, the right-hand side of each production has exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol's initial expansion which can have just one. However, in this case, looking at the productions, each production seems to have exactly two non-terminals except for some that end with a terminal. Wait, no, actually, some productions go from a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal. Hmm, but in the grammar provided, I see that a lot of rules have two non-terminals, but others have a mix or even a single non-terminal. Wait, no\u2014the CNF requires that each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So perhaps some of these rules might have just one, but looking at the given grammar, like NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, which is fine, but others like NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4, which is also okay because both are non-terminals. Wait, no, the grammar seems to have some variations. Wait, actually, looking back, no, all the productions in CNF should have two non-terminals on the right. But in this grammar, for example, NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48. Wait, 22 and 48 are both non-terminals, so that's fine. Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, all the productions are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which is correct. Additionally, some of the NT rules have a 't' as their right-hand side, like NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33 is okay because 't2' is a terminal, but wait, wait, in CNF, the productions can have just one non-terminal, but in our case, no. Wait, no, because the given grammar includes rules where a non-terminal is expanded into a terminal and another non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me check: looking at the grammar, for example, NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33, but also NT75 \u2192 NT33 NT79, etc. So all the productions have exactly two non-terminals on the right side. So that's correct for CNF.\n\nWait, but some rules have a mix. For example, looking at NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, which is two non-terminals. Okay, that's fine. Wait, actually, looking through all the rules, every production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So that's correct for CNF.\n\nNow, to check if the string is generated by this grammar. The string is a series of terminal symbols obtained by some expansion of the start symbol S. So let me see the length of the string: t6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t34, t26, t55, t44, t38, t1, t23, t17, t57, t33, t44, t60. So that's 18 symbols, all of which are terminals, except maybe t23, etc. Wait, no, all are terminals because the grammar's rules are in CNF with terminals being 't' followed by digits or specific letters like 't26', etc. So the process is to find a parse tree where the leaves are these terminals.\n\nGiven that, I think I can approach this by trying to work backwards, starting from the string and seeing if it can be broken down into the grammar's productions. Alternatively, I can consider the sequence and try to see if each step can expand a non-terminal that leads to the given terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the derivation process step by step. But with the string being 18 symbols long, that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way into the string by looking for matching productions. For example, the string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t6. Looking through the rule list, NT88 \u2192 t8, t32. No, wait, NT18 \u2192 t47. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, let me look for any rules where a non-terminal directly produces t6.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT56 \u2192 NT..., etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all non-terminal rules and see which ones produce t6.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT12 NT12 (so it's recursive, but that can't produce a terminal)\n- NT66 \u2192 t30\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT44 \u2192 NT24 (no, wait, not in the given rules)\nWait, perhaps better to list all rules:\n\nWait, each non-terminal rule is a production. Each of these rules when applied in the derivation will expand a non-terminal into two non-terminals. So, if somewhere in the string, we have 't6' as a terminal, that must be the result of a non-terminal A that has a rule A \u2192 t6 X or X t6, but in the given grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce a t6?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where the right-hand side includes t6 as the first or second element.

Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the list, I see that some rules have 't' as the first part, like NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72.\n\nWait, what about NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58? No, that's 't59' and 't58'.\n\nWait, maybe looking for rules that result in 't6' as one of the symbols.\n\nWait, looking through, for example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72\nSo, NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22 \u2192 NT51 NT72 NT22, which might eventually produce terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it by looking for the given string and working backwards, trying to see if each segment can derive from a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build from S and see if the string can be matched.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in CNF, each step adds exactly one new non-terminal, so the number of symbols in the string corresponds to the derivation steps.\n\nWait, but building step by step is time-consuming. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a series of steps where each symbol is derived from some non-terminal's production.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to note that the grammar's rules may not contain any way to produce certain sequences.\n\nLooking at the given string: t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t34 t26 t55 t44 t38 t1 t23 t17 t57 t33 t44 t60.\n\nHmm, perhaps looking for when 't1' appears.\n\nWait, 't1' is only in NT33: NT33 \u2192 t1 (or looking through the rules: No, wait, no rule produces t1 as a terminal, except possibly NT33 \u2192 t1. Let me confirm: looking at the rules, yes, NT33 \u2192 t1.\n\nSo if 't1' is in the string, that corresponds to NT33. So perhaps the string ends with 't1' followed by 't23'.

The grammar provided seems to have a mix, but I might have missed some. Anyway, the approach should still work.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminal symbols (t or t followed by numbers). The grammar has productions that either produce t's or other non-terminals. So, the string must be generated by expanding the start symbol S step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nLet me list out all the terminals and their productions. For example, NT88 produces t8 and NT32, and NT32 produces t32 and NT42, etc. Wait, the grammar actually seems more complex because many NT symbols have two non-terminals as their productions, and some directly produce terminals.\n\nI need to check how the string can be broken down into these productions. Each step in the derivation would replace a non-terminal with either two other non-terminals or a terminal. The given string has 20 tokens, so the derivation must create 20 terminal symbols, which would require 19 steps because each production can increase the number of symbols by one.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the first symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-329","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and it's in CNF, which means each production rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That should help because parsing algorithms like CYK might be applicable, but since I might not have to write code, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t28 t60`. That's 19 tokens, so I should check if this can derive from S, which has the production S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo the first step is to see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S step by step. Let's see: S is split into two parts, NT88 and NT26. Each of these must generate their respective parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT88 is a non-terminal, so it must be expanded further. From the grammar, I recall that NT88 is not listed directly, but wait, in the productions, looking through the NT... -> ... rules, I see NT88 isn't listed among the NT rules. Wait, that's strange. Or maybe it's a terminal. Looking back: Oh, no, the rules are for the non-terminals. Wait, looking through the productions, I see rules for NT58, NT88, etc. Wait, actually, in the initial list, the productions are all like NTxy -> ... So S -> NT88 NT26, meaning that NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals that must be expanded. But in the provided grammar, NT88 isn't among the non-terminals; wait, no, looking at the production list, all the non-terminals are NT prefixes, and some of them are defined, but I don't see NT88 being defined as a production. Wait, that can't be right because S is defined as NT88 NT26, but if NT88 isn't a non-terminal that can produce anything else, that implies it's a terminal? But that's not the case because in the string, we have t6, t18, etc., which are terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Let me double-check the grammar. The grammar has productions like NT63 -> NT48 NT87, etc. But after looking through all the productions, I realize that the only NT's that have terminal strings are those that directly map to 't' followed by a number, like NT7 -> 't4', NT11 -> 't4', NT8 -> 't29', etc. So actually, some of the non-terminals are terminals, but in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but S is defined as NT88 NT26. If NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals but don't have any productions, that's a problem. That suggests that NT88 and NT26 cannot be expanded further, so they must themselves be terminals. But in the string provided, the first token is 't6', so maybe NT88 is 't6' and NT26 is something else. Let me check the grammar rules for NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT88 is not directly listed in any production as a non-terminal that produces something. Wait, in the provided list, all the non-terminals are things like NT63, NT48, etc. I don't see NT88 or NT26 as non-terminals; instead, the ones that end with \"88\" or \"26\" are not present. Wait, actually, looking again, the production S -> NT88 NT26 is the start, but in the list, I don't see NT88 -> ... or NT26 -> ... So that's confusing because in CNF, all non-terminals must have productions that expand to other symbols. So perhaps S cannot produce anything because NT88 and NT26 can't be expanded, meaning the grammar as given doesn't generate any strings, which can't be right because the string provided is a sequence of 't's and numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go back. The grammar is:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nNT63 -> NT48 NT87\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nWait, so NT26 is defined as NT68 NT13. That makes sense. Similarly, NT88, if I look, I don't see it in the definitions, so perhaps NT88 is a terminal. But in the string, the first token is 't6', so maybe NT88 is 't6', and NT26 is 't60'? Or something else. Wait, but I need to see if S can produce the entire string.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string is in terms of 't' followed by numbers, perhaps each NT production ultimately produces one of these 't' rules. For instance, NT7 -> 't4', NT13 -> 't27', etc. So perhaps the string represents the terminals generated by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nGiven that, let's see the string: t6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t25, t30, t44, t16, t56, t20, t9, t20, t44, t55, t44, t38, t28, t60.\n\nThat's 18 tokens, wait, but the string as written has 19 tokens. Wait, let me count again: the string is \"t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t28 t60\". That's 19 't' tokens. But S is NT88 NT26, which would generate two parts. Wait, but each part is a sequence of 't's, but the entire string has 19 tokens, which is an odd number, which is a problem because each expansion from a non-terminal produces two parts, so the number of symbols should be a power of two, but 19 isn't a power of two, nor can it be constructed by combining two such expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Each production rule is applied recursively. For example, S -> NT88 NT26. If each non-terminal can be further expanded, the total number of terminals will be 2^k, where k is the number of productions applied. So for example, if S expands to NT88 NT26, and each NT88 and NT26 then expand, the number of terminals would be 2*2=4, or 2*1 + 1*2=6, depending on how they're expanded.\n\nBut the given string has 19 tokens, which is an odd number, which doesn't fit the pattern of a binary expansion (powers of two). So is 19 a possible result? Well, let's see. Let's think: each non-terminal production adds two symbols, but in this case, the S produces two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Each of these could produce sequences, but for the entire string to be generated, the concatenation of the expansions of NT88 and NT26 must equal the given string.\n\nBut wait, if the string is \"t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t28 t60\", that's 19 tokens. So the string length is 19. But since S must split into two parts, the first part could have, say, m tokens, and the second part n tokens, with m + n =19. But 19 is odd, so one part is even and the other is odd, which isn't possible because all expansions in Chomsky Normal Form produce even numbers of symbols when fully expanded (since each non-terminal splits into two). Therefore, the total length should be a power of two. But 19 isn't a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar. So the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can also go directly to a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Let me look through the productions. The start symbol is S, and it produces NT88 and NT26. So S \u2192 NT88 NT26. I'll have to see which parts of the string correspond to these.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t followed by numbers. Each of these corresponds to parts of the non-terminals. So, for example, 't6' comes from NT66, 't60' from NT60, etc. I need to map each token in the string to a non-terminal and see if they follow the grammar rules.\n\nLooking closer, the grammar has several NTs and some directly produce terminals. For example, NT72 \u2192 't32', so t32 is a terminal. Similarly, other NTs produce various terminals. The string includes t6, t60, etc. These might correspond to specific NTs.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. The first token is t6. Looking at the grammar, which NTs produce t6? Scanning the productions, I see NT72 \u2192 t32, NT75 \u2192 t60, NT51 \u2192 t39, NT2 \u2192 t36, NT91 \u2192 t44, etc. Wait, I need to find an NT that produces t6. Let me check. Oh, I see NT72 \u2192 t32, NT75 \u2192 t60, NT51 \u2192 t39, NT2 \u2192 t36, NT91 \u2192 t44. Wait, no NT directly produces t6. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let me go through the NTs again.\n\nLooking for NTs that produce t6. Let's check each production that ends with t6. Wait, I see in the grammar, no NT directly produces t6. Wait, but the string starts with t6, which is a terminal. If none of the NTs directly produce t6, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Because every non-terminal must expand into other symbols until only terminals remain. So if none of the NTs can produce t6, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t6, which suggests that the first production is NT6 \u2192 t6, but looking at the grammar, that's not the case. Let me check again. Oh, looking at the list: NT28 \u2192 't56', NT40 \u2192 't6', is that correct? Wait, no, looking at the grammar entries, the production NT40 \u2192 't6'. Yes, that's there. NT40 \u2192 t6. So NT40 can produce t6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that t6 is 't6', which might be an indicator. Wait, maybe the terminals are labeled as t1, t2, etc., so t6 is a terminal from NT40. So for the string to start with \"t6\", the first non-terminal must expand into t6. So perhaps the first part is from NT40: NT40 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo the first symbol is t6, meaning NT40 produces t6.\n\nSo the first part is NT40, which goes to t6. Now, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S starts with NT88 and NT26. So the first symbol in the string should come from either NT88 or NT26. But the string starts with t6, which comes from NT40. That seems conflicting unless I'm misunderstanding the order.\n\nWait, perhaps the start is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the entire string is a concatenation of NT88's derivation and NT26's derivation. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT88 expands to and what NT26 expands to.\n\nSo let's parse the string into two parts: the first half and the second half, corresponding to NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, the string is `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t38 t45 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t8 t60`, which is 20 symbols. If NT88 and NT26 produce different lengths, that might complicate things. But perhaps each NT expands into the same number of symbols. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is the expansion of S, so each NT in the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 must expand into a part of the string.\n\nBut the string is too long for that. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a direct concatenation of the terminals from NT88 and NT26, meaning that each NT must produce a terminal, but in this case, the string consists of multiple terminals, so each might be generated by a single NT or through expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the string as a sequence of productions. Let me start by thinking that the entire string is generated by the grammar. So starting from S \u2192 NT88 NT26, each NT must generate a substring, and together they form the entire string.\n\nLet me try to split the string into two parts, assuming that NT88 generates the first part and NT26 generates the second part. Let's see how long the string is. The string has 20 terms. Suppose each NT expands to 10 terms each. So NT88 would generate the first 10, NT26 the next 10.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each NT must produce a single terminal, but the string shows 20 terms, which would require the grammar to have 20 non-terminals, which it doesn't. So that approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the string is not directly mapped one-to-one to the productions of S, but each term in the string could be a combination of NTs expanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a non-terminal that produces that t. For example, t6 is produced by NT40, t60 by NT60, etc.\n\nSo each token in the string represents a non-terminal symbol, so the entire string is a series of non-terminals that must be connected by productions.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the string is a sequence of terminals, each of which corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. So each 't6' in the string is the result of NT40 producing 't6', which is the terminal. So each token is a terminal, so the entire sequence is a possible derivation in the grammar.\n\nBut in that case, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, all expansions are non-terminals producing two non-terminals, except terminals. So the given string has to be a complete reduction of the grammar without any unresolved non-terminals.\n\nWait, so in the string, each token is a terminal generated by a non-terminal. So the entire string must be a valid path in the grammar where all NTs are expanded into the terminals.\n\nSo each token in the string is a terminal, which comes from a non-terminal expansion. So the string is a sequence of terminals, so the derivation would start with the start symbol S, which undergoes productions leading to these terminals.\n\nTo check this, I need to see if the entire string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals that follow the grammar rules, eventually expanding into the given terminals.\n\nBut this is a bit abstract. Maybe a better approach is to see if the given string can be a sentential form of the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to reverse engineer the string. Let me map each token to the NT it comes from. For example:\n\nt6 \u2192 NT40\n\nt60 \u2192 NT60\n\nt52 \u2192 NT52\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, which NTs produce which terminals. For example:\n\nNT40 \u2192 t6\n\nNT13 \u2192 t12, t27, etc.\n\nWait, I need to make a list of which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nLet me try to list each NT and the terminals they produce:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t2, t24\n\n- NT67 \u2192 maybe not, I don't see it in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through each production and note the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 t60\n\n- NT72 \u2192 t32\n\n- NT75 \u2192 t60\n\n- Wait, no, I need to find all NTs and their replacements.\n\nLooking through each production line:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\n2. NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\n\n3. NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\n4.

Hmm, CNF means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side, right? Or wait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, I see a mix of both. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the grammar has rules like S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which are two non-terminals, so that's in CNF. Then there's NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, which is two non-terminals. But some rules terminate with terminals, like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\u2014that's non-terminals. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I see some rules where the right side includes a mix, like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, that's two non-terminals, so that's fine. But looking again, some rules have a terminal, like NT72 \u2192 NT33 NT48. Wait, no, actually NT48 is a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, I need to see if any of the rules have a terminal on the right side. Oh, no, actually, looking at the grammar, all the productions on the right side are non-terminals except for the ones explicitly terminating. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, for example, NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22, NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22, NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70, etc. But wait, are any of these ending with a terminal? Wait, no, for example, NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83, which are both non-terminals. Wait, but looking through, I see rules like NT98 -> NT41 NT40, which are non-terminals, but some other rules have a mix? Or maybe not. Wait, in the given grammar, I think everything on the right is non-terminals except for some specific ones in the later part. Let me check each rule.\n\nWait, looking back, I think some of the rules are using terminals, like NT98 -> NT41 NT40, which are both non-terminals. Wait, no, perhaps all right-hand sides are two non-terminals except for the ones where they have 't' followed by a number, which are terminals. For example, in some rules, like NT40 -> 't6', NT54 -> 't16', etc. Oh, I see now. So some of the non-terminals produce a terminal symbol. So the grammar allows for some terminals in the right-hand side.\n\nSo each rule either is two non-terminals (like A \u2192 BC) or a non-terminal producing a single terminal (A \u2192 a). So that's in Chomsky normal form.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of t's and numbers, all separated by spaces. The task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite extensive, I need to find a way to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me start by listing the string:\n\nt54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t52 t60\n\nThat's 20 tokens. So the string is a sequence of 20 symbols, each presumably corresponding to a production step.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the parsing can be done as a series of steps where each step either consumes a terminal or expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals.\n\nTo see if the string is in the language, I can try to see if it can be fully consumed by a leftmost derivation using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is a context-free grammar, I can attempt to parse the string by looking for possible substrings that match productions, starting from the beginning.\n\nLet me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the overall string is:\n\nt54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t52 t60\n\nI need to see how this can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nSince the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26, the initial expansion would produce two non-terminals, so the string should start with the first part matching NT88 and the second part matching NT26.\n\nLooking at the string's first token, it's t54. So I need to see if any of the non-terminals derive t54 as the first symbol, and another non-terminal that can derive the rest.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar rules:\n\nLooking for rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal and the right-hand side (RHS) includes a production that starts with t54.\n\nLooking through the RHS of various rules, I spot rules that produce t16, t27, etc. Wait, perhaps I should look more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\n- NT98 \u2192 NT41 NT40\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT54 \u2192 't16'\n- NT69 \u2192 't27'\n- NT90 \u2192 't56'\n- NT72 \u2192 't33'\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the rules where RHS starts with a terminal: but actually, in the given grammar, the RHS doesn't have any terminals except in specific rules.

{"custom_id":"request-365","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it limits the structure of the productions to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t54 t27 t18 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t17 t17 t1 t16 t56 t20 t49 t60 t55 t44 t38 t28 t6`. \n\nFirst, I notice that all the elements in this string are terminals (they start with 't' followed by numbers). The non-terminals in the grammar are things like S, NT63, NT26, etc., and the only terminals are strings starting with 't'. So, the string only has terminals, which means each 't' must correspond to a production rule that results in a terminal symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S, so the first step is to look at the first production rule of S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. But wait, looking at the provided rules, the first line is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Hmm, but in the initial productions listed, the user wrote S -> NT88 NT26, and then other NT rules follow. \n\nWait, no, the first line is indeed S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S can only produce two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. But the string starts with t54, which is a terminal. So that would mean that the first non-terminal in the derivation (either NT88 or NT26) must produce t54 somehow. Let me check if either NT88 or NT26 has a production that results in t54.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT88 is defined as NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. The terminal for NT8 is t29, and NT32 is t56. Wait, no: looking back, the grammar has rules like NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT32 \u2192 t56 because in the later lines, NT32 is followed by '\u2192 t56'. So NT32 \u2192 t56.\n\nWait, so if NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT8 \u2192 t29. NT32 \u2192 t56. So NT88 can produce t29 t56. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string would have to be 't29 t56', but the string starts with 't54 t27...'. Therefore, NT88 can't be the starting point for the first symbol since it can only produce t29 and t56, but here the first symbol is t54, which is different.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me look again. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. But in the provided rules, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and other NT non-terminals have their own productions. So the first step is to see if NT88 or NT26 can produce the first token in the string, which is t54.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. NT8 is 't29', and NT32 is 't56' (since in the later lines, NT32 \u2192 t56). So NT88 can only produce t29 t56, which would make the first two symbols in the string to be t29 t56. But the string starts with t54, which doesn't match. So that would mean that NT88 isn't the starting point, which is a problem because S must start with NT88 NT26.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the initial rule. Let me check the grammar again. The first production is S -> NT88 NT26. Yes, that's correct. So S produces NT88 and NT26. So the first two symbols in the string must come from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo the first symbol is t54, which would have to come from NT88, but as we saw earlier, NT88 \u2192 t29 t56. Therefore, t54 can't be produced by NT88. That's a problem. Unless... wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking at the rules again, perhaps there's another production for NT88. Let me scan through all the rules for NT88. The first line is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then I see NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4, etc. So no, NT88 doesn't have any other production except NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nTherefore, the first symbol in the string must be t29, but it's t54. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check again. The NT88 is defined as per the initial rules as S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then, looking through the NT rules:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nThen, NT8 \u2192 't29' because in the later rules, there's NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, NT32 \u2192 t56, etc. Wait, perhaps the NT88's productions are only the one stated. So NT88 can only generate t29 and t56, meaning the first symbol in the string should be t29, not t54.\n\nTherefore, since the string starts with t54, it can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-366","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by trying to understand the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The top symbol is S, and the right-hand side of each rule consists of two non-terminals except for some which produce a terminal or a combination that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t27 t18 t16 t56 t30 t36 t1 t16 t25 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t52 t6`.\n\nI notice that most of the symbols here are terminals except for a few like NT63, NT26, etc. Wait, no, actually, the grammar's non-terminals are all in NT, but when they expand, they can sometimes produce a string of terminals or a single terminal. The right-hand side of each production is a combination of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of the rules produce terminals. For example, NT7 -> NT11 NT22, but NT11 itself can go to 't4' or other rules. Hmm. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, some of the right-hand sides of the non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example, NT7 -> 't27'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't36', NT91 -> 't44', etc. So each non-terminal can expand into either two more non-terminals or into a single terminal.\n\nThe string provided has a sequence of t followed by numbers, which suggests that the terminals are these tX forms. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and we need to see if it can be derived starting from S.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from the beginning, trying to match each terminal step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt54, t27, t18, t16, t56, t30, t36, t1, t16, t25, t20, t9, t20, t44, t55, t44, t38, t27, t30, t52, t6.\n\nWait, that's 21 terminals. Let me count: 21 items, so length is 21.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S -> NT88 NT26, each application of a rule on the left will produce two parts, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals. But wait, in this case, the grammar seems to have some non-terminals that produce multiple terminals. For example, NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Maybe each production in the grammar is such that it can produce one or more terminals.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived by the non-terminals and their combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string backward to see if it can be generated by the grammar. Sometimes, starting from the end is easier, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial step. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. So the first step would have two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Therefore, the string must be structured as a sequence generated by NT88 and then NT26, each of which produces a part of the string.\n\nSo the string starts with 't54', so let's see what the rules for NT88 produce. Looking at the grammar, I see NT88 -> NT88 (something?) Wait, no, let me look.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32.\n\nSo NT88 can be expanded into NT8 followed by NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo S -> NT88 NT26 would produce something like (NT8)(NT26). The string starts with t54, which I need to see how that could be generated.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I should make a list of all the rules to see which non-terminals directly generate each terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't27'\n\nNT48 -> 't27' (twice)\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT91 -> 't44'\n\nNT18 -> 't47'\n\nNT12 -> 't17'\n\nNT12 -> 't23'\n\nNT72 -> 't32'\n\nNT72 -> 't23'\n\nNT42 -> 't18'\n\nNT11 -> 't17'\n\nNT40 -> 't60'\n\nNT73 -> 't60'\n\nWait, no, I think I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the rules, some of them directly produce a single terminal. For example:\n\nNT7 -> 't27'\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT48 -> 't27' (twice)\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\n\nNT17 -> 't29'\n\nNT18 -> 't47'\n\nNT12 -> 't17'\n\nNT72 -> 't32'\n\nNT72 -> 't23' (hmm, same one as above?)\n\nWait no, perhaps I should list all the non-terminals that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT7 -> 't27'\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\n\nNT17 -> 't29'\n\nNT18 -> 't47' (is this correct?)\n\nWait, no. Looking back, for example:\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18, so that doesn't produce a terminal. But NT48 -> 't27' appears twice, so that's a direct terminal.\n\nSimilarly, let's go through each non-terminal that appears in the right-hand side as a terminal:\n\nHere's a list I think I can make from the given grammar:\n\nNT7 -> 't27'\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\n\nNT17 -> 't29'\n\nNT18 -> 't47'\n\nNT12 -> 't17'\n\nNT22 -> 't44' (wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT22 -> 't44' appears in one rule.\n\nWait, no, looking back, the rules have NT22 on the left side, but the right-hand side for NT91 is NT18 (which could go to 't47' maybe). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a reverse mapping from terminal to production.\n\nLet me list each terminal and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n'NT7 -> 't27''\n\n'NT2 -> 't36''\n\n'NT48 -> 't27''\n\nSo t27 can come from NT7 or NT48.\n\nLooking for the string, the first terminal is 't54'. Hmm, is there any production rule that gives 't54'? Looking at the rules, no, I don't see any non-terminal NT producing 't54' directly. So that's a problem. Because if the first terminal is 't54', it must be produced by some non-terminal. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly gives 't54'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the right-hand sides for terminals.\n\nNT rules:\n\nWait, for example, NT59 -> 't15' and some others.\n\nWait, let me go through all the rules:\n\nNT7 -> 't27'\n\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\n\nNT17 -> 't29'\n\nNT18 -> 't47'\n\nNT12 -> 't17'\n\nNT22 -> 't44'\n\nNT42 -> 't18'\n\nWait, no, looking back, no. NT91 is 't44' when you expand it.\n\nWait, no, looking through all the rules, it's possible that some produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each rule again.\n\nLet me list all NT rules and see if any produce terminals:\n\n1. S -> NT88 NT26\n2. NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n3. NT26 -> NT68 NT13\n4. NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n5.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That should make things a bit easier because CNF is conducive to parsing, and I can maybe use a method like the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language, but since I'm just evaluating manually, I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules to have a clear idea of the structure. The start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. Each of those (NT88, NT26) should then be expanded further until we reach terminal symbols, which are all the t followed by a number, except for some that are single letters like 't27' or 't28'. Wait, actually looking back, I see that some NT productions are mapped to 'tX', so those are the terminals. For example, NT72 -> 't32', etc.\n\nSo the string starts with t54, which I need to see if it's a terminal. Looking through the production rules, I see that NT54 is defined as 't16'. So t54 corresponds to NT54. Next is t60, which comes from NT60 -> 't56' and then NT56 -> 't60'. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check each component one by one.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S. Let's see. The start symbol S expands into NT88 NT26. So the root of the parse tree would be S, with two children NT88 and NT26. Each of these needs to be expanded into terminal symbols or further non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT88: according to the rules, NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So NT88 branches into NT8 and NT32. NT32 appears in the string as t32? Wait, no, the string has t48, t33, etc. Wait, no, looking at the string, the first few are t54, t60, t52, t18, t16, t25, t30, t56, t11, t23, t23, t9, t23, t17, t57, t33, t44, t55, t44, t53, t28, t60.\n\nWait, t32 is not in the string. Let me check the rules again. NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So for the NT88, the expansion would require NT8 and NT32 to be part of the derivation. But the string starts with t54, which is the terminal for NT54, not NT8 or NT32. Hmm, that's a problem because NT8 hasn't been mentioned as a terminal, but perhaps it's a non-terminal that needs further expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all the NT symbols and their corresponding terminals or other NTs. Let's create a list:\n\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT70 -> NT12 NT12\n- NT66 -> NT30 NT30\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT72 -> NT32 NT48\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT55 -> 't18'\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- NT90 -> 't56'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n- NT97 -> 't4'\n- NT94 -> 't57'\n- NT51 -> NT39\n- NT32 -> NT73 NT42\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT50\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT69\n- NT28 -> NT56 NT18\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58\n- NT70 -> NT12 NT12\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT73 -> 't27'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT72 -> 't32'\n- NT41 -> NT77 NT18\n- NT13 -> NT58 NT83\n- NT14 -> NT66 NT90\n- NT13 -> NT85 NT40\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58\n- NT48 -> NT59 NT98\n- NT7 -> NT87 NT97\n- NT87 -> NT76 NT35\n- NT90 -> 't91' (Wait, no, looking back, NT90 might map to something else.

Now, each of these needs to be further expanded until terminals are reached.\n\nLooking at NT8: I don't see any production for NT8 in the given rules. So that's a problem because the string starts with t54, which maps to NT54, but S's expansion doesn't include NT54. So maybe the parse tree is not the way to go, or perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a linear sequence of terminals, so I need to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar step by step, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string needs to be a left or right sentential form generated by the grammar. But since it's a sequence of terminals, perhaps we can think of it as a leftmost derivation.\n\nSo the string is: t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t56 t11 t23 t23 t9 t23 t17 t57 t33 t44 t55 t44 t53 t28 t60\n\nIt's actually 22 tokens, which is a bit lengthy.\n\nLet me start by considering the first few symbols to see if they can come from S.\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nSo now, S expands to NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13.\n\nEach of these needs to be expanded:\n\nNT8: Looking through production rules, does NT8 have any rules?

Wait, perhaps I can track through the possible derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead check each symbol in the string to see if it's present in the terminals of the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-380","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has productions where each non-terminal generates exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar provided. All the productions are in CNF: each rule has two non-terminals on the left and right, except for those ending with terminals. For example, S -> NT88 NT26, which leads to terminals when the non-terminals resolve down.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t16 t56 t30 t44 t16 t56 t17 t23 t23 t23 t9 t17 t23 t23 t23 t44 t55 t44 t38 t28 t6`.\n\nWait, I notice that some of the \"t\" terms are single letters, like t37, t16, etc. In the grammar, these letters correspond directly to terminal symbols because each production that ends with a terminal is a single character. So for instance, NT7 -> t2 is possible because in the grammar, NT7->NT11 NT22, and so on, until it resolves to 't2'.\n\nBut in the string, each t followed by numbers is a terminal symbol. Let me see how these t symbols are generated in the grammar. Let's check some of them:\n\n- t37 seems to come from NT86 -> t9, but wait, NT86 isn't directly a terminal. Looking back, NT56 is a terminal, and so is t56, but t37 is in the string. Checking the grammar, NT86 isn't a production. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the grammar defines NT58 -> NT33 NT4, and so on. Wait, maybe I should list all the productions that produce terminals to better understand.\n\nLet me go through the grammar and note which NTs produce terminals and their corresponding t's.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT98 -> NT41 NT40, but then NT41 -> NT77 NT18, NT77->NT33 NT79, etc. Eventually, I see that some productions directly end with 't' symbols. For example:\n\nNT90 -> NT91 NT68, and NT91->NT2 NT33, NT2->t36? Wait, looking at NT2's productions, NT2->NT87 NT70, and NT70->NT12 NT12, then NT12->t17, so NT2 resolves to t36.\n\nSimilarly, NT7->t2, NT13->t12, etc.\n\nSo each terminal like t37, t16, etc., comes from specific NT productions. Wait, t37 in the string\u2014does any NT in the grammar resolve to t37? Let's check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32. NT8 is a terminal: NT8->t29.\n\nWait, but then NT88 would be NT29 (from NT8) and NT32, which is NT32. Check NT32: NT32->NT73 NT42. NT73->t75, NT42->t18. So NT32->t75 t18, which combine to 't75t18'. But in the string, we have t37, which isn't here. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check NT32 in the grammar. Oh, NT32->NT73 NT42. Then NT73->t75, and NT42->t18. But where does t37 come from? Maybe looking at NT40, which is a terminal. NT40->t6, so that's 't6' in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps t37 is part of a longer path that I'm not seeing. Let me try to decode each t in the string to see which non-terminals they come from.\n\nStarting from the first t:\n\n1. t37: Looking for a rule that produces t37. Let's see, is there any NT that directly produces t37? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT productions ending with t37. So perhaps it's derived from a chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, so t37 must come from a production chain starting from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t37. Let's see where t37 is in the grammar. Checking each production, I see NT86, but looking in the grammar, does any NT produce t37?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar to be thorough.\n\n- NT85 -> NT17 NT58\n- NT17-> NT63 NT50\n- NT63 -> NT48 NT87\n- NT87-> NT76 NT35\n- NT76-> t56, perhaps?\n\nWait, so let's trace the chain for t37.\n\nWait, let me check other terminals. Let's see, for example, NT58 -> NT33 NT4. Wait, NT33->t1, so that's part of a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each t in the string corresponds to a specific NT rule. For example, t37 is produced by NT58, as per NT58->t6, but no\u2014NT58 is a product that resolves to t11 and t18.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t37, which must correspond to a production of NT37, but in the grammar, there is no NT37. So maybe t37 is a result of multiple steps. Alternatively, perhaps the string contains t37 where the grammar doesn't generate t37 as a terminal. So that would mean it's not possible for the grammar to produce t37, so the answer would be No.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should approach this methodically. Let's start from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut S is S -> NT88 NT26. So the string would have to start with the first symbol generated by NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string: `t37 t16 t56 t30 t44 t16 t56 t17 t23 t23 t23 t9 t17 t23 t23 t23 t44 t55 t44 t38 t28 t6`\n\nWe can think of this as a sequence of symbols produced by the grammar. Each symbol must be either a terminal or derived from non-terminals, which themselves may generate more symbols.\n\nFirst, let's process each step:\n\n1. The first symbol is t37. Since it's a terminal, we need to find a production that results in t37. Looking through the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce t37? Checking all production rules, I don't see any NT -> t37. So t37 must come from a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and I'm not seeing the correct chain. Maybe t37 comes from a longer chain, but without a direct rule, it's not possible. So the string would be invalid because t37 can't be derived from any NT.\n\nBut wait, let me check the grammar again carefully. Scanning the grammar rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t37. So that would mean the string cannot be generated because the first symbol t37 has no corresponding production in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I missed a rule. Let's go through the grammar list and see if any NT ends with 37.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nYes, NT58->t18, which comes from NT58 -> NT33 NT4.\n\nSo t33 is a terminal? Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine whether any NT directly produces t37.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT98->t41 t40, but those are terminals?\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar lines more carefully. For example, NT98->NT41 NT40, but NT41 is a non-terminal because it has further productions. Oh wait, no\u2014the productions in the grammar might mix terminals and non-terminals. Wait, no: in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A->BC or A->a, where a is a terminal. So each production in the given grammar must either have two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo in the given grammar, any non-terminal on the right must be a terminal unless it's supposed to be a comma-separated list. Wait, let's check the productions:\n\nFor example, S -> NT88 NT26: both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals because they have other productions.\n\nThen, NT63 -> NT48 NT87: non-terminals on both sides.\n\nBut"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string given is `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t36 t1 t16 t25 t23 t23 t23 t32 t45 t55 t44 t53 t27 t30 t8 t60`.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Additionally, in this case, the grammar seems to have production rules with non-terminals and terminals (like 't' strings). Looking at the grammar provided, some rules have a terminal and a non-terminal, which is allowed in CNF as long as every production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, no, in strict CNF, all productions are A \u2192 BC, with no terminals on the right side. So perhaps there's a mix here. Wait, looking back, the grammar includes rules like NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, which is okay, but also rules like NT7 \u2192 t2, which has a terminal. Hmm, that suggests some terminals are present, so the grammar might not be in strict CNF because in strict CNF, all rules are two non-terminals. Maybe the original problem allows for some terminals, but perhaps the given grammar is in a modified form with some rules allowing terminals, perhaps in a form where non-terminals can expand into terminals through intermediate steps.\n\nBut regardless, I need to figure out how to parse the string using this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, all lowercase t followed by numbers. The approach here is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S, following the production rules.\n\nLet me list the production rules for easier reference. The start symbol is S, which is defined as NT88 NT26. So the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 means that S can generate a string that starts with whatever NT88 produces and is followed by whatever NT26 produces. Since both NT88 and NT26 are non-terminals, each will have their own production rules.\n\nI think the best approach here is to perform a top-down parsing attempt, using the given string to see if it can be generated by expanding the start symbol step by step. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach starting from the string and trying to reduce it to the start symbol could also work. However, given the structure, top-down might be more straightforward.\n\nBut given that the grammar is provided in CNF, perhaps it's easier to construct a parse tree by considering each production's structure.\n\nLet me look at the production for S: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string should start with NT88 and then NT26. Let's split the given string into two parts: the first part from NT88 and the second part from NT26.\n\nThe string is: t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t36 t1 t16 t25 t23 t23 t23 t32 t45 t55 t44 t53 t27 t30 t8 t60.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire string is a concatenation of the expansions of NT88 and NT26. So the string must be the expansion of NT88 followed by the expansion of NT26.\n\nWait, but the given string is a sequence of terminals, so each NT88 and NT26 must produce sequences of terminals. Therefore, I can split the string into two parts: the first part generated by NT88 and the second by NT26. The question is, does the string split in such a way that each part can be generated by their respective non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT88 and NT26 can each generate multiple terminal sequences, and the total string is the concatenation of these. So I should try to find a split point in the string where the first part is generated by NT88 and the second by NT26.\n\nBut wait, the string is a single sequence of terminals; it doesn't have a delimiter. So perhaps the entire string must be generated by S, which is NT88 followed by NT26. So the total string must be equal to the concatenation of NT88's production and NT26's production.\n\nTherefore, the string should be split into two parts: NT88 produces the first part, and NT26 produces the second part. So the total number of symbols should match the concatenation of two NT88 and NT26's productions.\n\nLet me first see what NT88 and NT26 produce. I'll need to trace the productions for these.\n\nStarting with NT88: According to the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT8 \u2192 t29. So NT88 can be immediately reduced to t29.\n\nNext, NT26: Looking at the grammar, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13. Now, each of these can be expanded further.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28. NT54 \u2192 NT16 (since NT54's production isn't listed, maybe it's a terminal? Wait, in the grammar provided, NT54 is defined as NT16, but in the list, I don't see NT54 being a terminal. Wait, looking through the rules:\n\nLet me search the grammar for NT54. Wait, looking through the provided rules, I don't see any rule for NT54. Hmm, perhaps it's supposed to be a terminal. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe the rules are listed in a non-sequential manner, so perhaps NT54 is not present, which might mean that NT54 is a terminal, or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, no, looking through the list again, I don't see any entry for NT54. So maybe NT54 is a terminal, like 't54' perhaps. Or maybe I need to check if it's a non-terminal that has a production, but none is listed, so it might be a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 \u2192 NT56. NT56 is also not listed, so perhaps it's a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given rules, for example, NT56 \u2192 t25, which is a terminal. Hmm, so perhaps NT56 is a terminal. But wait, the production for NT56 is not present in the initial rules. So perhaps there's a confusion here.\n\nWait, wait, in the initial list of rules, the lines are not well-organized.

{"custom_id":"request-407","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar first. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and looking at the productions, S starts as NT88 NT26. So, the derivation will expand these and then the NTs will expand further until we get to terminals.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: `t37 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t17 t23 t1 t16 t56 t20 t1 t44 t36 t26 t47 t6 t55 t44 t53 t28 t60`.\n\nWait, let me count the tokens. That's 22 t's. Since the grammar in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. Starting from S, each expansion increases the count by one (since each non-terminal becomes two symbols). So, to get to n symbols, you need n-1 steps from S, which is a single symbol. \n\nWait, no, actually, each production either keeps the same or increases by one (if it's A \u2192 BC). Starting from S, which is one symbol, after each expansion, the number of symbols increases by one. So, for a string of length m, we need m-1 expansions.\n\nThe given string has 22 tokens, meaning 21 expansion steps. Hmm.\n\nBut given that, to parse a string, let's see the order of how the terminals can appear.\n\nMaybe it's easier to represent the string as a sequence and see if we can find a derivation path that reaches it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the string, ensuring each non-terminal in the string has productions that can generate its parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I can start from the start symbol S (which is NT88 NT26) and see how the string can be formed.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to work backwards, starting from the string and factoring it into chunks that can be generated by the grammar's productions.\n\nSo, let me list the string:\n\nt37 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t17 t23 t1 t16 t56 t20 t1 t44 t36 t26 t47 t6 t55 t44 t53 t28 t60\n\nAlternatively, this is:\n\nt37, t16, t56, t30, t55, t44, t17, t23, t1, t16, t56, t20, t1, t44, t36, t26, t47, t6, t55, t44, t53, t28, t60\n\nI notice that 't6' appears near the end in t60. Looking at the terminals, 't6' is derived from NT70, specifically NT70 \u2192 t6 (from the grammar, under NT70: NT70 \u2192 t12 t12, but I don't see 't6' in that. Wait, looking back, in the given grammar, for NT70, it's NT70 \u2192 t12 t12.

{"custom_id":"request-422","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided Unrestricted grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, and it's given that S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the leftmost symbols in any derivation must expand from S.\n\nThe string I'm evaluating is: `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t25 t20 t9 t39 t33 t44 t55 t44 t53 t11 t60`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since it's Chomsky Normal Form, the string should be a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, but in the end, all non-terminals must expand to terminals.\n\nI notice that the string starts with t29. Looking at the grammar rules, I see NT17 \u2192 t29 and NT48 \u2192 t27? Wait, no, NT17 has two options. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for t29:\n- NT48 \u2192 t27 is incorrect because it's 't27' but not 't29'.\n- NT17 \u2192 t29 is correct. So NT17 must produce t29. So the first part of the string is 't29', which comes from NT17.\n\nSo the first symbol is t29, which comes from expanding NT17. Then, the next part is t60. Let's see where t60 comes from.\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT55 \u2192 t8, NT44 \u2192 t44, etc. Wait, where is t60? I don't see any production with t60 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, the last part of the string ends with t60. Let me look again for NT that produce t60. Hmm, in the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 t54, NT28 \u2192 't25' etc. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NTs.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 't52' and NT42 \u2192 't18'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 has two options: one is NT52, and the other is 't52' under NT42. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me look for NT that lead to t60.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT79 \u2192 t22, NT22 \u2192 t44, NT44 \u2192 t44, etc. Hmm, perhaps t60 comes from NT55 \u2192 t52, but I'm not seeing a production for t60 directly as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack. The string is long, so maybe there's a better way to approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t29, which comes from NT17 \u2192 't29'. So the first step is to expand S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Then, one of these non-terminals needs to produce t29. Wait, S is Nts NT88 and NT26. So I think we need to derive a production where one of these produces a non-terminal that can lead to t29, and the other non-terminal leads to the rest of the string.\n\nWait, no, because S is NT88 and NT26 as a pair. So both need to be expanded into a terminal string. So the beginning parts have to come from NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me check NT88 and NT26. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So to get to the beginning 't29 t60', which is two terminals, S must have produced t29 from NT88 and then some NT that produces t60 from NT26.\n\nWait, wait, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So both NT88 and NT26 must be expanded into terminal strings. So the first two symbols of the string would come from NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo the string starts with NT88 \u2192 something, and NT26 \u2192 something. So let's look at NTS NT88 and NT26.\n\nStarting with NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So to get terminal t29 first, NT8 and NT32 would need to expand to t29 and t60, but NT8 doesn't produce t60. This seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's check NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So NT8 must derive t29, and NT32 must derive t60? But I don't see how NT8 can produce t29 because looking at NT8: from the rules, I don't see NT8 \u2192 anything with t29. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nWait, NT48 \u2192 t27 is there, but NT8 is in the rules: NT48 \u2192 t27 etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT48 has two rules: NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 and NT48 \u2192 't27'. So perhaps NT8 is another NT.\n\nWait, I might be confusing NTs. Let me list all NTs:\n\nNTs are from NT13 up to NT98, etc. Each NT has rules.\n\nFor example, NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70 and 't36'. Wait, so NT2 can produce 't36'. Similarly, many NTs have mixed rules, where sometimes they produce non-terminals and other times produce 't' symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps each NT can be in two modes: sometimes they produce a terminal, other times they produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT2 has two rules: NT2 \u2192 't36' and NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70.\n\nSo if we choose to use the terminal rule for NT2, it will produce 't36'.\n\nSo let's try to see:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26. So these two need to derive the first two symbols of the string.\n\nGiven the string starts with t29 t60.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nNT88 \u2192 t29 and NT26 \u2192 t60?\n\nBut looking at NT88: Its rules are NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So to generate 't29', NT88 must produce a terminal.

But for that, NT88 must have a rule that directly gives 't29', but looking at the grammar, I don't see that.\n\nLooking through all NTs, do any have a rule of the form x \u2192 t29 or x \u2192 t60?\n\nYes, for example, NT17 \u2192 t29 and NT25 \u2192 t25 (Wait, no, NT25 \u2192 't25'? Let me check: NT25 \u2192 't25' is a production. So if NT25 can produce 't25' directly.\n\nSo, to get t29 as the first symbol, we might need NT17 \u2192 t29.\n\nSimilarly, to get t60, perhaps NT25 \u2192 t25 is not the case. Let me check the rule for NT26.\n\nWait, wait, NT26's rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT26 directly producing t60. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the start, the initial expansion of S.\n\nIf I have to derive the string, each step must produce a terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nTo get the first two symbols as t29 and t60, perhaps S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and NT88 \u2192 t29, and NT26 \u2192 t60.\n\nSo, for NT88 to produce t29, it must have a production that allows it to produce t29 as a terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT88 only has rules that produce two NTs. So for that to happen, it must derive through non-terminals, not terminals. So t29 can only come from NT that can derive 't29' via their own terminals.\n\nSo perhaps NT88 needs to first expand into another NT that can produce 't29', but wait, I'm getting stuck.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t29.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing, but I'm not going to parse it; I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, looking at the string: t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t56 t39 t38 t1 t44 t55 t44 t11 t30 t8 t47 t60 t55 t44 t53 t28 t6.\n\nI notice that this is a sequence of terminals. So, starting from S, all derivations must reduce to these terminals in order.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched to a production rule step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the overall structure. The start symbol is S, which in CNF can only have one production. Let me check the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo, S splits into NT88 and NT26. Now, each of these needs to generate the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts: the first part should be generated by NT88, and the second part by NT26. Let me see how many tokens are in each part. The string is:\n\nLeft part (after S \u2192 NT88 NT26): t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t56 t39 t38 t1\nRight part: t44 t55 t44 t11 t30 t8 t47 t60 t55 t44 t53 t28 t6\n\nSo, I need to check if NT88 can generate the left part and NT26 the right part.\n\nStarting with NT88: Let's look at the productions for NT88.\n\nLooking through the grammar: Oh, I see NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT32 \u2192 t33 (from NT32->t1). Wait, but in the string, the left part starts with t54, but NT88 is supposed to generate after splitting into NT8 and NT32, which would then have to produce t54 t60 and then t33. So perhaps NT8 generates t54 t60 and NT32 generates t53? Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, wait. Let me find the productions for NT8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's find the productions for NT8. I don't see NT8 in the list, so maybe it's a terminal? Let's check the terminals provided in the grammar. Wait, the grammar is given as NTs and terminals like t54, t60, etc. Some NTs are defined as terminals. For example, some NTs have productions ending with a single terminal letter, such as NT69 \u2192 't27' or NT17 \u2192 't29'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, it seems that many of the NTs directly produce a single terminal, except several that produce pairs of NTs.\n\nSo, the idea is that each NT can either produce another NT and a terminal, or a terminal on its own.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, many rules have a non-terminal followed by a terminal, like NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 or NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps each rule represents a step where the left NT leads to a sequence of NTs and then a terminal. This seems like a recursive structure.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, verify if the entire string can be parsed by the grammar. Let's use the recursive descent approach since it's in CNF.\n\nSo, the string is a list of terminals. We can try to parse it using the rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, the first symbol must be the left part generated by NT88, followed by the right part generated by NT26.\n\nSo, the string is:\n\nLeft: [t54, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t30, t56, t39, t38, t1]\nRight: [t44, t55, t44, t11, t30, t8, t47, t60, t55, t44, t53, t28, t6]\n\nI need to see if Left can be derived from NT88 and Right from NT26.\n\nFirst, parsing Left:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nSo, after NT8, the next symbols are generated by NT32.\n\nLooking at the string: first symbol is t54. So, does NT32 \u2192 t54? Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT32 directly producing t54. Wait, no. Let me check: NT32 \u2192 t33 is one of the productions. Oh, but the string starts with t54, which doesn't align. Hmm, maybe I have an error here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misassigned the left and right parts.\n\nWait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the entire string must be the left (from NT88) followed by the right (from NT26). So, the left is [t54, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t30, t56, t39, t38, t1], and the right is [t44, t55, t44, t11, t30, t8, t47, t60, t55, t44, t53, t28, t6].\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the division wrong. Maybe each split corresponds to the productions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me check:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nSo, NT8 needs to produce some sequence, and then NT32.\n\nIn the string's left part, the first symbol is t54. So, perhaps NT8 produces t54 via a direct production, but looking at the grammar, does NT8 have any direct production?\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT8 whose production ends with a terminal. For example, NT8 doesn't produce t54. All the productions for NT8 look like NT8 \u2192 ... pairs of NTs, except one production for NT8 is missing, so NT8 might be a terminal.\n\nWait, if NT8 were a terminal, then the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 would mean that S \u2192 (t54 t33) (something). Wait, no, because NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, so NT88 becomes t54 (assuming NT8 is terminal) followed by NT32.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I think I might have made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-449","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite large, which is a bit intimidating, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either breaks down a non-terminal into two non-terminals or a terminal. This structure should make it easier to parse the string, as each step in deriving the string should correspond to expanding a non-terminal into two parts.\n\nNext, I'll examine the string to be evaluated: `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t25 t23 t23 t23 t33 t45 t55 t44 t53 t27 t26 t6`. It looks like a sequence of terminals, so I need to check if this sequence can be formed by expanding the start symbol S down to these terminals through the allowed productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar starts with S, I'll focus on the productions under S. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, S expands directly into two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Therefore, the first two symbols of the string must correspond to the terminals generated by NT88 and NT26, respectively.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with `t6 t60 t52 ...`. So, the first part is `t6` and then `t60`. Hmm, that suggests that NT88 must generate `t6` and NT26 must generate `t60`. Let me check the productions for NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and then NT8 \u2192 't29', NT32 \u2192 't56', so NT88 \u2192 't29 t56'. That would give `t29` followed by `t56`, not `t6` and `t60`. That doesn't match. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Perhaps S is NTSomething else, or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, looking again, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the first two parts of the string should be the expansions of NT88 and NT26. Let's check NT26 first because the second symbol is `t60`.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, and then NT68 \u2192 't54', and NT13 \u2192 't12'. So NT26 \u2192 't54 t12', which would give `t54` and then something else, but the second symbol is `t60`. That doesn't match either. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the order is different, or maybe I'm looking at the wrong productions. Alternatively, maybe the NT26 expansion leads to more non-terminals further down the line. Let me map out the entire expansion step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach should be to work backwards from the string, trying to find possible productions that can generate it. But given the size of the grammar, that could be time-consuming. Maybe it's better to see if the string can be split into parts that match the start symbol's production.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the string can be divided into pairs of terminals that match the non-terminals produced by each step. For example, starting from S, each step would split the non-terminals into two, and so on until all are terminals. So, the string length should be a power of 2? Let's check the length.\n\nThe string has 27 symbols. Hmm, 27 is not a power of two (2^4=16, 2^5=32). So, perhaps the string has some parts that can be grouped differently. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, but I don't see any immediate issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is not properly formed because it ends with `t6`, but according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which would require that the string starts with NT88 and then NT26. But since the string ends with `t6`, which is the terminal generated by some NT, perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, maybe if I construct the parse tree step by step. Let's try:\n\nThe string is 27 symbols, so it's an odd number. That suggests that perhaps the initial split from S is possible, but considering how each production splits into two, maybe the number of symbols should be a power of two. But 27 is not a power of two, so perhaps it's impossible, hence the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Maybe the grammar allows for different grouping. Alternatively, perhaps the string is such that the first few symbols don't align with any of the NT productions.\n\nAnother approach: each production either splits into two non-terminals or into a terminal. So when you expand S, it's split into two non-terminals, which then each split into two more, and so on. So the total number of terminal symbols would be 2^k for some k. But 27 is 2^4 + 15, which is not a power of two. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by a grammar in CNF because it's not a power of two in length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the string: t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t25 t23 t23 t23 t33 t45 t55 t44 t53 t27 t26 t6. That's 27 symbols. So, not a power of two.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the given grammar because it's not of the form where the number of terminals is 2^k for some k.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should try to parse the string as much as possible. Let's start:\n\nThe string is t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t25 t23 t23 t23 t33 t45 t55 t44 t53 t27 t26 t6.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first symbols should be generated by NT88 and NT26. So, NT88 should generate t6 or some sequence, but according to the productions, NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT8 \u2192 t29, NT32 \u2192 t56. So NT88 \u2192 t29 t56, which would be `t29 t56`. But the string starts with `t6`, which doesn't match, so this suggests that NT88 does not generate t6. Therefore, S cannot generate the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong about S's production. Let me check again: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first two symbols must be NT88 and NT26's expansions. But the string's first symbols are `t6 t60`. So, unless NT88 is 't6' and NT26 is 't60', but looking at the productions, does any NT produce 't6'?\n\nLooking through the grammar... Hmm, let me scan for NT that produce 't6'. Scanning through the productions:\n\nFor NT26: \u2192 NT68 NT13, etc. Doesn't produce 't6' directly. Same for others. Let me look for any NT that directly produce 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT13 \u2192 't4' and others, but I'm not seeing 't6' as a terminal. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through all NT productions, I spot NT53 \u2192 't53' but nothing for 't6'. So perhaps 't6' is not generated directly by any NT. Wait, no, in the grammar, one of the rules is NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, but then NT68 \u2192 't54', NT81 \u2192 't17'... Hmm, maybe it's a problem that NT88 doesn't produce 't6', making it impossible for the string to start with 't6'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar has an error, but regardless, given the string starts with 't6', and the only NT that produces a 't' is in the productions, but none produce 't6', this would make it impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nSo, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, and each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t17 t1 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t53 t1 t20 t44 t60`.\n\nFirst, let's parse the grammar to see what terminals are present. The non-terminals are all the S and NT followed by numbers: NT88, NT63, etc. The terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers, some of which are single letters like 't4', 't6', and so on.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the production is S -> NT88 NT26. So the initial sentence starts with NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either splits into two non-terminals or matches a terminal. To check if the string is in the language, we need to see if we can derive the string from S using these productions.\n\nLet's break down the string into its components:\n\nt29, t60, t52, t18, t16, t25, t30, t55, t44, t23, t17, t1, t16, t56, t20, t9, t20, t44, t55, t44, t53, t1, t20, t44, t60.\n\nThis is 23 tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal symbol except for non-terminals. So, I need to see if each token can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand directly into terminals. For example, NT7 -> NT11 NT22, and then NT11 -> 't4', NT22 -> 't2' Wait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like NT7 -> NT11 NT22. So NT7 is split into NT11 and NT22. Then, NT11 is 't4' and NT22 is 't2'. But in the string, I see a 't2' which could correspond to NT22. But in the provided string, there's a t20, which is actually 't20' as a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, the terminals are all 't' followed by numbers. So each 't' plus a number is a separate terminal. So, I'll list each token as they are:\n\nToken list (for clarity):\n1. t29\n2. t60\n3. t52\n4. t18\n5. t16\n6. t25\n7. t30\n8. t55\n9. t44\n10. t23\n11. t17\n12. t1\n13. t16\n14. t56\n15. t20\n16. t9\n17. t20\n18. t44\n19. t55\n20. t44\n21. t53\n22. t1\n23. t20\n24. t44\n25. t60\n\nWait, wait, the given string is 25 tokens. Let me recount:\n\nThe string provided is: `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t17 t1 t16 t56 t20 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t53 t1 t20 t44 t60`.\n\nSo that's 25 words, each a terminal like 't29', 't60', etc.\n\nEach of these must be matched by a production in the grammar. So, I'll go through each token and see if there's a non-terminal in the grammar that can produce it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs directly produce a single 't' with a number. For example:\n\nNT90 -> NT91 NT68, which splits into more NTs.\n\nBut some terminals are directly produced, such as:\n\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22: but NT11 is 't4' and NT22 is 't2' (wait, no: looking at the grammar, NT22 is 't44' or something else? Wait, let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22\nAnd inside the grammar, I see:\nNT11 -> 't4'\nNT22 -> 't2' Is that right?\n\nWait no, looking at the grammar lines:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT11 -> 't4'\nNT22 -> 't2' Wait, is that correct? Or is it 't2' somewhere else?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT22:\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a line: NT22 -> 't44'? Or no, looking through each line, I need to find where the terminals are defined.\n\nWait, the grammar is huge, but I can scan for terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22\nNT11 -> 't4'\nNT22 -> 't2' Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT75 -> 't60'\nNT77 -> 't33'\nNT90 -> 't56'\nNT91 -> 't2 NT33'\nNT94 -> 't57'\nNT14 -> 't66'\nNT50-> 't38'\nNT2-> 't36'\nNT91-> 't44'\nNT18-> 't26'\nNT12-> 't23'\nNT72-> 't23'\nNT94-> 't23'\nNT54-> 't16'\nNT13-> 't12'\nNT59-> 't15'\nNT72-> 't38'\nNT58-> 't28'\nNT98-> 't45'\nNT88-> 't37'\nNT86-> 't9'\nNT83-> 't52'\nNT33-> 't1'\nNT28-> 't25'\nNT48-> 't27'\nNT7-> 't2'\nNT70-> 't11'\nNT53-> 't48'\nNT72-> 't33'\nNT76-> 't55'\nNT22-> 't44'\nNT41-> 't49'\nNT2-> 't34'\nNT40-> 't60'\nNT20-> 't20'\n\nSo, the terminals are the ones that are written as 'tX', where X is a number. Each of these is a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, for example, NT2 -> 't36' means that NT2 can be replaced by the terminal 't36'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7-> nt11 nt22, which then can lead to t4 and t2, but wait, NT22 is another non-terminal. Wait, looking at the production for NT22, in the grammar I see NT22-> 't44', so NT22 is a non-terminal that can expand to 't44'.\n\nSo, for the string token 't2', that would correspond to the non-terminal NT2, which expands to 't36' according to the grammar. Wait no, looking back, the grammar for NT2 is:\n\nLooking through the grammar again, I see:\n\nYes, the production for NT2 is: NT2 -> 't36'\n\nSo, if a string has 't2', that would be problematic because NT2 only expands to 't36', so there's no way to have 't2' from NT2. Wait, but in the grammar, is any NT producing 't2'?\n\nLooking through, there's NT22 -> 't44'\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT40 -> 't60'\n\nWait, but none of the NTs directly produce 't2' except for NT7, which expands to NT11 and NT22. Which are 't4' and 't44' respectively.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, I have a token 't29', 't60', up to 't44', 't60' at the end.\n\nWait, the string has 't1', 't16', 't56', 't9', etc. Let's see where these come from.\n\nNow, let's list each token and see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that a CFG in CNF has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side produces exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the base cases which produce a single terminal or perhaps another non-terminal. Looking back at the grammar, all the productions indeed have two non-terminals on the right, except for those ending with a terminal string like \"tN\" or single terminals. Wait, actually, some rules produce a terminal like 't27' or other strings, but in CNF, typically, the right-hand side should consist of two non-terminals. However, in this case, some productions seem to directly produce terminals, which might be part of the language.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t34 t1 t16 t56 t39 t38 t1 t44 t15 t49 t6 t26 t6 t55 t44 t38 t1 t20 t44 t60`.\n\nThe grammar provided includes rules like \"S -> NT88 NT26\", and each non-terminal (NT) can produce other non-terminals or a terminal followed by another non-terminal. For example, NT48 -> 't2' followed by 't32', or something like that. Wait, I see something like \"NT7 -> NT59 NT58\", or \"NT98 -> NT41 NT40\", but also, some non-terminals like NT88 directly go to 't8' and another non-terminal (like NT32).\n\nTo parse the string, I think a recursive descent parser would be appropriate since the grammar is in CNF, which allows for efficient parsing, especially with a top-down approach. But since I'm doing this manually, I need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the string. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. The string is a sequence of these terminals, and I need to see if they can be generated by expanding the start symbol S into these terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT88 and NT26. Let's look at NT88. Checking the grammar, NT88 -> 't8' and NT32. Then NT32 goes to NT73 and NT42. Hmm. So NT88 is 't8' followed by the NT32 rule.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't54 t27 ...'. So maybe this corresponds to a different branch. Wait, perhaps I should map the string back through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by filling a table where each cell represents whether a substring can be derived from a non-terminal. Since I'm not familiar with all the details, I'll try to see if the string can be divided into segments that match the grammar rules.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't54 t27'. Let's check which rules produce 't54'. Looking through the rules, I see NT54 -> 't16', NT55 -> 't52', and others. Hmm, not immediately obvious. Alternatively, maybe 't54' comes from a rule that's connected via other steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each step must generate pairs of non-terminals leading to terminals. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each must be generated by a rule that eventually terminates.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string as a series of steps where each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until only terminals remain.\n\nStarting with S: it must expand to NT88 and NT26. Let's see how each of these can produce the string.\n\nNT88 -> 't8' and NT32. So 't8' is a terminal, and NT32 must produce the rest after 't8'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t34 t1 t16 t56 t39 t38 t1 t44 t15 t49 t6 t26 t6 t55 t44 t38 t1 t20 t44 t60'. Wait, maybe I need to see if 't8' is followed by the part corresponding to NT32.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't54 t27', which doesn't include 't8'. So perhaps that's a different branch. Maybe NT26 is producing something else.\n\nLooking at NT26: NT26 -> NT68 and NT13. NT68 -> 't68' and NT56. Wait, no, looking back: NT68 is in the grammar as... Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, NT68 -> NT56 and NT28, because looking through the rules:\n\nWait, let's scan the grammar:\n\nNT68 -> NT56 NT28\n\nYes, so NT68 is 't56' followed by NT28. Then NT28 -> NT58 and NT18, according to the rules, no: wait, no, from the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT28: \"NT28 -> NT56 NT18\" (the line is NT28 -> NT58 -> ... Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nActually, the grammar rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT28: NT56 NT18? No.\n\nWait, looking through the provided list:\n\n\"NT58 -> NT33 NT48\"\n\n\"NT28 -> 't56' NT18\"? Wait, no, from the list:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see a NT28 production. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nLooking for 'NT28':\n\nI see \"NT58 -> NT33 NT4\", \"NT17 -> 't47'\", \"NT18 -> 't47'\", \"NT28 -> 't56'\", etc. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nAh, yes, I see: \"NT28 -> 't56' NT18\". So NT28 is 't56' followed by NT18.\n\nThen NT18: which rule is for NT18? Looking at the grammar: \"NT18 -> NT66 NT55\" and \"NT18 -> 't47'\". So NT18 can either produce NT66 and NT55 or 't47'.\n\nIn the string, the part after the first 't54 t27' continues with 't18 t16...', which might correspond to NT18 producing 't47' or another path.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try a different approach. Since every production in CNF is a binary split, the entire string can be viewed as a series of splits where each split reduces the number of non-terminals by one until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the rules in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S -> NT88 NT26. NT88 -> 't8' NT32. Then NT32 -> NT73 NT42. NT73 -> 't73'? Wait, in the grammar, NT73 -> 't75'... Wait, looking back: the grammar has NT73 -> 't75'...? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT73: \"NT73 -> 't75' NT83\" (line is NT73 -> 't75' NT83). Similarly, NT7 -> ... etc.\n\nWait, I think I need a better way to structure this.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be divided into segments where each segment is the right-hand side of a production rule.\n\nGiven that the entire string is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, each step in the derivation would produce pairs that expand further until only terminals remain.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production of a non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals (or a terminal and a non-terminal in some cases, but in CNF, it's supposed to be two non-terminals). Wait, but in the grammar provided, some rules have a terminal followed by a non-terminal, which might not fit CNF.\n\nWait, is the grammar in strict CNF, which requires each production to be A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or can it include A -> aB or a production where a is a terminal and B is a non-terminal?\n\nWait, wait, no: CNF is specifically when each production is A -> BC, with A, B, C being non-terminals.

CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't have any trailing terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, the start symbol is S, and the productions all follow the CNF structure. Each non-terminal on the left is replaced by two non-terminals on the right, except when it directly expands to a terminal.\n\nThe string in question starts with `t37`, which I notice is a terminal. So, I should look for a production that directly gives `t37`. Looking through the grammar, I see `NT86 -> t9` and `NT83 -> t52`. But wait, there's also a production for NT88: `S -> NT88 NT26` and `NT88 -> NT8 NT32`. Then, NT8 -> 't29' and NT32 -> NT56. So, NT88 \u2192 t29 t56. But wait, I need to see if any right-hand side of a production starts with t37. Looking through the productions, I see NT94 -> 't57', but I don't see any production that directly starts with t37. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, I might have missed something. Looking at the productions, I see NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and NT8 is 't29', and NT32 \u2192 NT56, which is 't56'. So, NT88 \u2192 t29 t56. But in the string, the first part is t37, which isn't directly produced by any rule.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for which non-terminal can produce t37 directly. But checking the grammar, I don't see any production where A \u2192 t37. The closest is maybe NT54 \u2192 t16, but t16 is different. NT86 is t9. So, the first token t37 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal. That's a problem because in a CFG in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the first token must be a terminal that is directly produced by some production.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let's think again. The string starts with t37, so there must be a production that either is A \u2192 t37 or a chain leading to t37. Wait, maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce t37 through a series of productions. But looking through all the productions, I don't see any rule that produces t37 as a terminal. All the terminals are things like t1, t2, t3, etc., but not t37. So, perhaps the answer is No because the first token t37 isn't generated by any production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the grammar. I'll scan all the productions for terminals:\n\nNT4 -> t20\nNT7 -> t2 (and also t58)\nNT17 -> t47\nNT22 -> t44\nNT25 -> t20\nNT26 -> t23\nNT28 -> t33\nNT30 -> t21\nNT33 -> t1\nNT35 -> t44\nNT37 is t29 (no, wait, NT8 -> t29)\nWait, no. Looking again:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32 \u2192 t29 t56\nSo, t29 is from NT8, which is one of the productions. But t37 is not directly produced by any rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in not noticing. Let me list all the terminals:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' and 't58'\n- NT8 -> 't29'\n- NT17 -> 't47'\n- NT22 -> 't44'\n- NT25 -> 't20'\n- NT26 -> 't23'\n- NT28 -> 't33'\n- NT32 -> 't56'\n- NT4 -> 't20'\n- NT6 ... etc. So, t37 isn't mentioned as a terminal in any production.\n\nThat means the first token t37 cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar because there's no production that directly outputs t37. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a chain of productions that eventually leads to t37. For example, could some non-terminal derive to t37 through multiple steps? Let's see. But in the provided grammar, I don't see any production rule that outputs t37, so it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it starts with a terminal that's not directly produced by any rule.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-483","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t25 t20 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t33 t45 t26 t60 t55 t44 t53 t28 t6`, and the grammar has a lot of production rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal symbol or two non-terminals, and the start symbol is S. Since all the rules here are in CNF except maybe some that were written with -> separating two non-terminals, I think it's safe to proceed.\n\nThe string consists of a series of t's followed by numbers. I also notice that the grammar replaces non-terminals with these t-variants. For example, S starts as NT88 NT26, which may derive into a t-string.\n\nI need to see if the string can be constructed by successively replacing the non-terminals until all that's left are the terminals. So I should probably start from the top-level symbol, which seems to be S, and see if the string can be broken down into the productions starting from S.\n\nLooking at the first step, S -> NT88 NT26. So the string should start with the expansion of NT88 and NT26. Let's look at NT88 and NT26 in the grammar.\n\nNT88 -> NT83 NT32, and NT32 -> NT73 NT42. NT73 -> NT75 NT83, and NT75 -> NT54 NT28. NT83 in turn has rules like NT83 -> NT8 NT32, which seems to loop back.\n\nWait, maybe that's getting complicated. Let me start by breaking down the string into chunks that match the possible terminal symbols. The string is:\n\nt6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44 t16 t25 t20 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t33 t45 t26 t60 t55 t44 t53 t28 t6.\n\nI notice the string starts with t6, which I'll look for in the terminals. Let's see where each t comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a few t rules. For example, NT12 -> t17, NT59 -> t15, NT18 -> t47, etc. But for 't6' to come from which non-terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT70: NT70 -> NT12 NT12, and then NT12 is either t17 or t23. Wait, no, looking at the rules, there are several NT entries that lead to 't6'. For example:\n\n- NT72 -> t22 (Wait, let me check the rules)\n\nWait, let me look for any rule where a non-terminal is replaced by 't6'. Looking through, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> t36\n- NT69 -> t27\n- NT32 -> t73 NT42, but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, checking all the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\nNT11 -> 't4'\nNT66 -> 't30'\nNT8 -> 't6'\nNT54 -> 't16'\nNT13 -> 't12'\nNT72 -> 't22'\nNT12 -> 't17'\nNT8 -> 't6'\nNT97 -> 't4'\nNT94 -> 't57'\nNT51 -> 't39'\nNT2 -> 't36'\n\nWait, I'm not seeing 't6' as a terminal directly from any of these except NT8's two rules: NT8 -> 't6' from NT8? Wait, no, looking back, the rules are in the form NTxx -> expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me parse each rule correctly. For example, the rule NT8 -> 't29' is incorrect because looking back, I saw NT8 is part of a rule that produces 't29'. Wait, actually, in the grammar, for example, NT88 -> NT83 NT32, and then some other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for 't6' in the grammar. Let me scan through the list again.\n\nI see NT88 -> NT83 NT32, which in turn may produce 't60' and 't60' in the string. Wait, looking:\n\nIn the string, after the first 't6' comes 't60'. So maybe a non-terminal that produces 't6' and 't60'?\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT90 -> NT91 NT68. NT91 -> 't44' and NT68 -> 't56'. But that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the string comes from expanding S step by step, replacing non-terminals with their respective productions.\n\nGiven that S -> NT88 NT26, so the string should start with the expansion of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me look at NT88: NT88 -> NT83 NT32.\n\nSo NT88 becomes NT83 and NT32. Let's see NT83 and NT32.\n\nNT83 -> NT8 NT32, which would again split into NT8 and NT32.\n\nBut wait, another option is that NT83 -> NT41 NT58, which might be useful.\n\nWait, NT83's productions are:\n\n- NT83 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT83 -> NT41 NT58\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to look for a way the string can be generated.\n\nLooking at the start, the first part is t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t44.\n\nLet me see if there's a way the first few symbols could come from a production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use a parsing approach, trying to match the string step by step, but since this could be time-consuming, perhaps I can spot patterns.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't6'. Where do 't's come from?\n\nI see that NT12 -> t17, but 't6' isn't listed directly. Wait, looking again, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, in the list:\n\n- NT2 -> t36\n- NT72 -> t22\n- NT12 -> t17, t23? Wait, no, looking through:\n\nWait, actually, from the grammar, looking for 't6' as a terminal, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't6', except perhaps in the rules for other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the grammar in a more readable way. Each line is NTxx -> something, where NTxx is a non-terminal, and the something is a sequence of rules.\n\nWait, no, actually, each line is a production where NTxx \u2192 something, and the something can be another non-terminal or the terminal 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, for example, NT75 -> t33 and t33? Wait, no, the grammar is written as separate lines, like:\n\nNT75 -> t60, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me list all the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that each line is a single production.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse each line correctly. Each line is a non-terminal followed by ->, then a list of possible productions. So for example, the line:\n\nNT88 -> NT83 NT32\n\nmeans NT88 can produce either NT83 NT32. But there's another rule, perhaps?\n\nLooking through the grammar, each line represents a single production, so NT88 has only one rule: NT88-> NT83 NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT63 -> NT48 NT87.\n\nWait, now I see that the user listed a long list of rules, each on a separate line, so for each NT, there's a rule that says what it produces.\n\nSo, for example, S has at least one rule: S-> NT88 NT26.\n\nThen, NT88 has a rule: NT88-> NT83 NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT26-> NT68 NT13, etc.\n\nNow, looking for terminals, I see 't6', 't60', 't52', etc. So I need to find which NT rules produce these t-strings.\n\nFor instance, looking for 't6', perhaps NT88 includes 't6' as a terminal.

The grammar provided seems to fit that structure since all the rules on the left side of the arrow (e.g., S->NT88 NT26) are two non-terminals, and on the right, they either produce another non-terminal or a terminal (where the rule ends with 't' followed by a number indicating a terminal symbol).\n\nNow, the main goal is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S. So, I think the approach here is to parse the string from left to right using the given grammar's rules, trying to match each terminal symbol and see if we can consume the entire string.\n\nThe string has 32 symbols (since it's a list separated by spaces; let me count: the list given has 32 't' symbols, so the string is 32 symbols long). The initial symbol is S, and we need to derive this string.\n\nI'd probably start by splitting the string into individual terminal symbols: \"t6\", \"t27\", \"t18\", etc. Each of these needs to be matched by the productions.\n\nSince the grammar is CNF, each production either combines two non-terminals or produces a terminal. So, when parsing, at each step, we pick a production rule, break down the current string, and replace it with the left-hand side of the rule. Alternatively, in standard parsing methods, we might check for possible productions that can match the current context.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parsing strategy (greedy leftmost, rightmost, or something else), maybe I can approach this by breaking down the string into possible components.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t6. In the grammar, I see that NT70 -> t11, but I also look for rules where a non-terminal directly produces t6. Scanning the list, I see:\n\nLooking for rules where X \u2192 t6. Checking the grammar rules, for example:\n\n- NT86 \u2192 t9\n- NT83 \u2192 t52\n- NT58 \u2192 t11\n- NT11 \u2192 t21\n- NT69 \u2192 t27\n- NT70 \u2192 t11\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT91 \u2192 t2 t33\n- NT98 \u2192 t45\n- NT87 \u2192 t76 t35\n- NT55 \u2192 t54\n- NT13 \u2192 t12 t4\n\nWait, I might have to look more carefully. Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with 't6'. Scanning through all the rules:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 t32 (t32 is 32, not 6)\n- NT40 \u2192 t60\n- NT20 \u2192 t51\n- NT18 \u2192 t47\n- NT58 \u2192 t69\n- NT12 \u2192 t23\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT70 \u2192 t11\n- NT17 \u2192 t19\n- NT90 \u2192 t91\n- NT88 \u2192 t37\n- NT94 \u2192 t57\n- NT73 \u2192 t75 t83\n- NT55 \u2192 t54\n- NT48 \u2192 t2 t18\n- NT75 \u2192 t60\n- NT50 \u2192 t38\n- NT90 \u2192 t91\n- NT13 \u2192 t12 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT91 \u2192 t44\n- NT18 \u2192 t16\n- NT12 \u2192 t23\n- NT72 \u2192 t38\n- NT94 \u2192 t23\n- NT54 \u2192 t16\n- NT13 \u2192 t12 t92\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see if any non-terminal directly produces t6.\n\nLooking through all the rules, the only one where a non-terminal produces a terminal symbol is in the form of, for example:\n\nNT7 -> t2\nNT70 -> t11\nNT58 -> t11\nNT13 -> t12 t4 (so it's a two-symbol production, but t12 is another non-terminal, and t4 is also a non-terminal)\nNT17 -> t29\nNT75 -> t60\nNT54 -> t16\nNT13's rule is a bit complex.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for symbols that produce t6 directly. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule where X \u2192 t6. Checking each production:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 t8 t32 \u2192 t8 and t32\n- NT58 \u2192 t11 \u2192 t11\n- NT77 \u2192 t33 t79\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t20 t22\n- NT73 \u2192 t75 t83\n- NT51 \u2192 t39\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\nWait, not seeing t6 as a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the non-terminals produce t6 directly. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t11\n- NT11 \u2192 t21\n- NT69 \u2192 t27\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT4 \u2192 t20 t22\n- NT17 \u2192 t19\n- NT58 \u2192 t11\n- NT12 \u2192 t23\n- NT91 \u2192 t44\n- NT13 \u2192 t12 t4\n- NT59 \u2192 t14 t20\n- Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me list all rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT77 \u2192 t33 t79\n- NT85 \u2192 t17 t58 \u2192 t17 and t58\nWait, no, t17 is another non-terminal. Let's think again.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with t6. Maybe none of them. Then perhaps the string starts with 't6', but the grammar doesn't have any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't6'. So that's a problem because the first symbol is t6, and if no rule produces t6, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true because perhaps a non-terminal can be expanded into another non-terminal which then produces t6. So maybe I can see if any symbols in the string expand into each other until they produce t6.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- The first symbol is t6, so we need some production rule that starts with S and somehow reduces down to t6. Or perhaps the top-level productions can generate sequences that include t6.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, and the production for S is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S expands into NT88 and NT26, each of which are non-terminals. So the first step is to expand S into NT88 and NT26, then process those.\n\nBut perhaps the string starts with t6, so we need to find if there's a way for NT88 or NT26 to produce something that can eventually lead to t6. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find whether t6 is present in the string, and see if the grammar has a path that allows a non-terminal to eventually produce t6. But looking through the rules, none of them produce t6 as a terminal. So that suggests that the first symbol t6 cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar, so the string cannot be generated. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because maybe I missed a rule somewhere. Let me go through each rule again to confirm if any produce t6.\n\nLooking through each production again:\n\n- S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n- NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n- NT41 \u2192 NT77 NT18\n- NT85 \u2192 NT17 NT58\n- NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n- NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n- NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94\n- NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n- NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t17 t1 t16 t25 t39 t38 t1 t44 t36 t26 t30 t54 t60 t55 t44 t38 t28 t6`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The grammar provided fits this structure, so that's good.\n\nThe idea is to look for a derivation path that starts from the start symbol S and ends with the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. The number of steps in the derivation should match the number of symbols in the string minus one because each step adds one symbol to the sentential form.\n\nThe given string has 30 symbols, including spaces. But wait, the actual string has spaces, so it's a bit tricky because each 't' followed by a number is a separate token. So the string is actually a sequence of 30 tokens, each being a 't' number. So to check the derivation, each production step adds one symbol, so the derivation length should be 29 steps (since starting from S, each step adds one symbol until we get to the string of 30 symbols).\n\nNow, looking for the first symbols after S. The start symbol S has a production rule: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the first two symbols should be NT88 and NT26. Let's check the string: the first two tokens are t29 and t60. That doesn't match NT88 (which would be t88) and NT26 (t26). Hmm, that's odd. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how non-terminals are translated into terminals.\n\nWait, I think the non-terminals are represented by 'NT' followed by a number, and terminals are 't' followed by a number. So the productions in the grammar replace NTxy with two non-terminals, which further break down until they reach terminal symbols.\n\nBut when building the parse tree from the string, I should look for rules that match the string sequence.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is CNF, we can use the CYK algorithm or another parsing method, but that might be more involved. Alternatively, I can attempt to manually reconstruct the parsing steps.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is t29. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production that starts with t29. Looking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t63 (t63 is already a terminal)\n- NT73 \u2192 t55\n- NT28 \u2192 t6\n- NT94 \u2192 t26\n- NT51 \u2192 t39\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT40 \u2192 t60\n- NT98 \u2192 t45\n- NT33 \u2192 t1\n- NT35 \u2192 t44\n- NT18 \u2192 t47\n- NT11 \u2192 t21\n- NT69 \u2192 t27\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT90 \u2192 t56\n- NT75 \u2192 t60\n- NT55 \u2192 t52\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t19\n- NT8 \u2192 t29\n- NT97 \u2192 t4\n- NT94 \u2192 t57\n- NT51 \u2192 t39\n- NT2 \u2192 t34\n- NT40 \u2192 t60\n- NT20 \u2192 t20\n\nWait, I'm looking for a terminal t29. Looking through the productions, NT8 \u2192 t29. So maybe the root production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 can derive into t29 somewhere.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT88 NT26, meaning the first step in the derivation is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which then needs to be expanded further. But the first token in the string is t29, which is a terminal. So in the parsing, either:\n\n1. The grammar allows empty productions (but it's in CNF, so no zero-length rules; all rules have two non-terminals or a terminal for one-step rules).\n2. Alternatively, maybe the string is malformed because the start symbol can't generate t29 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, looking again at the start symbol's productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nSo the first thing derived from S is two non-terminals, NT88 and NT26. These will then be expanded further. So the first symbols in the resulting string must be the terminals derived from NT88 and NT26 in some order.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t29, which would imply that the first part (NT88) is expanding to t29. But looking at the productions for NT88, I see a production:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nSo NT88 can't directly produce a terminal, only further non-terminals. So how does that string start with t29? It must be that one of the non-terminals in NT88 or NT26 eventually produces t29.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13, and looking at the productions for NT68 and NT13, which have their own expansions.\n\nThis might mean that we need to trace all possible expansions from S and see if the string can be produced, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t29, which is produced by NT8 \u2192 t29.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT88 NT26 could be involved in such a way that one of the NT88 or NT26 parts eventually produces NT8, which then becomes t29.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose that S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and then one of them, say NT88, expands to produce a terminal. But looking at NT88's production: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. So NT88 can't produce a terminal directly. It has to go through NT8 and NT32.\n\nBut NT8 can produce t29 directly. So maybe the derivation is something like:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 ... \u2192 NT8 ... \u2192 t29 ...\n\nSo let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t29. So perhaps the NT88 part is expanding into some sequence that includes t29. Let's see the steps:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNow, NT8 can be immediately derived to t29, as NT8 \u2192 t29.\n\nBut what about NT32? Looking at the productions for NT32, which is:\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42\n\nThen, NT73 \u2192 t75\n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT73 \u2192 t75? Wait, let me check the grammar. Looking back, under NT73, I see:\n\nNT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83\n\nWait, no, that's not right. In the grammar, NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83.\n\nBut then NT75 is a production: NT75 \u2192 t60\n\nAnd NT83 is a production: NT83 \u2192 NT40 NT18\n\nBut NT40 \u2192 t60, and NT18 \u2192 t47.\n\nWait, this seems confusing.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol S, which can produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \"t37 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t56 t17 t23 t23 t23 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t53 t1 t17 t23 t57 t33 t44 t60\".\n\nFirst, I should note that all the elements in the string are terminal symbols, which are either 't' followed by a number or specific predefined strings like 'ntX'. But looking at the grammar, most of the non-terminals on the right-hand side of the productions can only produce certain sequences of other non-terminals or specific terminals.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the top of the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, S produces two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. Each of these can produce other non-terminals, and so on until we get to the terminal symbols.\n\nLet's look at the productions for NT88 and NT26.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo, the string must derive from NT88 NT26, which means the string should have something that produces NT88, then something that produces NT26, and the concatenation of these two sequences should be the given string.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the string: \"t37 t16 t25 t30...\"\n\nI need to see if any of the non-terminals can produce 't37' or 't16' first.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT88: it's NT8 followed by NT32.\n\nSo, NT8 must produce 't37 t16 t25 t30...' or some part of it.\n\nLooking for NT8 in the grammar:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT59 NT58\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20\n- NT28 \u2192 NT56\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT11 \u2192 't4'\n- NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68\n- NT75 \u2192 't60'\n\nWait, let's see where 't37' comes from. Looking at NT8's productions, does any of them produce 't37'? Let me check each option:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT59 NT58: NT59 is NT14 NT20. NT14 is 't40' (or does it produce something else?). Wait, looking at the grammar:\nLooking up NT14: NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90. So NT66 is NT56 (from NT56 \u2192 t40?), wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for where 't37' appears. Let me scan the entire grammar for any production that ends with 't37'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't36'\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT50 \u2192 't38'\n- NT90 \u2192 't56'\n- NT58 \u2192 't28'\n- NT73 \u2192 't75'\nWait, no 't37' appears in any production on the right-hand side. So NT8 might not be able to produce 't37' directly because none of its productions end with a terminal like 't37'.\n\nBut wait, NT8 \u2192 NT59 NT58. Let's see what NT59 and NT58 produce.\n\nNT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20.\nNT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90.\nNT66 \u2192 NT56 (since NT56 \u2192 't40')\nNT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68.\n\nThen NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33. NT2 \u2192 't36', NT33 \u2192 't1'. So NT91 produces 't36 t1'.\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28.\nNT54 \u2192 't16'\nNT28 \u2192 NT56 (which is 't40') or NT28 \u2192 't56'?\n\nWait, looking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT56 or NT28 \u2192 't56'?\n\nNo, sorry, looking at the grammar, under NT58: NT58 is listed as producing NT69 and NT18. Then NT69 is NT27, which isn't helpful. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Since the string starts with 't37', perhaps it's produced by a different non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT33: it's a non-terminal that produces 't1' directly, but maybe it's involved elsewhere.\n\nWait, earlier, for NT8 \u2192 NT59 NT58, and perhaps NT58 produces something that can generate 't37'. Let me check NT58:\n\nLooking at NT58: it can produce NT69 or NT18.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT58 \u2192 NT69 NT18, and NT18 \u2192 't47', while NT69 is NT27, which might not help. Alternatively, maybe NT58 is part of another chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't37' is found in another non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking through the list of productions, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 ... etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't37' in the grammar, I don't see any production that directly yields 't37'. So perhaps NT8 producing 't37' is impossible, which suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a longer chain that eventually leads to 't37'. Let me think.\n\nWait, the initial step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string must be a concatenation of the derivations of NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, for the first part of the string, let's see if NT88 can generate the initial part.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nSo, after S, the first non-terminal is NT8, which must produce a sequence including 't37 t16...'\n\nBut as I saw earlier, NT8 leads to NT59 NT58. Then NT59 leads to NT14 NT20, and then NT14 leads to NT66 NT90, which are 't40' and other stuff.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's see if the string can be broken down into the parts that match the grammar's rules.\n\nThe string is: t37 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t56 t17 t23 t23 t23 t9 t20 t44 t55 t44 t53 t1 t17 t23 t57 t33 t44 t60.\n\nLooking at the start, t37. As I don't see any nonterminal directly producing t37, perhaps it's part of a longer chain.\n\nWait, looking again: the grammar has NT8 produce NT59 and NT58. Then NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20. NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90. NT66 \u2192 NT56 (which is 't40'), and NT90 \u2192 NT91 NT68.\n\nNT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33. NT2 is 't36', NT33 is 't1', so NT91 \u2192 t36 t1.\n\nThen NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4. NT33 is 't1', and NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look for alternative paths.\n\nLooking at the third t30: that's a 't30' token in the string. Checking the grammar, perhaps NT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69. NT7 is 't2', NT69 is 't27', which produces 't5' or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't30' comes from a terminal in another rule. Looking for 't30' in the grammar: I see NT90 \u2192 't23' (as per NT90 \u2192 NT41 NT40, but that's not directly 't30').\n\nWait, perhaps 't30' is part of NT53's production?

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is a non-terminal deriving exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, except for the start symbol which can derive one. The start symbol is S, and looking at the first production, S -> NT88 NT26. So S must derive NT88 and NT26. Therefore, the string must start with NT88 and NT26. But in the input string, the first token is t6, which is a terminal. Wait, but in the grammar, NT88 is a non-terminal. So unless NT88 can produce t6, I can't start with t6. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, NT8 -> t29, NT9 -> t56, etc. But looking for t6, I see NT8 -> t29. Oh, wait, is there any non-terminal that can produce t6 other than NT8. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT75 -> t60\n- NT51 -> t39\n- NT40 -> t6\n- NT20 -> t51\n- NT8 -> t29\n- NT1 -> t4 (but I don't see NT1 as a terminal here)\n- etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t6. Let me see if any rule produces t6. Looking at the rules, NT40 -> t6. So perhaps NT40 can produce t6. But in the start, S is NT88 and NT26, so I need to derive t6 somehow from NT40. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the structure. The string starts with t6, which is a terminal, so the first non-terminal in S's expansion must derive t6. But looking at the S production: S -> NT88 NT26. So after S, it must produce two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26. So both of these need to produce a terminal string, and the concatenation of their productions must be the start of our input string.\n\nWait no, in context-free grammars, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals until they all are terminals. So if S -> NT88 NT26, then NT88 and NT26 will each expand to their respective strings. So the overall process is about expanding S into a sequence of NTs, which further expand into terminals.\n\nBut the start symbol S is a single non-terminal. So when S is derived, it becomes NT88 NT26, which are two separate non-terminals. So each has their own expansions. So the string we get will be the concatenation of the terminals produced by NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo our string starts with t6. So either NT88 produces t6, or NT26 produces t6, but both would need their other parts to fit into the sequence.\n\nLet me check the grammar again. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT88's production: the grammar rules include NT88 -> NT54 NT60.\n\nWait, no, the grammar has NT88 -> NT88 NT something? Wait, no, let me look again.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nThe initial lines show S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT88 isn't written as a terminal, only as non-terminals. So NT88 leads to other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\nNT8->t29,\n\nNT40->t6,\n\nNT70->t12,\n\nNT8->t29,\n\nNT5->t4,\n\nNT11->t4,\n\nNo, wait, looking for where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. From the given grammar:\n\n- NT8 -> t29\n\n- NT40 -> t6\n\n- NT9 -> t56\n\n- NT51 -> t39\n\n- NT80 is not present; wait, let me parse the grammar lines correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar lines are a bit jumbled. Let me list out the rules where a non-terminal is immediately followed by a terminal:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\n\nNT9 -> 't56'\n\nNT40 -> 't6'\n\nNT70 -> 't12'\n\nNT18 -> 't47'\n\nNT90 -> 't56'\n\nNT75 -> 't60'\n\nNT51 -> 't39'\n\nNT86 -> 't9'\n\nNT83 -> 't52'\n\nNT33 -> 't1'\n\nNT48 -> 't27'\n\nNT11 -> 't21'\n\nNT7 -> 't2'\n\nNT70 -> 't11'\n\nNT8 -> 't29'\n\nNT11 -> 't17'\n\nNT69 -> 't27'\n\nAnd so on until the end of the rules. So the non-terminals that directly produce terminals are:\n\nNT8 -> t29\n\nNT9 -> t56\n\nNT40 -> t6\n\nNT70 -> t12\n\nNT18 -> t47\n\nNT90 -> t56\n\nNT75 -> t60\n\nNT51 -> t39\n\nNT86 -> t9\n\nNT83 -> t52\n\nNT33 -> t1\n\nNT48 -> t27\n\nNT11 -> t21\n\nNT7 -> t2\n\nNT70 -> t11\n\nNT8 -> t29\n\nNT11 -> t17\n\nNT69 -> t27\n\nSo from the start, S is NT88 and NT26. Both of these are non-terminals, so their production rules must be processed.\n\nFirst, I need to see if NT88 can derive a terminal string, and similarly for NT26. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT88 is derived as:\n\nLooking for NT88 in the production rules. Checking:\n\n- NT88 isn't directly a terminal, so it must be broken down into other NTs. Looking through the rules, the only production for NT88 is:\n\nWait, I think I may have missed some. Let me check.\n\nWait, the initial lines show S->NT88 NT26.\n\nThen I'm looking for NT88 somewhere. Wait, in the given rules, I don't immediately see NT88 as a non-terminal. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules as provided:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nThen the grammar continues with multiple production lines. Let me see if NT88 is any of these.\n\nLooking through, I see NT88 is not directly defined because when I look at the rules, the only NT88 I see is in the S production. Then further down, I see rules like NT48 -> t27, but not NT88. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me go through each production line:\n\nAfter S, the first line is NT63 -> NT48 NT87.\n\nThen NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nNT41 -> NT77 NT18.\n\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58.\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79.\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22.\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22.\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83.\n\nNT51 -> NT70 NT94.\n\nNT13 -> NT7 NT69.\n\nNT2 -> NT87 NT70.\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4.\n\nNT17 -> NT63 NT50.\n\nNT91 -> NT2 NT33.\n\nNT79 -> NT22 NT48.\n\nNT59 -> NT14 NT20.\n\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42.\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28.\n\nNT17 -> NT42 NT87.\n\nNT98 -> NT41 NT40.\n\nNT13 -> NT58 NT83.\n\nNT14 -> NT66 NT90.\n\nNT13 -> NT85 NT40.\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18.\n\nNT7 -> NT59 NT58.\n\nNT48 -> NT59 NT98.\n\nNT7 -> NT87 NT97.\n\nNT87 -> NT76 NT35.\n\nNT90 -> NT91 NT68.\n\nNT98 -> NT86 NT4.\n\nNT13 -> NT53 NT33.\n\nNT20 -> NT51 NT72.\n\nNT18 -> NT66 NT55.\n\nNT70 -> NT15 NT15?

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has rules that produce two non-terminals or a terminal. Since the grammar's rules are a bit complex, I'll start by understanding the structure and working backwards from the given string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t11 t1 t16 t56 t11 t23 t33 t1 t44 t36 t47 t30 t8 t60 t55 t44 t53 t1 t20 t44 t6`\n\nFirst, I notice that the string consists of a series of tokens that could be either terminals (like 't54', 't60', etc.) or non-terminals. In CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left. So, the start symbol is S, which is `S -> NT88 NT26`. This means that the entire string must expand starting with NT88 and NT26, and each of these can further expand until we reach terminals.\n\nI'll approach this by parsing the string to see if it can be derived from the start rules. Since the grammar is in CNF and all productions are two symbols, I can use a recursive descent approach or look for possible derivations step by step.\n\nStarting with S, the first two symbols should be the result of NT88 and NT26. So, I'll split the string into possible pairs that correspond to NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT88 is `S -> NT88 NT26`. Let's see what NT88 and NT26 expand to. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, NT88 is not a non-terminal; it's a terminal because in the rules provided, I see that NT88 is never the left-hand side (LHS) of any production except in S, which is a terminal? Wait no, wait: looking back, the rules have NT88 appearing as a component in other rules. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see that some of the right-hand sides (RHS) are terminals, like for example, in `NT58 -> NT33 NT4`, which eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, for example, `NT88 -> NT88 NT32` is not present\u2014let me check. No, actually, looking through the rules, NT88 only appears in the RHS of other non-terminals, but as a terminal, I think. Wait, no, no\u2014it might not be a non-terminal. Let me see.\n\nThe grammar is a bit complex. I think the first step is to analyze each symbol in the string and see which non-terminals they are derived from.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a tree starting from the start symbol and see if the string matches any possible derivation.\n\nLet me first list the string: `t54 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t11 t1 t16 t56 t11 t23 t33 t1 t44 t36 t47 t30 t8 t60 t55 t44 t53 t1 t20 t44 t6`\n\nI have 32 tokens here. Let's see how they can be split into pairs, since each production is two symbols.\n\nStart with the first pair: t54 t60. Looking at the grammar, let's see if any rule produces t54 and t60. Or, perhaps, if t54 is a non-terminal and t60 is another, check what they can produce.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for pairs in the string and see if they can match any production.\n\nLooking through the rules, let's map each terminal to its possible non-terminals.\n\nFor example, 't1' is produced by NT33.\n't2' is from several places, like NT7, NT22, NT20, etc.\n't3' could be NT88? Wait, no, looking back, NT88 is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should go through each token and see what non-terminals they can come from.\n\nLet's list each token and possible rules:\n\nt54: From NT18 (looking through rules, NT18 has `NT18 -> NT54 NT2`), also NT74 is not present. Wait, looking for NT55 and NT18. Hmm, in the rules, `NT88 -> NT8 NT32`, but that produces 't8' and 't32'. Also, 't54' comes from NT33 (as `NT33 -> 't1'` but that might not be relevant. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me go through each token in the string and see what non-terminals produce them.\n\n1. t54: Looking through the rules, I see NT33 -> 't1', but that's not t54. Wait, perhaps 't54' comes from NT54 via a production that doesn't seem to be listed. Wait, in the provided rules, I don't see any NT54 production. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking again, in the given grammar's rules, 't54' is produced by NT17. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, `NT58 -> NT33 NT4` may result in 't54'? Wait, no, perhaps NT17 -> 't29' or 't28'\u2014I need to see which non-terminals produce these.\n\nAlternatively, I might be overcomplicating this. Maybe I should approach this step by step, trying to build a parse tree from the start symbol.\n\nStart with S, which is NT88 NT26. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: the first symbols corresponding to NT88 and the remaining for NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part of the string would be the expansion of NT88, and then the second part is the expansion of NT26.\n\nBut I don't know what NT88 and NT26 expand to in terms of non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, let's look for NT88 and NT26 on the LHS:\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n- NT33 -> 't1'\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n- NT58 -> 't11'\n- NT77 -> 't60'\n- NT75 -> 't60'\n- NT66 -> 't30'\n- NT35 -> 't44'\n- NT55 -> 't54'\nWait, wait. Look for NT88 in the rules. The start symbol is S -> NT88 NT26. But in the given rules, the LHS of each production is always a non-terminal, except S since S is the start symbol. Wait, but in the provided rules, I see that NT88 is a RHS, not an LHS. So, in the grammar, NT88 is a non-terminal that can produce, for example, NT17 NT58, etc. But in the given list of rules, I don't see NT88 as an LHS, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.\n\nWait, actually, let me make sure. Looking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4\n\nSo, NT88 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by NT8 and NT32, which in turn produce certain terminals.\n\nSo, the approach is to use these rules recursively to see if the string can be derived.\n\nGiven that, the start is S = NT88 NT26. So, let's see what the string starts with.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t54 and t60. Now, since S = NT88 NT26, let's see what each of these could be:\n\n- The first part, t54, must come from NT88 expanding into t54 and something else. But looking at the rules, NT88 can expand to NT8 and NT32, which would produce 't8' and 't32', not 't54'. So maybe the first part is more than two symbols, or perhaps t54 comes from a deeper expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string has to be derived through a series of rule applications. Let me try to break it down.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to split it into possible pairs from the start.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backwards from the start. Let me see:\n\nThe start S = NT88 NT26. So, the string must begin with the expansion of NT88 followed by NT26.\n\nLet me see what NT26 expands to. Looking at the rules, NT26 is replaced by NT68 NT13.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is: `t54 t27 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t17 t1 t16 t25 t20 t1 t44 t34 t30 t52 t30 t54 t60 t55 t44 t38 t1 t39 t38 t44 t6`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what I know about Chomsky Normal Form. In CNF, each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure helps in analyzing the grammar using parsers that handle CNF, such as the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not supposed to use any specific parser here, I'll approach it by trying to find possible derivation steps.\n\nThe given grammar consists of multiple production rules, both non-terminals (NT) and terminals. The non-terminals have various productions, some ending in terminals, others further expanding into more non-terminals. Terminals include t's with numbers, like t54, t27, etc., which are leaves in the parse tree.\n\nMy approach is to see if the string can be produced by the grammar. To do this, I can represent the string as a sequence of terminals and see if each can be derived by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, I'll list all the terminals:\n\nt54, t27, t18, t16, t25, t30, t55, t44, t23, t17, t1, t16, t25, t20, t1, t44, t34, t30, t52, t30, t54, t60, t55, t44, t38, t1, t39, t38, t44, t6.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule either produces one terminal or two non-terminals. This suggests that the parse tree for any string would be a binary tree, with each non-terminal expanding into two sub-productions.\n\nI'll start by checking if the entire string can be built starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S has the production rule: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So S must derive to the combination of NT88 and NT26 expanding to the string. Since S is the top symbol, the entire string must be built from the two branches of NT88 and NT26.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Actually, in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), the productions are such that the entire left-hand side (LHS) must derive into exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So the grammar's start symbol must derive into the entire string in a few steps. Since S \u2192 NT88 NT26, each of those NTs must eventually derive into sequences that, when combined, form the entire string.\n\nSo I need to check whether the string can be partitioned into two parts, one derived from NT88 and the other from NT26.\n\nLet me see the length of the string: 34 tokens. Since each step in CNF can only expand into two non-terminals, the parsing tree would be binary, and the total number of symbols (terminals and non-terminals) in the parse tree would be length + (depth-1), but since I don't have a specific depth, this might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to look for each terminal in the string and see which production rules produce them, then trace back.\n\nLet's take the string tokens one by one and see if they can be matched to any production in the grammar.\n\nFirst token: t54. Checking the grammar, looking for NTs that produce t54.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\n- NT66: t30\n- NT55: t8, t52\n- NT52: t14, t50\nWait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, let me scan the rules for each NT and see if any produce t54.\n\nLooking through the rules provided:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t54.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT55: 't52'\n- NT58: t28\nWait, no t54. Let me check each NT rule:\n\nWait, scanning:\n\n- NT88: t54\nWait, here's the rule: NT88 \u2192 t56. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, NT86: t56\nWait, NT51: 't39'\n\nWait, going through all the NTs:\n\n- NT32 \u2192 t73, t42\n- NT68 \u2192 t56, t28\n- NT58 \u2192 t33, t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t63, t50 \u2192 but t63? Or wait, looking for t54.\n\nWait, looking for NTs that produce t54.\n\nWait, in the provided rules:\n\nI don't immediately see any NT that directly produces t54. Let me scan all NTs to see if they have t54 in their production:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT88: t54\nOh, yes! NT88 \u2192 t54.\n\nWait, no, looking in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking carefully, the rule for NT58 is: NT58 \u2192 NT33, NT4. No t54.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it.

But in the same production, it's either-or, depending on which part is taken first.\n\nThis seems a bit conflicting.

{"custom_id":"request-562","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the productions build up the string step by step. My task is to check if the given string can be derived from S following the grammar rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t16 t56 t15 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t56 t23 t23 t57 t33 t1 t44 t55 t44 t23 t23 t47 t30 t8 t60 t26 t60 t55 t44 t53 t28 t6`.\n\nBut looking closely, I notice that most of the words in the string are 't' followed by numbers. In the grammar, certain non-terminals produce these 't' strings. For example, NT87 can produce 't27', NT48 can produce 't27', NT7 can produce 't2', etc.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from the end and use a top-down reduction approach, starting from S and attempting to derive the string. Alternatively, since the string is long, I might need a more systematic way.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string is a leftmost derivation from S. But given the complexity of the string, this might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the string using the given productions. Let me look for the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the productions:\nS -> NT88 NT26.\n\nSo, S directly produces NT88 NT26. Each of these must produce parts of the string.\n\nLet's see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42\nNT73 -> 't27' (from the last line)\nNT42 -> 't18'\n\nSo, NT88 -> NT8 NT32 -> ... but wait, NT32 is a terminal in some cases? No, wait. NT32 itself is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, NT32 has productions:\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42\nNow, NT73 -> 't27'\nNT42 -> 't18'\nSo, NT32 -> 't27' 't18'\n\nBut wait, 't27 t18' would be the result of NT32.\n\nWait, but looking back at the string, the beginning is t37. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for the longest possible substrings in the given string that match the production results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't be derived because it starts with t37. Let me see what produces t37.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t37 comes from NT86. Because in the last line: NT86 -> t9, but not directly. Wait, in the grammar, NT86 isn't listed. Wait, the lines show NT96 -> t something? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking through the productions, I don't see a production for NT86. Wait, perhaps t37 comes from another NT? Let me check.\n\nSearching for 't37', it's generated by NT86 according to line: NT86 -> t9, but wait, I don't see that in the provided grammar. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, the last line is NT88 -> t32. So maybe I'm missing the t37 production. Alternatively, I might have to check the list again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT88 -> NT8 NT32, but I don't see any NT mentioned that produces 't37' directly. So perhaps t37 is part of a larger production.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar, the only t's are from specific non-terminals. So maybe t37 is a terminal only if a non-terminal produces it. Is there a non-terminal that directly produces 't37'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT57 -> 't45'\n- NT30 -> 't16', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't37'. Hmm, that's a problem. Because in the string, the first symbol is 't37'. If no NT directly produces 't37', then it's impossible for 't37' to be in the string. So perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again the productions.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- There's NT83 -> 't52'\n- NT42 -> 't18'\n- NT28 -> 't56'\n- NT40 -> 't6'\n- NT66 -> 't30'\n- NT13 -> 't12'\n- NT57 -> 't45'\n- NT50 -> 't38'\n- NT77 -> 't33'\n- NT91 -> 't44'\n- NT88 -> 't32'\n\nWait, nowhere do I see a production that directly results in 't37'. So if that's the case, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't37', but no non-terminal in the given grammar directly produces 't37'.

The grammar is provided, and the string to check is `t6 t27 t18 t16 t56 t15 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t56 t20 t1 t44 t15 t9 t39 t33 t44 t47 t60 t47 t60 t55 t44 t38 t1 t20 t44 t6`. \n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in CNF has productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nThe string starts with `t6`, so I'll look at the grammar to see which non-terminals can produce `t6`. Looking through the right-hand sides, I notice a few productions where terminals appear:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12, but NT12 isn't in the start, so I think about which NTs can lead to `t6`. Wait, there's NT12 \u2192 t17, but that's not `t6`.\n- Wait, looking further, I see NT70 \u2192 t12 t12? No, let me check again. Wait, in the grammar, there's NT70 \u2192 t12? Actually, no, I see that NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12, but looking through the list, I see NT70 \u2192 t17 is not present. Wait, let's scan the list carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4\n- NT12? Wait, the list starts with NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4, then looking for t6.

Wait, the actual productions are:\n\nWait, the productions are:\n\nLooking through all productions, looking for those ending with a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12: So, the RHS is two non-terminals, NT12 and NT12. NT12's production is NT12 \u2192 t17, which is a terminal and a single one. So NT70 can produce t17 + t17, i.e., 't17t17'.\n\nWait, but looking for t6, I see:\n\n- Not directly seeing an NT that directly goes to t6. Hmm, perhaps via another NT.\n\nWait, maybe checking each production. Let me go through each RHS and see which give t6.\n\nLooking through all the RHSes:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 NT70 NT94: NT70 can lead to NT12 NT12, which is t17 t17. So this would be t17 t17 t94, none is t6.\n- NT7 \u2192 NT59 NT58: NT59 \u2192 NT14 NT20, so t59 and t58, which may not be t6.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22: NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72, NT72 \u2192 NT76 NT35. Doesn't seem to produce t6.\n- NT28 \u2192 NT56 NT4: nt56 gives t18, so nt28 produces t56 t4, which is t18 t4.\n- NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50: nt63 \u2192 nt48 nt87, nt50 \u2192 t53 (which is 't53'), so nt17 produces t48 t87 t53.\n- NT91 \u2192 NT2 NT33: nt2 \u2192 t36; nt33 \u2192 t1, so t36 t1.\n- NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48: nt22 \u2192 t44, nt48 \u2192 t27, so t44 t27.\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4 \u2192 t1 t4 (t1 and t4? nt4's production is nt4 \u2192 nt20 nt22, which is t51 and t44. So nt58 would be t1 t4, which would lead to t1 t51 t44, which is t1 t51 t44. That doesn't include t6.\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's see the string: the first word is t6. So I need to find a production that can produce t6. Or perhaps a series of productions leading to t6 via intermediate NTs.\n\nLooking through the productions for terminals, I see that some NTs produce single terminals:\n\nLooking for any production where RHS is a single terminal, but all productions I see have either two NTs or a terminal followed by another term or two NTs.\n\nWait, let me list all the productions where RHS is a single terminal:\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, all RHSs are either two NTs or two terminals or a mix?\n\nWait no, in CNF, each production's RHS is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So I think the grammar provided will have only single-terminals as terminals, or two NTs. Let me scan the productions.\n\nLooking through all productions in the grammar:\n\nFor example, NT70 \u2192 t12? Wait, looking through, I don't see a production where the RHS is a single terminal other than 't' followed by numbers. So for example, NT70 \u2192 t12 is not a production; instead, NT70 is \u2192 NT12 NT12, which are two NTs.\n\nSo all the terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers, like t6, t27, etc. So to produce t6, we need a production where a non-terminal can directly produce t6.\n\nBut I don't see any productions in the grammar where an NT directly maps to t6. For example, looking for NT \u2192 t6. Is there any production with RHS t6?\n\nLooking through the list: No. All terminal symbols are more than one character, such as t27, t18, etc. Wait, no, actually, the RHS can be a single 't' followed by a number, like t27, t18, etc. But that's allowed because 't' is a terminal symbol, and 27 is part of the string, meaning each character is a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, no, in a CFG, the RHS can be a single terminal, which can be a single character. So the NT producing 't6' must have a production where it directly goes to 't6'. So in the current grammar, is there any NT with a production that directly results in 't6'?\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking for any line that has RHS 't6'. The given grammar has:\n\nLooking through all the lines:\n\nAt line 44: NT42 \u2192 t18.\n\nOther lines, like:\n\nLooking for 't6' anywhere in RHS. Hmm.\n\nWait, I see NT48 \u2192 t27 in line 40.\n\nBut I don't see any NT being produced to 't6', like NT__ \u2192 t6. So perhaps the grammar doesn't have a production that directly produces 't6'\u2014it's always through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong because maybe the parsing can go through multiple steps to reach 't6'. Let's think again.\n\nWait, if I can't find any NT producing 't6', then perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Because all the NTs either produce two non-terminals or two terminals, but to get a single terminal like 't6', there must be a production that can directly do that.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is 't6', which is a single terminal. So in the grammar, at least one NT must have a production that directly produces 't6'. If that's not the case, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, so let me double-check all the productions for any that have RHS as 't6'. For example, looking through the list:\n\nI see NT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22: So that's two NTs.\n\nLooking for any NT that produces 't6' through a single production.\n\nWait, I see NT53: NT53 \u2192 NT48 NT20 in line 43.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me list all the NT productions:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT88 NT26\n2. NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87\n3.

{"custom_id":"request-586","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies things a bit because each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go to terminals.\n\nFirst off, the string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is either a terminal ('t' followed by a number or 'NT' followed by a number) or a non-terminal. But looking at the grammar, I notice that all the productions are of the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwv, which means every right-hand side has exactly two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, looking again, maybe I'm mixing it up. Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to be either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this case, the grammar seems to have productions like NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, which fits the form NTxy \u2192 NTxz NTwv. So each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t23 t17 t1 t16 t25 t11 t23 t38 t1 t44 t55 t44 t23 t23 t26 t30 t8 t6 t55 t44 t53 t1 t39 t23 t44 t6`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol S is defined as S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which are both non-terminals, so the string must start with the terminals that NT88 and NT26 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT87\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo S starts with NT88 \u2192 NT83 and NT87. Then each of those needs to be expanded.\n\nLet's break down the string step by step. Each token must be the result of expanding a non-terminal.\n\nFirst, let's parse the string and see if it can be split into a leftmost derivation that matches the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t37, t16, t56, t30, t55, t44, t23, t17, t1, t16, t25, t11, t23, t38, t1, t44, t55, t44, t23, t23, t26, t30, t8, t6, t55, t44, t53, t1, t39, t23, t44, t6.\n\nWe'll need to check each production step from the start symbol S.\n\nStep 1: S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the entire string must start with NT88 and NT26 expanding into a sequence that starts with the first terminal t37.\n\nLooking at NT88: NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT87 (from production rule). Then, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded.\n\nWhat does NT83 produce? Looking at the grammar, NT83 is produced by:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT79 NT22\n\nWait, that's not NT83. Let me check again. The user input had a line NT83 \u2192 't52'. So NT83 is a terminal, right? Because in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals, like:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT83 NT87, but NT83 is replaced by 't52'. So wait, actually, NT83 produces a terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT83. The grammar has:\n\nNT53 \u2192 't48'\nNT50 \u2192 't38'\nNT41 \u2192 't49'\nNT2 \u2192 't34'\nNT40 \u2192 't60'\nNT20 \u2192 't20'\n\nAnd others like NT83 \u2192 't52'?\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, but it's a bit hard to parse quickly. Let me look for NT83 production.\n\nIn the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\nNT28 \u2192 't25'\nNT48 \u2192 't27'\nNT11 \u2192 't21'\nNT69 \u2192 't27'\nNT50 \u2192 't38'\nNT35 \u2192 't44'\nNT58 \u2192 't11'\nNT11 \u2192 't27' (Wait, conflicting; actually, looking again, no, the user's grammar for NT11 is:\n\n\"NT11 -> 't4'\", which seems to be a terminal, not a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, looking at the grammar, it has some rules like:\n\n\"NT7 -> 't2'\", \"NT8 -> 't29'\", \"NT90 -> 't56'\", etc. These must mean that the NT on the left produces a terminal.\n\nSo, the grammar seems to have both non-terminals and terminals. The NT's on the left of an arrow are non-terminals, and if they produce a terminal (like \"NT7 -> 't2'\"), then they are terminals. If a rule is something like \"NT63 -> NT48 NT87\", then both sides are non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the start symbol S is NT88 NT26. So S starts with NT88 and NT26.\n\nNow, expanding NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT87. So NT88 becomes NT83 NT87. Then, each of these can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT83: If NT83 has a production that produces a terminal, like \"NT83 -> 't52'\". So when we expand NT83, we get t52.\n\nSimilarly, NT87: Let's check if NT87 has a production. Looking through the grammar:\n\nNT87 \u2192 't44' perhaps? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking for NT87: The entries include NT72 \u2192 't33', NT55 \u2192 't54', etc. Wait, in the list, I see:\n\n\"NT87 -> 't47'\", perhaps? Let me check the grammar rules provided:\n\nLooking through, under NT87: The user wrote \"NT87 -> 't47'\". Wait, no, actually, the lines are:\n\n\"NT87 -> NT76 NT35\"\nSo that's a production rule, not a terminal. So NT87 is non-terminal and expands into NT76 and NT35.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread it. Let me check the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nFrom the user's grammar, here are some lines:\n\n\"NT76 -> 't55'\"?\nWait, let me find.\n\n\"NT28 -> 't56'\"\n\"NT17 -> 't29'\"\n\"NT55 -> 't52'\"\n\"NT55 -> 't54'\"\n\"NT58 -> 't11'\"\n\"NT77 -> 't49'\", etc.\n\nWait, perhaps more straightforwardly, perhaps the user made a typo in the grammar, but assuming that for NTs like NT83 and NT87, they might produce terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut given that the user's grammar has entries like \"NT7 -> 't2'\", \"NT8 -> 't29'\", these are terminal productions, meaning that NT7 is a terminal, and its value is 't2'.\n\nSo for NT83 and NT87, the user hasn't written \"NT83 -> 't...'\" or \"NT87 -> 't...'\", so perhaps they produce non-terminals, meaning we have to expand further.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check the first few lines.\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT88 NT26\n\nNT63 -> NT48 NT87\n\nNT26 -> NT68 NT13\n\nNT41 -> NT77 NT18\n\nNT85 -> NT17 NT58\n\nNT77 -> NT33 NT79\n\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22\n\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\n\nWait, actually, that's a production for NT73: NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83. So from that, NT73 can produce two non-terminals.\n\nBut in the question, in the string, I see a 't37' which is a terminal.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like every non-terminal symbol on the left side of the grammar's productions splits into two non-terminals on the right. That's typical for Chomsky normal form. Now, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals\u2014tokens like 't37', 't16', up until the end. So, my goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the grammar, S -> NT88 NT26. So, the first step is to expand S into NT88 and NT26. Now, each of these non-terminals needs to be expanded further. Let me look at NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88, it seems to split into NT8 and NT32. Wait, but in the string, we have 't37'. Let me check what NT8 expands into. Hmm, in the grammar, looking at the productions, NS8... Hmm, I don't see any entries for NT8 in the productions. Wait, no, actually looking through the productions:\n\n- NT8 is mentioned in the production NT58 -> NT33 NT4. And NT48 -> NT2 NT18, among others. Wait, I don't see NT8 being a production. So maybe NT8 itself is not a non-terminal in the grammar's left-hand side. So, if NT8 is on the right side, maybe it's a terminal? But wait, in the grammar's productions, every left-hand side is a non-terminal, so NT8 must be a terminal if it doesn't appear on the left. Hmm, but in the string, we have 't37', which might correspond to NT8?\n\nWait, no. Let me check the string again: the first token is 't37'. So, in the grammar, I need to see if 't37' is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT88 -> NT8 NT32. So, NT8 must be a terminal because it's on the right side without being a non-terminal on the left. Wait, no, in NT58's production, we have NT58 -> NT33 NT4, and 4 could be a terminal if it's not present on the left. So, perhaps 4 is a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse this as a symbol string where each token is a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of symbols, each like 't37', 't16', etc. My job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nSo, let's think about how to derive the given string. Starting from S, which produces NT88 and NT26. So, the string must start with the symbols from NT88 followed by NT26.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first symbol is 't37'. Let me check what NT88 produces. From the grammar, NT88 is part of the production NT88 -> NT8 NT32. Wait, but looking through the productions, I don't see a direct entry for NT88 as a left-hand side. So, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- S -> NT88 NT26\n\nThen, looking for NT88: no, there's no production for NT88 on the left side. Wait, that can't be right. Did I miss something? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look for 't37' as a symbol.\n\nWait, maybe in the productions, NT58 is part of multiple productions. Let me see. For example, NT58 -> NT33 NT4. So, 4 might be a terminal. Similarly, NT48 -> NT2 NT18, so '18' might be a terminal.\n\nIn the string, 't37' is present. Let me look for a production for NT37. Hmm, I don't see any NT37 in the grammar. Wait, maybe I should consider that the 't's followed by numbers are terminals, and the numbers in the productions are non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's think more carefully. Each production in the grammar is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So, the string consists of terminal symbols, each of which is a 't' followed by a number. So, in the given string, 't37' is a terminal symbol. The non-terminals in the grammar are identified by NT followed by a number, like NT88, NT48, etc.\n\nSo, when we have a production like NT88 -> NT8 NT32, this means that whenever we have NT88, it can be rewritten into NT8 followed by NT32.\n\nNow, in the given string, the first symbol is 't37'. This must appear as a terminal in one of the productions. Let me check the right-hand sides (RHS) of all productions to see if 't37' is a terminal. From the productions given, I see:\n\n- 't37' doesn't appear as a terminal in any RHS.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. Because if NT88 is expanded into NT8 and NT32, and in the string, we have 't37' as the first symbol, then NT8 must produce 't37' as a terminal.\n\nSo, is there a production for NT8? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the RHS entries, for example:\n\n- NT58 -> NT33 NT4 (so 't4' is a terminal)\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18 (so 't18' is a terminal)\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- ... etc.\n\nHmm, looking through all the RHS entries, I don't see any 't's except for 't2', 't4', 't6', 't8', 't11', 't12', 't13', 't14', 't15', 't16', 't17', 't18', 't19', 't20', 't21', 't22', 't23', 't25', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't29', 't30', 't32', 't33', 't35', 't36', 't37', ... etc. Wait, yes, 't37' is present in some productions? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the RHS entries:\n\n- NT69 -> NT27\n- NT87 -> NT27\n- NT28 -> 't56'\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Wait, in the RHS of some non-terminals:\n\nAh, looking back:\n\nWait, for NT55 -> NT14 NT20. Wait, no, perhaps I misread. Let me go through each RHS:\n\n- NT48: has 't2', 't18'\n- NT77: 't33', 't79'\n- NT85: 't17', 't58'\n- NT77: 't33', 't79'\n- NT7: 't11', 't22'\n- NT4: 't20', 't22'\n- NT73: 't75', 't83'\n- NT51: 't70', 't94'\n- NT13: 't7', 't69'\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, I see that 't37' isn't in any RHS. So, that suggests that NT88's first part is NT8, which must produce 't37' as a terminal. But where is the production for NT8? It's not present anywhere in the RHS as a terminal. Therefore, NT8 must be a terminal, but it's also a non-terminal on the LHS.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the grammar, a non-terminal can only expand into other non-terminals, not terminals. Wait, wait, perhaps I should re-examine: all the productions in the grammar are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, except for those that expand into terminals. Wait, in the RHS, some entries have 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals.\n\nWait, let me confirm: for every production in the grammar, it's A -> B C where B and C are non-terminals on the left. No, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, there are both types: some productions are two non-terminals on the RHS, and some might directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the RHS in the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18.

I'm not very experienced with this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. All the production rules are in the form A -> BC, except for the ones that produce terminals like 't1', 't2', etc. Each non-terminal on the left side of the rules produces exactly two other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. The start symbol is S, which first becomes NT88 and NT26 based on the production S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nNow, looking at the string to evaluate: it's a series of tokens separated by spaces. It starts with 't29', which is a terminal. So, I need to see if any non-terminal production ends with 't29'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT17 has two productions: NT17 -> NT77 NT58 and NT17 -> NT42 NT87. Also, in the terminals list, NT17 is replaced by 't29'.\n\nSo, if NT17 is part of the parse, it can produce 't29'. That's a good sign because the string starts with 't29', so one of the non-terminals must derive that.\n\nNext, the string is long, so I need to track the entire derivation process. Let's break it down token by token.\n\n1. The first token is 't29', which comes from NT17. So, in the derivation, there must be a step where NT17 is expanded to 't29'.\n\n2. The string continues with 't60'. Looking for productions that produce 't60'. Checking the terminals, NT51 is replaced by 't39' and NT2 is replaced by 't36'. NT50 is 't38', NT35 is 't44', etc. Hmm, 't60' is not directly a terminal. Wait, maybe it's part of a non-terminal production. Looking at the grammar, I see NT75 -> 't60'. So, if a non-terminal NT75 expands to 't60', that could be where it comes from.\n\n3. The third token is 't52'. Looking for production that leads to 't52'. Checking the terminals, NT35 is 't44', NT15 (assuming based on rules like NT59 -> NT15) is 't52'? Wait, looking at the rules: NT15 is mentioned as 't52' under NT59. So NT59 -> 't59' and 't52'. Wait, actually, looking at the given grammar, I see NT59 -> NT14 NT20, and NT14 is 't66', NT20 is 't51'. NT51 is 't39'. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check again. \n\nIn the grammar, the terminals section lists NT59 -> 't15' and NT58 -> 't28', among others. Wait, actually, looking at the specific lines:\n\nLooking for NT52, I see that NT14 -> 't66', NT20 -> 't51', NT58 -> 't28', etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look through the terminal mappings to find 't60'. \n\nLooking at the terminal list:\n\n- NT51 -> 't39'\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT40 -> 't60' (Wait, yes! NT40 is replaced by 't60'. So if a non-terminal NT40 expands to 't60', that's the source. So token 't60' must come from NT40.\n\nWait, no, the string has 't60' as the third token, which is after 't29' (NT17). So in the derivation, after expanding NT17 to 't29', the next step would involve the other part of NT17's production. NT17 can be either NT77 NT58 or NT42 NT87. Since we're dealing with a leftmost derivation, let's pick one possibility.\n\nAssuming we picked the first production, NT17 -> NT77 NT58. So after NT17 becomes 't29', we then need to derive NT77 and NT58.\n\nNT77 is 't44' according to the terminal mappings under NT77. So NT77 -> 't44'. Then NT58 -> 't11' according to the terminal mappings (NT11 -> 't17'). So that would be 't44' and 't17' in some order. But in the string, the next token after 't29' is 't60' (third token), which doesn't fit. So maybe the other production of NT17 is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should look for how each token in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nString: t29 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t17 t17 t1 t16 t56 t39 t23 t1 t44 t30 t56 t39 t38 t45 t47 t6 t55 t44 t53 t1 t39 t32 t44 t60\n\nWait, actually, the string starts with 't29 t60 t52...'. So I'll break it down:\n\n1. 't29' must come from NT17, as we saw earlier.\n\nSo starting with S -> NT88 NT26.\n\nNT88 -> 't8' 't32'). Wait, looking at the terminal mappings: NT88 is 't8' and NT32 is 't32'. So S produces t8 and t32. But wait, the string starts with t29, not t8 or t32. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe I've made a mistake. S should produce NT88 and NT26. Let's check the productions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nNT88 -> NT17 NT32.\n\nWait, in the terminal mappings, NT17 -> 't29' and NT32 -> 't56'. So S -> NT88 NT26 would be t17 (t29) and NT32 (t56), i.e., 't29 t56'. But the string starts with t29, followed by t60. Hmm, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, so the first two symbols from S are t29 and t56, but the given string starts with t29 and t60. So maybe the order is different. Alternatively, perhaps NT26 produces something else.\n\nWait, let's check NT26's productions. NT26 -> NT68 NT13. Both of these are non-terminals. Let's see what they expand to.\n\nNT68 -> NT54 NT28.\n\nNT54 is a terminal? Looking at the terminal mappings, no, NT54 isn't a terminal. Wait, checking the terminal list, NT54 is replaced by 't16' under NT54. But wait, in the provided grammar, under the terminal mappings, 't16' is NT54. So NT54 -> 't16'.\n\nSimilarly, NT28 -> NT25 NT46. Wait, checking the terminal list: NT25 is 't25' and NT46 is 't27' under NT28.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's approach this differently.\n\nThe string starts with 't29' followed by 't60'. So to get 't29', we need a production that ends with NT17 -> 't29'. Then, after that, the 't60' would have to come from some production derived from the other part of NT17's expansion.\n\nBut wait, S -> NT88 NT26. Let's check the productions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nNT88 -> NT17 NT32.\n\nNT17 -> 't29' (as terminal), and NT32 -> 't32'?\n\nWait, looking back at the terminal mappings, I see NT32 -> 't32' under NT32. So if NT88 -> NT17 NT32, that would produce 't29' and 't32'. But the string starts with 't29 t60', not 't29 t32'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT26 is producing something else.

{"custom_id":"request-600","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite extensive, so I need to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, let me understand the components involved. The grammar is CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. However, looking at the provided grammar, I notice some rules have two non-terminals on the right side, like S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Also, some rules have a non-terminal followed by a terminal, such as NT58 -> NT69 NT18, where 18 is a terminal 't18'. This suggests that the grammar might actually be in a slightly different form or perhaps has some mixed rules. Wait, but the initial statement says it's in CNF, so maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps some rules are in the form of two non-terminals, which is allowed in CNF, and others may have a mix. Alternatively, maybe the grammar uses symbols that include multiple terminals, but since all productions in CNF must have two non-terminals or a single terminal, I'll proceed with that in mind.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t15 t1 t44 t30 t34 t1 t16 t25 t20 t1 t44 t15 t49 t6 t26 t6 t30 t54 t60 t55 t44 t53 t1 t39 t32 t44 t6`\n\nI need to parse this string using the given grammar, checking if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is quite complex with many productions, manually trying to parse the string might be tedious. Instead, I can look for the symbols in the string and see which productions correspond to them and the context in which they appear.\n\nLet me list the terminal symbols in the string to make it easier:\nt6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t15, t1, t44, t30, t34, t1, t16, t25, t20, t1, t44, t15, t49, t6, t26, t6, t30, t54, t60, t55, t44, t53, t1, t39, t32, t44, t6.\n\nFirst, let's see what symbols are in the grammar. The non-terminals are NT prefixes, so NT58, NT77, etc. The terminals are t followed by numbers, like t6, t15, etc.\n\nThe string starts with t6. Looking at the grammar rules, t6 is a terminal symbol. Let's see where t6 appears:\n\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT18 -> t47\n- NT11 -> t21\n- NT69 -> t27\n- NT18 also appears in NT94 -> t57, NT17 -> t29, etc.\n\nWait, let me find all the rules where a terminal like t6, t60, etc., appears on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT48 also has a rule NT48 -> NT7 -> t2, so perhaps that's a way to get t2.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t6. Let's find a non-terminal that can produce t6.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT28 -> t56, which isn't t6. NT17 -> t29, not t6. NT11 -> t21, not t6. NT22 -> t, but looking through, NT22 is a non-terminal, not a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find which non-terminals expand to t6. Let's search the rules:\n\n- NT28 -> t56\n- NT72 -> t44\n- NT91 -> t44\n- NT90 -> t9, which isn't relevant here.\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT2 -> t36\n- NT50 -> t38\n- NT54 -> t56\n- NT72 -> t33\n- NT22 -> t44\n- NT77 -> t3\n- Wait, no, NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n- NT33 -> t1\n- NT22 appears in some other rules, but I don't see a rule for it on the right-hand side producing a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each rule to see if any non-terminal on the right side leads to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules again:\n\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n   NT69 -> t27\n   NT18 -> t47\n   So NT58 can't produce t6.\n\n- NT77 -> NT33 NT79\n   NT33 -> t1\n   NT79 -> t48\n   So NT77 can't produce t6.\n\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n   NT22 is a non-terminal, so not helpful.\n\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n   NT2 is a non-terminal, and NT18 is also non-terminal, so no.\n\n- NT48 -> NT7 -> t2. Wait, there are two rules for NT48:\n   1. NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n   2. NT48 -> NT7 -> t2\n\nSo NT48 can produce the terminal t2, not t6.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t6. So I need a production that starts with t6. But in the grammar, all productions on the left-hand side (LHS) are non-terminals. So the string should start with non-terminals that eventually expand to terminals. So the first symbol in the string must be a terminal, which is produced by a non-terminal rule.\n\nSo the first symbol is t6, so we need to find a non-terminal that can expand to t6. Let me look through all the rules to find which production leads to t6.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT55 -> t44\n- NT58 -> NT69 NT18\n- NT18 -> t47\n- NT2 -> t36\n- NT40 -> t6\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT40 -> t6. Yes, that's a rule: NT40 -> t6.\n\nSo the non-terminal NT40 produces t6.\n\nSo the string starts with t6, which is the production of NT40. So the derivation starts with NT40, which directly produces t6.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the next symbol after t6 is t60. So, after t6 (from NT40), we have t60.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. So the entire string must be generated by the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT88 NT26, meaning S expands to two non-terminals: NT88 and NT26.\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, which are two non-terminals. Each of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet me see what NT88 and NT26 produce.\n\nLooking up NT88: NT88 -> NT8 NT32\n\nSo NT88 expands to NT8 and NT32.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> NT68 NT13.\n\nSo the entire expansion after S is NT8 NT32 and NT68 NT13.\n\nBut this seems to get complicated, so perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar, checking if it can be derived from S.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll try to see if each terminal in the string can be matched by some rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t6, t60, t52, t18, t16, t56, t15, t1, t44, t30, t34, t1, t16, t25, t20, t1, t44, t15, t49, t6, t26, t6, t30, t54, t60, t55, t44, t53, t1, t39, t32, t44, t6.\n\nEach of these terminals must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLet me check t60. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT60 doesn't exist.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. All right, so the start symbol is S, which produces NT88 NT26. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT88 can produce NT8 and NT32, and NT26 can produce NT66 and NT28. So S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 (NT8 NT32) (NT66 NT28). From there, we can expand each of these NTs further. \n\nThe string starts with t54. Let's see which NT can produce t54. Looking at the productions, NT48 \u2192 t2. But wait, t54 is directly produced by NT18. From the grammar, NT18 \u2192 t47. But no, t54 is produced when NT58 is a terminal. Wait, let me check the productions again. \n\nIn the grammar, NT48 has a production to 't2', but another production is NT58 \u2192 't28'. Also, NT54 is terminal, according to the productions. Wait no, looking back: NT48 can produce 't2' or 't56', and NT58 \u2192 't59' and 't18'... Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, let's re-examine. The NT symbols go from NT63 down to NT2, with many producing other NTs. Some directly map to terminals like 't8', 't29', etc. So, for example, NT88 \u2192 t54 t27. Wait, hold on: the grammar has NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and looking further down, NT8 is a production that can produce 't29', but also, looking at NT48, for instance, I see NT48 \u2192 't2' and also NT48 \u2192 't56'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. NT88 is first, and NT26 is second.\n\nLooking at NT88: The rules for NT88 are not explicitly given, but looking further, NT88 is an NT symbol. In other entries, NT8 appears as NT8 \u2192 t54, but NT88's production isn't directly given. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, the production S \u2192 NT88 NT26 suggests that NT88 is a non-terminal, and the same with NT26. So each of these needs to be expanded into terminals and other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for NT88, let's see the rules. From the given grammar, NT88 is produced by NT8 and NT32, right? Because looking through the rules, yes: NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 (NT8 NT32) (NT66 NT28).\n\nNow, each of these NTs needs to be broken down. Let's handle each part one by one.\n\nFirst, NT8 NT32. What do these produce?\n\nNT8: Looking at the rules, NT8 can produce t54 (look for 't54'). So NT8 \u2192 t54.\n\nNT32: Looking at the rules, NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. Then NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83, and NT75 \u2192 NT33 NT79, and so on until NT54.\n\nWait, but in the string, after the first t54, the next word is t27. So if NT32 is t27, maybe NT32 has a production that includes t27.\n\nLooking at NT32's rules: NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83, and NT83 seems to have rules leading to more NTs, but perhaps in the string, after t54 comes t27. So if we have NT32 \u2192 t27, but looking through the grammar, NT32 doesn't directly produce t27. It seems that NT32 eventually becomes more NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's look at each part of the string and see which NT could produce that.\n\nThe string starts with t54 t27. So t54 is first, possibly NT8, and t27 is produced by another NT, perhaps NT27 is a terminal. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT72 \u2192 t23, and NT90 \u2192 t56, but t27 is directly produced by NT48, because in the grammar, NT48 \u2192 't27' and also 't2'.\n\nWait, yes: NT48 can produce 't27'. So if I have NT48 t27. But in our case, after t54 comes t27. So perhaps NT?8 \u2192 t54 and the other part is another NT that produces t27.\n\nWait, let's go back. S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo after the first expansion, S \u2192 (NT8 NT32) (NT66 NT28). NT88 becomes NT8 and NT32, and NT26 becomes NT66 and NT28.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these NTs can produce.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t54 (from the grammar: NT8 \u2192 t54). So the first part is t54.\n\nThen NT32. NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So that's another non-terminal product. NT73 \u2192 NT75 NT83, then NT75 \u2192 NT33 NT79, and so on. This could continue, but perhaps at some point, it produces a terminal.\n\nLooking further, NT83 \u2192 NT55 NT18. NT55 is a non-terminal with rules (NT55 \u2192 t8? Or t58? Looking back: NT55 \u2192 t54, but no, in the grammar, NT55's productions aren't directly given as terminals. Wait, the grammar is given with rules like NT55 \u2192 't52', etc. Wait, no, the grammar's symbols for NTs can also produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, looking at the list, for example, NT55 \u2192 t54 and t52? Or another possibility.\n\nWait, the grammar is a bit lengthy. Let me search for NT55.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 t52\n- NT55 \u2192 t54\n- NT55 \u2192 t58\n\nWait, no, let me go through each line:\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 t59 and t18, t28.\n- NT55 \u2192 t52 and t54.\n\nSo NT55 can produce t52 or t54.\n\nWait, for example, NT55 has:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t52 | t54.\n\nSo if NT55 produces t54, that's acceptable. But in the string, after t54 comes t27. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, the string starts with t54, then t27. So the first part is NT8 \u2192 t54, and then the second part is something that leads to t27.\n\nWait, perhaps the first part is NT88 \u2192 something that produces t54 and then the rest of the NT32 produces t27.\n\nBut no, NT88 produces NT8 and NT32. So S \u2192 (NT8) (NT32). NT8 \u2192 t54, and NT32 \u2192 something that produces t27.\n\nWait, but NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. So how do NT73 and NT42 lead to t27?

Looking at the grammar, I see that some rules have two terminals (like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which leads to t8 and t32). Wait, but the structure might allow for the tree to be built in a way that the string can be formed by these rules.\n\nThe approach I think is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. Since it's CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or check the string against the grammar step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the top-level production. The start symbol is S, which \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, we expect the string to start with nt88 and nt26, followed by their respective expansions.\n\nBreaking down the string, the first token is t6, which must match the terminal part of one of the non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT12 NT12 \u2192 t12 t12, but doesn't match 't6'.\n- NT12 \u2192 t17, but that's a single terminal, so maybe NT70 \u2192 NT59 NT56? Wait, let's see the rules.\n\nWait, let's list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nEach production ends with a terminal or pair of terminals. For example:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, and both NT8 and NT32 derive to t8 and t32. So t8 and t32 would be the terminals from NT88.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can create a mapping of non-terminals to their terminal sequences.\n\nLet me try to make a list:\n\n- NT11 \u2192 t4\n- NT17 \u2192 t29\n- NT26 \u2192 t6\n- NT4 \u2192 t20\n- NT8 \u2192 t29\n- NT14 \u2192 t66\n- NT13 \u2192 t53\n- NT18 \u2192 t47\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT55 \u2192 t52\n- NT20 \u2192 t20 (from NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72, and both produce 't20' and 't44'; wait, no, looking at NT20's rules:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has NT20 \u2192 NT51 NT72, which then have their own expansions. So maybe that's more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to create a function that for each non-terminal, tells us what it can derive. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal either directly produces a terminal or has two non-terminals as children.\n\nI see that some non-terminals produce a single terminal, like NT33 \u2192 't1'. Others produce two terminals, like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which in turn both derive to two terminals. Wait, but in this grammar, are those non-terminals that produce two terminals only allowed to have two-terminals? Or are there non-terminals with more than one terminal?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nFor example, NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, each of which leads to 't29' and 't47' respectively. So NT48 directly produces two terminals, 't29 t47'. Similarly, NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79, which produce 't1' and 't44' (since NT33 \u2192 't1', NT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48, and NT22 \u2192 't24' maybe? Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48, and looking at NT22 and NT48:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't24' and NT48 \u2192 't29 t47'.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused because NT79 has productions that might themselves have terminal sequences. But that would mean that NT79 can produce multiple terminals, which would fit into the process.\n\nBut the key is to model each non-terminal as either a terminal (if one production leads directly to it) or as a pair of non-terminals.\n\nSo first, let's map each non-terminal to the terminals it can directly produce:\n\nNT11 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT14 \u2192 t66?\n\nWait, no, looking at NT14's rule: NT14 \u2192 NT66 NT90. Both of those expand further. NT66 \u2192 't30' and NT90 \u2192 't91', which leads to 't2' and 't33', etc. So NT14 does not directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to create for each non-terminal whether it's a terminal, or it's a pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to work backward from the string. Let's take the string and try to parse it using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t25 t30 t55 t44 t23 t23 t1 t16 t25 t39 t23 t1 t44 t30 t55 t44 t11 t1 t16 t56 t20 t45 t47 t6 t55 t44 t38 t11 t6.\n\nWe'll process the string step by step, splitting into tokens, and see if they can be matched by the grammar.\n\nStarting with the entire string, it should be generated by S \u2192 NT88 NT26, so the first part should be NT88 and the second NT26.\n\nLet's start by checking if the first two tokens can be generated by NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32.\n\nSo token1: t6. Let's see if NT8 can produce 't6'.\n\nLooking at NT8: Do any production rules for NT8 end with 't6'? Scanning through the grammar:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't1'\n- NT40 \u2192 't60'\n- NT8 \u2192 't29'\nWait, no NT8 directly produces 't6'. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's list the rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' according to the given grammar. So NT8 \u2192 t29, which would mean that the part after NT88 expanding into NT8 and NT32 would produce 't29' and whatever NT32 produces.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. Each production rule is of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So, the two-terminals case is when a rule has two terminals, like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, which would result in 't8 t32' when both NT8 and NT32 derive to a single terminal.\n\nBut wait, looking at the given grammar, the rules are:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nWhich means NT88 can only derive to a sequence of symbols, which themselves expand. So in this case, NT88 itself would produce 't8 t32' only if NT8 \u2192 t8 and NT32 \u2192 t32. But looking through the rules:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42. Both of these expand further.\n\nSo wait, maybe NT88 cannot produce a terminal string, which would make the initial assumption wrong. That can't be, because when I generated the string I considered that NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32, each leading to single terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me check every rule again.\n\nLooking for any rules that directly produce terminals (i.e., rules where A \u2192 a):\n\nFor example, NT58 \u2192 't28'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\n- NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar lines:\n\nHere are some key ones:\n\nNT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79\n\nNT33 \u2192 't1'\n\nNT79 \u2192 NT22 NT48\n\nNT22 \u2192 't24' ?? Wait, no, let's check:\n\nLooking for rules that end with a terminal.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see lines like NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87. So each rule has non-terminals on the right. Only rules where the right side has a terminal seem to be in the 'A \u2192 a' form.\n\nWait, let me parse the"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that B or C can be a terminal. However, looking at some of the rules, I notice that some terminals are on the right-hand side instead of just two non-terminals. For example, NT73 \u2192 't27' is a rule with a terminal on the right. But wait, CNF only allows productions where the right-hand side is two non-terminals. So that might mean this is not a proper CNF, but perhaps the problem states it's CNF, so maybe I missed something. Alternatively, maybe some rules have more than two symbols, but it seems like each rule has two parts, which could still be allowed in CNF, as long as both are non-terminals. Hmm, I might need to check that.\n\nLooking at the given string: t37 t16 t56 t30 t55 t44 t17 t17 t1 t16 t56 t11 t23 t23 t1 t44 t15 t1 t44 t55 t44 t23 t17 t47 t47 t60 t30 t8 t60 t55 t44 t38 t27 t26 t60.\n\nI notice that the string has 35 tokens, all terminals. So each symbol in the string must be generated by a production rule that eventually leads directly to a terminal.\n\nStarting from the start symbol, S \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nSo first, S = NT88 NT26. Let's generate the string step by step.\n\nEach \"NT\" is a non-terminal that needs to be expanded into two non-terminals, which may themselves be expanded further until we get to terminals.\n\nBut wait, the rules like NT7 \u2192 NT11 NT22 are clear. Each non-terminal can be broken down into two other non-terminals. However, some have terminals on the right side, so perhaps each rule is of the form NTX \u2192 terminal NT or NTT \u2192 NT NT.\n\nFor example, NT73 \u2192 't27'. So when we expand NT73, it directly produces 't27', which is a terminal. That would mean that 't27' is a terminal and can't be further expanded.\n\nSimilarly, rules like NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Both NT8 and NT32 can be expanded further. If we can trace back the string to see if it can be generated by these rules.\n\nWait, but the initial expansion of S is NT88 NT26.

The starting symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So, the initial productions will involve NT88 and NT26. Each of these, in turn, breaks down into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals, which are the 't' strings and numbers ending with letters like t29, t27, etc.\n\nEach NT production seems to split into two other NTs, except for some which directly produce a single terminal. For example, NT77 \u2192 NT33 NT79 and NT58 \u2192 NT33 NT4, but wait, NT4 in the given rules is a production to 't29', so NT48 could go to t27 as well since NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18, and NT2 \u2192 't28', NT18 \u2192 't8', but looking further, NT48 \u2192 't27' because it's in the replacement for NT48.\n\nWait, actually, I notice that some NTs directly map to terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't2', NT4 \u2192 't29', NT66 \u2192 't30', etc. So, the idea is that the non-terminals like NT48 can be expanded into sequences of these terminal-like symbols.\n\nThe string we're evaluating starts with t29, which comes from NT4, as per the rules. So the first two symbols in the string would need to come from a production that first produces t29 and then something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87, but also NT17 can go to 't29' if possible. Wait, no, the rules don't directly give NT17 \u2192 t29. Let me check: the given rules under NT17 are `NT17 -> NT63 NT50` and `NT17 -> NT42 NT87`. But also, looking further down, NT17 has another rule: NT17 \u2192 t29? Wait, I don't see that. No, in the given rules, under NT17, I see `NT17 -> NT63 NT50`, `NT17 -> NT42 NT87`, and another `NT17 -> t53`. Oh, right, in the NT17 section, there's `NT17 -> t53`. Oh, no, wait: let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules for NT17 are listed under the main NT17 \u2192 NT63 NT50 and NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87, but I don't see t53. Wait, in the rules provided, under NT50, maybe I'm confused. Let me look again: in the rules, I see `NT17 -> NT42 NT87` and `NT17 -> t29? Or perhaps I'm mixing up NT17 and NT40.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I spot NT17: there's a rule `NT17 -> t53` under NT53, but that's for nt53. Hmm, maybe I should look at all the rules and see where each NT can produce a terminal. \n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see NT18 produces 't47', NT11 produces 't4', NT28 to 't56', etc. But let me check the relevant ones for the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t29. So where do 't29's come from? Looking through the rules, I see NT18 \u2192 't47' (not t29), NT17 \u2192 't29' if that's a rule. Wait, I think I saw earlier that NT17 can produce t53 and t29. Let me check the NT17 rules:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT17: `NT17 -> NT63 NT50` and `NT17 -> NT42 NT87`, but I don't see any direct terminal for NT17 except in NT55 \u2192 't52', NT40 \u2192 't60', etc. Wait, do I have any NT that directly produces 't29'?\n\nLooking further, I see NT17 \u2192 't29' because in the given rules, under NT18, there's `NT18 -> 't47'`, but wait, no, let me scan each NT:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't29' (rule in the NT4 section: `NT4 -> 't29'`)\n- NT17 \u2192 't53' (under NT53) but I don't see a direct for NT17 to t29 except in the rules for the symbols. Wait, no, under NT17's rules, I don't see a direct t29. But perhaps through other productions, but that's unlikely because in parsing, it would prefer the left-most derivation, which would usually take the first possible production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in looking up. Let me carefully check each NT that produces 't29'.\n\nIn the rules, under NT4, it's `NT4 -> 't29'`. But in the NT list, is there any NT that leads to t29 through multiple steps? For example, maybe an NT that eventually goes to NT4. For instance, NT72 \u2192 NT12 NT12, and NT12 \u2192 't17', but that wouldn't produce t29.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT28 \u2192 't56', which isn't t29. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the string starts with t29, so the first terminal must come from a non-terminal that can produce it. So possible sources are NT4 \u2192 't29', and perhaps other NTs that can derive t29 through their chain.\n\nLooking through all the NTs:\n\n- NT17: under the given rules, does it have any production that leads to t29? I don't see it directly, but perhaps through another NT. Let me check:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2' (no)\n- NT28 \u2192 't56' (no)\n- NT72 \u2192 NT12 NT12 (both 't17' and 't17' perhaps?)\nWait, the string's second symbol is t27, which comes from NT48 \u2192 't27' because in the rules, NT48 \u2192 't27'.\n\nSo the string starts with t29 (from NT4?), followed by t27 (from NT48). Now, how do these connect?\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the initial step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Now, each of these NTs must produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet's try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe first symbol is t29, which should come from either NT4, NT17, etc., but likely NT4. So, let's say the first part is NT4 \u2192 't29', and the second is NT48 \u2192 't27'.\n\nBut how do NT88 and NT26 connect?\n\nWait, the overall production is S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and each of these becomes a sequence. So the string is formed by the concatenation of the expanded forms of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, after t29 and t27, the next symbol is t18.\n\nSo, the continuation after NT4 (t29) and NT48 (t27) must generate t18. Wait, in the grammar, NT18 \u2192 't47', but that's not what we need. Alternatively, maybe the productions after the initial step involve other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first NT88 and NT26 are expanding into sequences starting with t29 and t27, respectively. Let's try to see if the first part of the string can be generated by NT88 and the second part by NT26.\n\nThe first part of the string after t29 and t27 is t18, t16, t56, t30, t56, t23, t23, t57, t38, t1, t44, t30, t36, t1, t16, t56"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-657","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me start by recalling what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a context-free grammar where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any production except as the starting symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all productions except for some starting with NT and S seem to be in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT88 NT26 is correct because it's two non-terminals. Similarly, NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87 is also two non-terminals. However, I notice some exceptions. For instance, NT32 \u2192 NT73 NT42 is correct, but some others like NT17 -> NT42 NT87 and NT98 -> NT41 NT40 are in the form A\u2192BC, which is correct for CNF.\n\nWait, but looking closer, the start symbol is S, and in the string, the string starts with 't6'. The grammar has rules like NT12 \u2192 NT8 NT70, which are all CNF, except that some have terminals on the right side. For example, some productions directly go to terminals like 't27', 't8', etc. So the grammar allows for terminals on the right, which is fine because in CNF, you can have A\u2192a as a production.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t6 t60 t52 t18 t16 t56 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t23 t1 t44 t30 t34 t1 t16 t56 t20 t1 t44 t34 t30 t8 t30 t8 t6 t26 t6 t55 t44 t38 t27 t30 t52 t6`.\n\nI notice that some words in the string start with 't', which suggests they are terminals, while others might be non-terminals from the grammar. My goal is to check if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nEach 't' in the string must correspond to the terminal symbols in the grammar, which are things like 't4', 't53', etc. Wait, no\u2014the grammar actually has multiple terminals. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NT symbols produce terminals, like NT7 \u2192 't2', NT91 \u2192 't44', etc. So the string has these terminal symbols, but they must correspond to the derivations of the NT symbols.\n\nEach word in the string is a single character followed by a digit, like 't6' or 't27', except the first which is 't6' without a number? Wait, no, looking at the first word, it's 't6', which is 't' followed by 6. But in the grammar, 't's have specific codes. For example, NT50 \u2192 't4', NT58 \u2192 't18', NT18 \u2192 't47', etc.\n\nWait, let me list all the terminals from the grammar to know which 't's are allowed:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't2'\n- NT11 \u2192 't4'\n- NT17 \u2192 't29'\n- NT18 \u2192 't47'\n- NT2 \u2192 't36'\n- NT91 \u2192 't44'\n- NT75 \u2192 't60'\n- NT58 \u2192 't28'\n- NT28 \u2192 't56'\n- NT22 \u2192 't44'\n- NT55 \u2192 't52'\n- NT48 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't59' (from NT70 \u2192 't11')\nWait, actually, for example:\n\nNT70 \u2192 't11', which is 't' followed by 11. So in the string, each 't' must be part of a code like 't11', 't27', etc. So 't6' would correspond to NT12 \u2192 't12', since NT12 produces 't12'. Similarly, 't60' would correspond to 't60', but from the grammar, NT75 \u2192 't60' is incorrect. Wait, looking at the grammar, what produces 't60'? Let me check the production rules.\n\nHmm, scanning through the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't2', NT11 \u2192 't4', NT17 \u2192 't29', NT18 \u2192 't47', NT2 \u2192 't36', NT51 \u2192 't39', NT91 \u2192 't44', NT28 \u2192 't56', NT17 \u2192 't19' (as per the line NT17 \u2192 NT42 NT87, but also from NT17 \u2192 't29' no, actually NT17 appears in multiple places with different productions.

So:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t2 \n- NT11 \u2192 t4 \n- NT17 \u2192 t29, t19 \n- NT18 \u2192 t47, t18 (but NT18 is a non-terminal)\nWait, NT18 is a non-terminal, but one of its productions is 't18', meaning NT18 \u2192 't18'. Similarly, other productions for NT18 lead to other NT symbols.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nNT18 has multiple productions:\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55\n- NT18 \u2192 NT55 NT55\n- NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT47\n- NT18 \u2192 NT55 NT47\n- NT18 \u2192 NT22 NT44\n- NT18 \u2192 NT50 NT56\n- NT18 \u2192 NT30 NT33\n- NT18 \u2192 NT11 NT16\n- NT18 \u2192 NT69 NT15\n- NT18 \u2192 NT40 NT85\n\nAnd also, one production is NT18 \u2192 t18. So in the string, 't18' can be produced by NT18.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t2\n- NT2 \u2192 t36\n- NT91 \u2192 t44\n- NT28 \u2192 t56\n- NT17 \u2192 t29, t19\n- NT55 \u2192 t52\n- NT48 \u2192 t27\n- NT58 \u2192 t18 (so NT58 \u2192 t18 is a production)\n- NT70 \u2192 t11\n- NT75 \u2192 t60\n- NT7 \u2192 t59?

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and either a terminal or a non-terminal on the right. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process and makes it easier to analyze the possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the production rules are in the form of two non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals or terminals. Some rules have terminals on the right, which are the \"leaves\" of the parsing tree, meaning they correspond to terminals in the final string.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt29 t27 t18 t16 t56 t30 t56 t11 t23 t38 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t56 t11 t57 t38 t1 t44 t30 t56 t39 t32 t9 t20 t44 t47 t6 t47 t60 t55 t44 t53 t11 t60.\n\nI notice that this string consists of 41 tokens. Each token is either a 't' followed by a number or a number itself. In the grammar, many non-terminals produce these 't' tokens with numbers. For example, NT7 produces t27, NT4 produces t29, and so on. Some non-terminals produce other non-terminals which then produce more tokens.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production leads to exactly two symbols (either both non-terminals or one non-terminal and one terminal). However, in this case, I might have to look for the rightmost non-terminals that can derive into the string.\n\nI'll start by building the derivation tree from the end of the string, working backwards to see if the entire string can be generated starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, it starts with t29. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT4 produces t29. So, the last token 't29' comes from NT4. Therefore, the previous step would be something that leads to NT4.\n\nLooking at the possible rules for NT4: RT63 -> NT48 NT87 and NT4 appears in other rules. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT4 -> NT20 NT22. Wait, no, looking back, the provided grammar has NT4 -> NT20 NT22, which is correct. But 't29' comes from NT4, so how does NT4 produce 't29'? Wait, looking back, in the grammar rules, I realize that NT8 is 't29' but looking for NT4, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT4 is defined as:\n\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22\n\nWait, but I also need to see how 't29' is produced. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that NT4 is not directly producing a terminal, but wait, is there a rule that says NT48 -> t29? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, the rule NT88 -> NT83 NT32, but 't29' is not among these. Wait, in the provided grammar, I see that NT48 has some rules, for example:\n\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18\nNT48 -> NT7 -> t2?\nWait, no, looking for where NT4 leads to terminals. Let me scan the entire grammar for any rule where a non-terminal on the right side is a terminal.\n\nLooking through each rule, I see that some non-terminals directly produce txx or tx numbers. For example:\n\nNT32 -> NT73 NT42\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\nAh, here's one: NT58 -> NT33 NT4. But NT33 is another non-terminal. Wait, looking further, NT4 in the grammar: Wait, in the provided grammar, does any rule directly produce a 't'?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, I see that some non-terminals produce terminals, like:\n\nNT40 -> t6\nNT42 -> t18\nNT87 -> t27\nNT77 -> t33\nNT78. Wait, no, let's go through each rule carefully.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I notice several rules where a non-terminal on the right side is a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2' (Wait, no, looking at the rules: 't' is used with numbers, like 't27', etc.)\nWait, no, actually, the rules like NT77 -> NT33 NT79, etc., but some have terminals:\n\nFor example, NT7 -> NT59 NT58, but 't's are separate tokens.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar appears to have some rules where a non-terminal is directly producing a terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at the rule NT58 -> NT33 NT4. Wait, but 4 is not a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the grammar structure. Let me list all the production rules and see which ones produce terminals.\n\nHere are some key rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT59 NT58 \u2014 both non-terminals.\n- NT70 -> 't12' \u2014 NT70 -> t12, which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other rules like:\n\n- NT79 -> NT22 NT48\n- NT48 -> NT2 NT18\n- NT18 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't2' \u2014 wait, actually, looking back, I see that in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT59 NT58\nNT59 is undefined? No, looking back, the provided grammar has 75 production rules, some of which are simple terminals. Let me scan through each rule:\n\nI notice rule like NT48 -> NT2 NT18, which would then need to produce terminals from those non-terminals. For example, if NT2 is a terminal, that would help. Looking for which non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the 75 rules, the ones with terminals are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't2'\nWait, no, I don't see NT7 -> 't2'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misremembering because the formatting might be confusing. The user provided a huge list of production rules, each separated by a line, using \\-> to indicate production arrows.\n\nWait, in the very end of the description, towards the end, under the header 'Grammar:', the user lists the production rules with specific terminals, for example:\n\nNT58 -> NT33 NT4\nNT73 -> NT75 NT83\nNT88 -> NT8 NT32\nNT48 -> NT2 NT18\nNT7 -> NT59 NT58\nNT4 -> NT20 NT22\nNT73 -> 't27'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, okay, now this makes it clearer. So, for example, NT73 -> 't27', meaning the non-terminal NT73 produces the terminal 't27'.\n\nSo, looking through the rules, let's find all the rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal (i.e., a single terminal symbol 't' followed by a number).\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT73 -> 't27' (so NT73 produces 't27')\n- NT51 -> 't39' (so NT51 produces 't39')\n- NT94 -> 't57'\n- NT72 -> 't38', 't44', 't56', etc.\n- NT2 -> 't36'\n- NT91 -> 't44'\n- NT17 -> 't19', but I think that was part of another rule.\nWait, let me look carefully.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n1. NT73 -> 't27' \u2192 NT73 \u2192 t27\n2. NT51 -> 't39' \u2192 NT51 \u2192 t39\n3. NT94 -> 't57' \u2192 NT94 \u2192 t57\n4. NT72 -> 't38', yes, in the rule NT72 -> 't32', etc. Wait, looking again: NT72 appears in several rules, but one of them is NT72 -> 't38'.\n5. NT91 -> 't44' \u2192 NT91 \u2192 t44\n6.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF has all production rules in the form of A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can be on the right-hand side if another non-terminal is present. But when terminals are involved, each production can have at most one terminal. So I think this grammar might have some rules that have terminals on the right-hand side, but since CNF typically only has non-terminals on the right, maybe some steps involve introducing a terminal and then another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that there are many production rules with 't' followed by a number, like 't27', 't18', etc. From the context, these are terminal symbols, while the rest are non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which initially produces NT88 and NT26.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of these terminal symbols. So I'll start by trying to derive the string step by step by breaking down the string into components that match the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the string as a list: t6, t27, t18, t16, t56, t30, t44, t16, t25, t20, t1, t44, t15, t1, t44, t30, t55, t44, t17, g17, t1, t16, t25, t39, t32, t9, t20, t44, t26, t6, t47, t60, t55, t44, t53, t27, t26, t60.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT88 NT26, the first step is to see if the string can be broken down into two parts that match the left-hand sides of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me look at NT88 and NT26 in the grammar:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n- NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nSo the initial production for S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT88 NT26 \u2192 NT8 NT32 NT68 NT13\n\nNow, the string starts with t6, t27, t18, etc. But according to the grammar, the initial production goes to NT88 and NT26, so the string should be a combination of the expansions of NT88 and NT26.\n\nLet me see what each of these non-terminals can produce. Starting with NT88:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNT8 is a non-terminal, and looking at the rules, NT8 \u2192 't29' \u2192 so NT8 produces 't29' as a terminal. Wait, but looking back, the rule NT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32. Then NT8 \u2192 't29'? But in the given string, I don't see 't29' at all. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.\n\nWait, let me check the rules. The NT8 rule isn't directly given, but looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT8 is referenced in many places. Looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT8. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the list again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT8 isn't directly a production. Wait, maybe I should look for where NT8 appears on the left-hand side. Let me scan through.\n\nAh, I see:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT20 NT22\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' is not directly present, but looking for NT8, perhaps it's produced by other rules. Wait, perhaps it's produced by a rule not listed, which might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe 't29' is only in certain rules.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see NT48 \u2192 't2' 't18' (t2 and t18 are terminals). NT4 also \u2192 't20' 't22'.\n\nWait, maybe I've misinterpreted something. Let's make sure.\n\nWait, the given grammar has a set of rules where each rule is on a separate line. Some have non-terminals, others have a mix of terminals and non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT8 NT32\n\nNT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18\n\nBut in the rule list, some have only non-terminals. For example:\n\nNT8\u2192 't29' appears in multiple places, but in this specific grammar, maybe I should check if NT8 can produce a terminal.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the rules, I see that NT13 is connected to t30, but not NT8.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT8 in the rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't29', but wait, do I see any rule where NT8 is on the left?\n\nYes, in several places:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't52', 't54'\n- NT58 \u2192 't28', 't56'\n- NT73 \u2192 't30', 't55'\n- NT89 \u2192 't41', 't50' [Wait, no, 't41' is under NT91]\n- NT18 \u2192 't47', 't54'\n- NT12 \u2192 ...[Hmm, not applicable here]\n- NT94 \u2192 't57', 't59'\n- NT59 \u2192 't54', 't14'\n- NT76 \u2192 't55', 't50'\n- NT16 \u2192 't9', 't47'\n- NT12 \u2192 't23', 't23'? Wait, no, looking back, NT12 is:\n- NT72 \u2192 't44', 't33' [Wait, not applicable]\n- NT7 \u2192 ...[Not relevant]\n- NT11 \u2192 't4', 't30'\n\nWait, but I don't see any NT8 rule that ends with 't29' except in multiple places, but looking again, perhaps I've made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I notice that:\n\nNT8 \u2192 't29' is written multiple times, but in the line NT11 \u2192 't4', 't30', that's different. Wait, perhaps I need to check each line more carefully.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking through all the rules, I don't see a rule for NT8 on the left, but maybe it's produced by another rule. Wait, perhaps it's part of a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and I need to proceed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production S \u2192 NT88 NT26, and each of these can be expanded further. Let me try to derive the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial step is S \u2192 NT88 NT26. So the string must be a combination of the expansion of NT88 and NT26. So the first part of the string is generated by NT88 and the second by NT26.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t6. So let's see if t6 can be the first part of NT26 or NT88.\n\nWait, let's look at the possible expansion of NT26:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13\n\nNT68 \u2192 NT54 NT28\n\nNT13 \u2192 NT7 NT69\n\nBut looking further down, when NT13 \u2192 't30' (in NT73's case, but perhaps I need to see if NT13 can produce 't30' directly? Or via other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me approach this methodically.\n\nThe string starts with t6, so perhaps the first part is generated by NT26, which starts with NT68 NT13.

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. Also, the start symbol isn't nullable. In this case, the start symbol is S.\n\nThe given grammar has a bunch of non-terminals and terminals (some 't' followed by numbers). My goal is to check if the string can be derived from S using these rules.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a derivation path. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step should produce exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc.), so each production should reduce the string's length by one step.\n\nLet's see, the string starts with t54 and ends with t60. I need to see if these are terminals that match the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules have terminals on the right. For example, NT7 -> NT11 NT22 leads to t2 because NT11 -> 't4' and NT22 -> 't2' from their productions. Wait, no, let me check the given rules.\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\nNT7 -> NT11 NT22 leads to 't4' and 't2', but where do they go? Let me see the options.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT7 is split into NT11 and NT22. And NT11 has a production to 't4' (NT11 -> 't4') and NT22 is 't2' (from NT22 -> 't26'? Wait, no, looking through, I see:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, the rule NT11 is defined as 't4', so NT11 -> 't4' directly. Similarly, NT22 has a production NT22 -> 't26' according to one of the rules. Wait, yes:\n\nLooking through, for NT22: I see NT22 -> 't26'.\n\nWait, let me list out the rules that have 't's:\n\n- NT7 -> NT11 NT22 (so this leads to 't4' 't26')\n- NT17 -> NT63 NT58 (NT63 is NT48, which goes to NT87 and NT18, which lead to t29 and t47, so 't29 t47'? Wait, no, let's be careful.)\n\nWait, maybe I should create a mapping of all the terminals to their output. Let me go through each rule:\n\n1. NT7 -> NT11 NT22 \u2192 't4' 't26'\n2. NT88 is only on the right side, but in the string, I don't see it, so maybe it's never used yet.\n3. NT48 is on the left in some rules, like NT48 -> NT2 NT18, which goes to 't36' and something. Wait, let's parse it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting from S and breaking down the string step by step. The start symbol is S, which is NT63 NT26.\n\nSo S = NT63 NT26.\n\nLet's try expanding NT63 and NT26.\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87 (from NT63's rule)\nNT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13 (from NT26's rule)\n\nSo S expands to NT48 NT87 NT68 NT13.\n\nNow, the string we're trying to match is: `t54 t27 t18 ...` etc.\n\nSo let's match the first part.\n\nThe first symbol is t54. Let's see which production results in 't54'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT28 \u2192 't56' (from NT56 is not directly a terminal, but NT28 \u2192 't56' in NT58's rule: wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the rules include:\n\nLooking for a rule that starts with a non-terminal and leads directly to t54. Scanning through:\n\n- NT40 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't18'\n- NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 \u2192 't36' 'something'\n- NT54 \u2192 NT13 NT55? Wait, looking for t54.\n\nWait, maybe looking for a production that leads to t54.\n\nWait, I don't immediately see a rule that produces t54. Let's check each production:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't44'\n- NT36 \u2192 't1'\n- NT55 \u2192 't52', 't54', 't52'\n\nWait, looking for NT55:\n\n- NT55 appears in several rules:\n  - NT55 \u2192 NT52 NT4 (which would be t52 and whatever NT4 is)\n  - NT55 \u2192 NT54 NT2 (which would be t54 and whatever NT2 is)\n  - NT55 \u2192 NT52 NT4 (again)\n\nWait, but we're looking for t54. So perhaps NT55 \u2192 NT54 NT2, which would mean 't54' followed by whatever NT2 is.\n\nBut NT2 is part of NT22, which leads to 't26'. Or does NT2 have a rule? Let's check:\n\nLooking through, NT2 has the rule: NT2 \u2192 NT87 NT70 \u2192 't29' 't11'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps t54 comes from a different production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire string and see if I can find a path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parsing starts with S, which is NT63 and NT26, both non-terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with t54, which is a terminal. Therefore, we need to find a production of some non-terminal that leads to t54.\n\nLooking back, do any rules produce t54?\n\nLooking through each production, I see NT36 \u2192 't1', NT55 \u2192 't54' in the production NT55 \u2192 NT54 NT2.\n\nAh, so if NT55 can produce 't54' followed by whatever NT2 is, which is 't29' and 't11'.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t54, so maybe we have a path:\n\nNT55 \u2192 t54 followed by NT2, which is 't29'.\n\nBut if that's the case, the next symbol after t54 would need to be t29. However, looking at the string, the second symbol is t27. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've chosen the wrong production.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion is different. Let's reconsider.\n\nAnother approach: the initial S is NT63 NT26, so the first two symbols should be the productions of NT63 and NT26.\n\nSo NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87, which would produce two non-terminals; similarly, NT26 \u2192 NT68 NT13.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is a terminal, t54. So this approach might not work unless NT48 or NT87 have a production that starts with a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion of NT63 or NT26 could involve further expansions that eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I need to step through it more carefully.\n\nStarting with S: NT63 NT26.\n\nThe first symbol must be a terminal, so perhaps both NT63 and NT26 have to produce terminals. So let's see what's possible.\n\nLooking at NT63 \u2192 NT48 NT87. So NT48 produces 't36' and 'something' (from NT2 and NT18).\n\nWait, NT48 is a non-terminal. Let's see NT48's production: NT48 \u2192 NT2 NT18 \u2192 't36' and 'something'.\n\nWait, NT18 \u2192 NT66 NT55. Then NT66 \u2192 NT30 NT55 and NT55 \u2192 't54'.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-682","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, but it's a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal on the left-hand side (LHS) expands into two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS). All terminals are on the RHS, which is helpful because it means the production rules are straightforward and can be used in a way that each production step adds exactly one terminal or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's quite extensive. There are many non-terminals, and each has exactly two productions\u2014except the ones defined as 't's, which I assume are terminals because they don't have any arrows. So, the 't's are the actual symbols that appear in the generated string, while the other parts are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t16 t25 t15 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t56 t23 t17 t57 t38 t1 t44 t15 t1 t44 t55 t44 t11 t47 t26 t60 t30 t52 t6 t26 t6 t55 t44 t38 t1 t11 t23 t38 t44 t60.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the expansion process to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S. Since this is a large string, it's going to involve several production steps, but I can approach it methodically.\n\nBreaking it down, the start symbol is S, which according to the grammar produces NT88 NT26. So, the string starts with S -> NT88 NT26, meaning the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT88 followed by the expansion of NT26.\n\nLooking at NT88, in the grammar it's defined as -> NT8 NT32. So, NT88 is replaced by NT8 and NT32. Now, NT8 is another non-terminal. Looking at NT8's productions, in the grammar, it's defined as -> NT54 NT16. So, NT8 becomes NT54 and NT16.\n\nSimilarly, NT32 is defined as -> NT73 NT42. So, NT32 becomes NT73 and NT42.\n\nNow, let's look at NT54. Its production is in the grammar as -> NT56 NT28. Hmm, wait, I think I might have mixed up NT54 and NT56. Let me check again. Wait, in the grammar, NT54 is defined as -> NT56 NT28.\n\nWait, but in the 't's, I have t56 appearing multiple times. Let me track each part as I go.\n\nStarting with S: NT88 -> NT8 NT32\nThen NT8 -> NT54 NT16\nThen NT54 -> NT56 NT28\nAnd NT16 -> NT20 NT04\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, NT16 isn't defined. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT54 is -> NT56 NT28, as per the first glance. Or is it? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT56 is a symbol, but I see that NT55 and NT54 are present. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify all the non-terminals and their productions. Alternatively, let's approach each part step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's getting too complicated, and instead, I should use a bottom-up approach or look for a way to parse the string using the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check the end of the string and see if it corresponds to any non-terminal's RHS.\n\nLooking at the string, the last few elements are t60. So, I can backtrack to see what produces t60. Looking at the grammar, I see that several non-terminals expand into terminal 't's, but let's check for t60.\n\nIn the grammar, NT60 is not present; perhaps, looking for 't60' in the RHS of any production rule. Wait, in the productions, I don't see 't60' as a terminal. Wait, no\u2014actually, looking through the productions, some 't's are defined as the terminal symbols. Wait no, I think in this grammar, all non-terminals on the left side are replaced by two other non-terminals, which are either terminals or other non-terminals, but in the production rules, the non-terminals on the LHS do not have any terminals except for those explicitly defined.\n\nWait, perhaps this is where I'm getting confused. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either a non-terminal to two non-terminals or a single terminal. But in this case, all the productions on the RHS are non-terminals except for those that end up being terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking again, in the grammar, all the RHS are non-terminals except for those that have 't' symbols, like 't37', 't44', etc. So, for example, NT58 -> 't' + something. So, looking at the productions, some of them have 't's. For example, NT11 -> 't4', NT7 -> 't2', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is t60. So, I need a production that leads to t60. Looking through the productions, I realize that none of the non-terminals directly produce t60. So that's a problem because it suggests that the string might not be possible unless t60 is a terminal, but in the grammar, there's no production for a non-terminal that expands to t60 as a single terminal, except perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier\u2014the productions for NT70, for example, are -> NT12 NT12, and NT12 -> NT55 NT18, and so on. But according to the given productions, I don't see any non-terminal expanding into t60 directly. Therefore, perhaps t60 is a terminal, but for that, it must be defined in a production rule on the RHS of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the provided productions, none of the RHSs are 't60'. So, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the last symbol is t60, which is not produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the grammar. The productions include, for example, NT40 -> 't6', but t60 isn't present.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar to identify the start symbol and the terminal symbols. The start symbol is S because it's the topmost non-terminal. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers except for a few that directly produce 't' followed by numbers. So the terminals are like 't37', 't16', etc.\n\nThe given string consists entirely of these terminal symbols. My task is to see if there's a derivation path from S that can produce this string through the productions in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of derivation replaces a single non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. In CNF, the length of the string directly corresponds to the number of steps in the derivation. For example, if a string is of length 2, it takes one production, length 3 requires two steps, and so on. So the number of symbols in the string after expansion should be equal to 2^n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens in the string. The string is: t37 t16 t56 t15 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t30 t44 t19 ... Wait, actually, the string starts with t37 and ends with t45. Wait, the exact string is: \n\n`t37 t16 t56 t15 t1 t44 t30 t44 t16 t25 t39 t30 t44 t19 t27 t30 t54 t6 t30 t54 t60 t30 t54 t6 t55 t44 t38 t27 t47 t60`.\n\nLet me count the number of tokens here. \n\nBreaking it down: \n1. t37\n2. t16\n3. t56\n4. t15\n5. t1\n6. t44\n7. t30\n8. t44\n9. t16\n10. t25\n11. t39\n12. t30\n13. t44\n14. t19\n15. t27\n16. t30\n17. t54\n18. t6\n19. t30\n20. t54\n21. t60\n22. t30\n23. t54\n24. t6\n25. t55\n26. t44\n27. t38\n28. t27\n29. t47\n30. t60.\n\nSo the string has 30 tokens. Since each production in CNF leads to exactly two non-terminals, the length of the string is 2^n, where n is the number of productions. But 30 is not a power of 2. The powers of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. 30 is between 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). Therefore, it's impossible for the string length to be 30 because each step doubles the number of symbols. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I should make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me check the initial derivation steps.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT88 NT26. Each of these can split into other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT88 could produce something like NT88 \u2192 ... Let's see some productions:\n\nLooking back, for NT88, the production is NT88 \u2192 NT83 NT1. Then NT83 \u2192 NT68 NT35, and so on. It's a bit complex, but each step would double the count until terminals are produced.\n\nBut the key point is that the number of tokens must be a power of two. Since 30 isn't, it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 30 tokens, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each derivation step doubles the number of symbols until terminals are reached. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is either a single non-terminal symbol, or two non-terminals. However, the grammar provided here seems to mix both single and two-symbol productions, so maybe I should check if it's properly in CNF.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see some have three symbols on the right side, like `NT7 -> NT11 NT22 NT22` which breaks the CNF rule because CNF requires each production to have exactly one or two non-terminals. Hmm, that suggests the grammar might not be in proper CNF, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. The question says it's presented in CNF, so maybe I should proceed under that assumption, perhaps there's a typo or something.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending in 't', which must result from the terminals in the grammar. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar, term by term.\n\nI'll start by listing the productions that produce terminals.
