Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which means the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. So the string generated by S should be a combination of the strings generated by NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6, I see it can produce several options. Let me list them:\n\nNT6 can be:\n- NT27 NT19\n- NT33 NT19\n- NT21 NT25\n\nHmm. Each of these splits NT6 into two other non-terminals. I should check if these non-terminals can eventually produce 't28'.\n\nLet's take each path one by one.\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n   So, I need to see what NT27 and NT19 can produce.\n   NT19 can produce 't47' according to the rules, so that's fixed.\n   Now, NT27 can produce:\n   - NT7 NT7\n   - NT12 NT18\n   - NT22 NT0\n\n   Let's pick each option for NT27 and see.\n\n   a. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n      Both NT7s produce 't66' or 't73' according to the rules.\n      So the string from this path would be a combination of two 't66's or two 't73's, but we need 't28'. So this path doesn't lead to 't28'.\n\n   b. NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n      NT12 can produce NT14 NT0 and NT22 NT0.\n\n      Let's take NT12 \u2192 NT14 NT0:\n         NT14 produces 't72' or 't66' ... no, we need something else. NT14 can also be NT27 NT19, but that might not help. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\n      NT18 can produce NT17 NT10 or NT10 NT11.\n\n      Wait, looking back, NT18 options are:\n      - NT17 NT10\n      - NT10 NT11\n      - NT22 NT0 (Wait, no, looking at the list, NT18 is only two options: NT17 NT10 and NT10 NT11).\n\n      Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try another path.\n\n   c. NT27 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n      NT22 can produce NT6 NT15 or NT10 NT21.\n      NT0 always produces 't66'.\n\n      Let me take NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT15 first.\n         NT6 can then produce options as above, but this is getting too nested. Maybe this path isn't leading to 't28'.\n\n      Alternatively, take NT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21:\n         NT10 \u2192 't12' or 't84' (But looking back, the rules for NT10 are: it can produce NT14 NT31 or NT31 NT7. Wait, according to the provided grammar, NT10's production is: NT10 \u2192 't12' or 't84'? Wait no, I might be mixing up the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me list all production rules more clearly.\n\nLooking at NT10 in the grammar:\nNT10 \u2192 't12' or 't84'?\n\nWait, the rules provided are:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31\nNT10 \u2192 NT31 NT7\nBut looking back, I see:\n\nWait, no, let me check again.\n\nThe provided rules include:\n\nNT10 -> NT14 NT31\nNT10 -> NT31 NT7\nOh, right. So NT10 can produce:\n- NT14 NT31\n- NT31 NT7\n\nBut in the string we're trying to get is 't28', so let's see what these produce.\n\nNT14 can produce 't72' (from the rules NT14 \u2192 't72'), so NT14 would be 't72'.\n\nThen, NT31 can produce several things, like NT35, etc., but looking back, some NT31 rules produce things that lead to 't66' or 't73', etc. But where does 't28' come in?\n\nWait, maybe I should check each non-terminal's production rules to see what strings they can produce.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the derivation of 't28'.\n\nLet me consider where 't28' can come from. Looking through the production rules, which non-terminals produce 't28'? Let's check each production.\n\nLooking at NT22: it can produce NT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21 or NT10 NT21.\n\nWait, looking at NT22's rules: I see NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT15, NT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21, and other options.\n\nWait, in the list, NT22 has multiple rules, but looking back, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT15\nNT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (Wait, no, I think I might have misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for NT22, the rules are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT15\nWait, no: According to the provided grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n- NT22 \u2192 NT10 NT21\n- NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT15\n- NT22 \u2192 NT10 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT24 NT14\n- NT22 \u2192 NT14 NT25\n- NT22 \u2192 NT24 NT19\n- NT22 \u2192 NT20 NT15\n\nHmm, but I'm more interested in whether 't28' can be produced by any of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps NT31 can produce 't28'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT31 is defined as:\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT25\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT20\nNT31 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nWait, none of these directly produce a terminal, except when they split into other non-terminals. For example, NT27 can split into NT12 and NT18, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can directly produce 't28'. Looking through the rules, NT2 can produce 't28' according to the list:\n\nYes, NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT2, one of the productions is:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nSo NT2 can directly produce 't28'. That's a terminal symbol.\n\nBut wait, where does NT2 come from in the initial S?\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\n\nSo S produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. So any string from S must be a combination of strings from NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut 't28' is just a single terminal symbol, not a combination. That suggests that 't28' cannot directly be generated from S, because S requires two non-terminals to produce a string.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT6 NT34, then the generated string must be the concatenation of the strings produced by NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut 't28' is a single symbol. That would require that the entire string is just 't28', which can only happen if NT6 produces 't28' and NT34 produces an empty string, which isn't the case because the grammar starts with S on the left and production rules on the right, not including epsilon.\n\nWait, looking back, none of the non-terminals have epsilon productions. All productions are in the form of A \u2192 B C, A \u2192 a, etc. So all generated strings must have at least two symbols, unless a non-terminal A can produce \u03b5. But looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that produce \u03b5.\n\nWait, looking again, I don't see any production that produces \u03b5. So the minimal string from S would be two terminals or more, unless there's a path that produces a single terminal, which is impossible because the initial productions require two non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

{"custom_id":"request-4","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string \"t14\" is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's start by trying to understand how this grammar works and see if \"t14\" can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar's production rules. The start symbol is S, which directly expands into NT6 NT34, so S -> NT6 NT34. So, each step of derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals, and eventually, all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nThe string we're trying to match is \"t14\". So, I need to see if starting from S, after a series of replacements, I end up with just \"t14\".\n\nLet me see if there's a production rule that directly produces \"t14\". Looking through the rules... Wait, I see NT15 -> 't65' and NT18 -> 't22', but not NT14. Let me check again. NT14 -> NT2 NT1, and NT1 is NT14 NT28, and NT28 -> NT20 NT11, which in turn goes to NT12 NT18 and NT11. This seems a bit recursive and a bit confusing. Maybe there's a rule that produces \"t14\" directly.\n\nLooking through all the rules again, I see NT6 -> 't20' and NT2 -> 't28', but not directly NT14. Oh, wait! There's a rule NT1 -> 't61', NT14 -> NT2 NT1, so NT14 would expand into NT2 NT1. If NT2 is replaced by 't28' and NT1 by 't61', that would give 't28t61', which isn't \"t14\". Hmm, maybe that's not the path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look for any non-terminal that expands to \"t14\". Scanning through the rules, I don't immediately see any. The closest is NT15 -> 't65', NT18 -> 't22', NT22 -> 't77' or others, but none lead to \"t14\". So maybe \"t14\" is not directly generated by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"t14\" can be reached through a series of expansions from S. Let's see: S starts as NT6 NT34. Let's replace NT6 and NT34 with their respective expansions.\n\nFrom the rules, NT6 has multiple productions. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 -> NT27 NT19 and NT6 -> NT33 NT19, and also NT6 -> NT21 NT25 and others. Let's pick one, say NT6 -> 't20' and NT34 -> 't3'. Wait, so S expands to NT6 NT34, which would be 't20' and 't3', making the string \"t20t3\". But that's not \"t14\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a different path. Let's consider NT6 -> NT27 NT19, which would be two more non-terminals. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT27 has rules: NT27 -> NT7 NT7, NT27 -> 't66', and others like 't73'. Wait, so NT27 can be replaced as 't66' directly. So if NT27 is 't66', then NT19 is either 't47' or... Let me check NT19 rules. NT19 -> 't47' and also NT19 -> 't72', right? Because looking at the rules, I see NT19 -> 't47' and NT19 -> 't72'. So, if NT19 is 't47', then NT27 is 't66', making NT6 as 't66t47'. So the part from S's expansion would be 't66t47' followed by NT34 -> 't3', so the entire string becomes 't66t47t3', which is longer than \"t14\". Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, if NT19 is 't72', then S would expand to 't66t72t3', which is even longer and still not \"t14\".\n\nHmm, perhaps another path. Let's consider that NT6 could also be 't21'. Wait, yes, NT6 -> 't21' as well, isn't it? Let me check. Looking at the rules: Yes, NT6 -> 't21' and 't25' and others. So, if in the S expansion we choose NT6 -> 't21', that would be one part, and NT34 -> 't3', so together it's 't21t3', which is \"t21t3\", not \"t14\".\n\nBut maybe we can get a single 't14' through some other non-terminal's expansion. Wait, does any non-terminal produce just 't14'? Looking through all the rules, none seem to. Let me double-check each non-terminal:\n\n- NT6: sometimes 't20', 't21', 't25', 't27' depending on the production.\n- NT1: 't61'\n- NT14: NT2 NT1\n  NT2: 't28'\n  So NT14 would produce 't28t61'\n- NT2: 't28' or 't37' in some cases\n- NT6: 't66'\nWait, looking for 't14'... Hmm, unless a non-terminal can directly produce 't14', which seems not.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing a rule where a non-terminal directly goes to 't14'. Let me scan all the rules again. NT10->'t12', NT11->'t11', NT15->'t65', NT14->'t2something', etc. No, nothing directly produces 't14'. So is \"t14\" possible at all?\n\nWait another approach: perhaps \"t14\" can be derived from NT15. Let's see. NT15 -> 't65', so that's a terminal. NT15 also expands into NT7 NT4. Let's see what those produce.\n\nNT7 -> 't66' or 't73', and NT4 -> 't29' or others. But 't66' and 't29' would make something like 't66t29' or 't73t29', not 't14'.\n\nWait, maybe through another non-terminal. For example, NT24->'t14'. Oh, right! NT24 has a production rule: NT24 -> 't14'. Ah, finally! So if NT24 expands to 't14', then if we can derive NT24, then \"t14\" is produced.\n\nSo, how can we get to NT24? Let me see. NT24 has only one production rule: NT24 -> 't14'. So that's it. So to generate 't14', we need to have a derivation path that ends with NT24.\n\nSo, let's see if S can eventually produce NT24 and then expand it to 't14'.\n\nLooking at the initial expansion of S: S->NT6 NT34.\n\nLet me see if NT6 can be expanded in a way that leads to NT24 in the chain. Let's trace possible expansions.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules: it can expand into NT27 NT19, which might lead further down.\n\nWait, if I can get into a path where NT24 is a leaf node, then perhaps I can get 't14'. Let me try to find a derivation chain.\n\nStarting with S: NT6 NT34.\n\nLet's take NT6->NT27 NT19. So now, S expands to NT27 NT19 NT34.\n\nNow, expand each non-terminal step by step. Start with the leftmost non-terminal that can expand further.\n\nNT27: possible productions include NT7 NT7, 't66', 't73'. Let's pick 't66' first.\n\nSo now we have 't66' NT19 NT34.\n\nNext, expand NT19: possible rules are 't47' and 't72'. Let's take 't47' first.\n\nSo now, 't66' 't47' NT34.\n\nNow, expand NT34: rule is 't3'. So 't66t47t3'.\n\nWait, but that's a string of length 3, not a single 't14'. So that doesn't help. Let's try another path.\n\nBack to NT19: instead of 't47', choose 't72'. So now, it's 't66' 't7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where each non-terminal can produce two terminals or two non-terminals. The given grammar seems to fit this structure. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's defined as S -> NT6 NT34. So, the string must start with what NT6 and NT34 can derive.\n\nNow, let me look at NT6 and NT34. I see that NT6 has multiple productions, for example, NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> 't20'. Similarly, NT34 -> 't3'. So, S starts as 't20 t3' if NT6 and NT34 take their terminal forms directly, but I don't think that's the case because the string is 't10 t57', which doesn't match 't20 t3'.\n\nWait, but maybe NT6 and NT34 can expand further. Let me check NT6's productions. NT6 -> NT27 NT19 is one option, and it also has other non-terminal options. Let me see NT27 and NT19.\n\nLooking at NT27, it can produce 't72' or NT7 NT7. Hmm. NT7 has two options: 't66', 't73'. So, if NT27 is 't72', that could help, but if it's NT7 NT7, then each NT7 could produce either 't66' or 't73', so that could result in t66 t66, t66 t73, or t73 t73. But I need t10 and t57. So perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nWait, let me also check NT34. NT34 can produce 't3' directly, but can it expand? Looking at the grammar, NT34's productions only seem to have one terminal: NT34 -> 't3'. So it can't expand further; it's a terminal. So, S as a whole would start with whatever NT6 and NT34 produce. Since S -> NT6 NT34, and NT34 -> t3, then S can only start with something ending in t3, but our string starts with t10. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Maybe S can generate t10 and t57 through some other expansion paths of NT6 and NT34. Let me not assume what NT6 can produce yet.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by looking at the string 't10 t57' and see if both tokens can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLet me check each token:\n\n- t10: Is there any production that directly gives t10? Looking through the grammar rules, I see that many non-terminals have productions leading to t tokens. For example, NT10 -> 't12', NT1 -> 't61', etc. Wait, let's see all the rules where a non-terminal produces 't10'. I see here: NT12 -> NT1 NT34, but I don't see a direct production for 't10'. Wait, looking through the list, I don't see any production that directly produces 't10' except perhaps some non-terminals that eventually derive to it.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. NT10 has a production that goes to t12, t1, t77, etc. Wait, looking back, I see NT10 -> 't12', NT10 -> 't14', NT10 -> 't84', and so on. But nowhere do I see a production for 't10' directly or through a chain. Let me check.\n\nLooking at NT10: NT10 -> 't12', 't14', 't84', 't66', 't12' again, 't29', 't40', etc. So no, NT10 doesn't have a production that leads to 't10'.

Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT10's productions:\n\nNT10 -> NT12\nNT10 -> NT14\nNT10 -> NT84\nNT10 -> NT66\nNT10 -> NT29\nNT10 -> 't12'\nNT10 -> 't14'\nNT10 -> 't84'\nNT10 -> 't66'\nNT10 -> 't29'\nNT10 -> 't40'\nNT10 -> 't83'\nNT10 -> 't12' again.\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting. So, in the grammar, every production of NT10 seems to go to other non-terminals or some terminals, but none of them are directly 't10'. So, I can't generate 't10' through any path in this grammar because there's no rule that produces 't10' directly or through a series of non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait a minute. Let me check all the rules again very carefully.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, here are all the rules for NT10:\n\n- NT10 -> NT12\n- NT10 -> NT14\n- NT10 -> NT84\n- NT10 -> NT66\n- NT10 -> NT29\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't84'\n- NT10 -> 't66'\n- NT10 -> 't29'\n- NT10 -> 't40'\n- NT10 -> 't83'\n- NT10 -> 't12' (again)\n\nSo, there is no 't10' production in the grammar. All the terminals are like 't12', 't14', etc., but not 't10'. Therefore, the string 't10 t57' can't be produced because 't10' is not present in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that can produce 't10'. Perhaps a deeper expansion.\n\nBut considering the structure, every time a non-terminal expands, it either goes to two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for 't10' to be a terminal, there must be a production rule where a non-terminal directly maps to t10. But looking through all the rules, I don't see such a rule. So, it's impossible for 't10' to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check all the rules again. Hmm, perhaps the NT6 or NT34 can somehow lead to 't10'?\n\nWait, S starts with NT6 and NT34. NT6 can produce several things. For example, it can produce t20 directly. It can also produce NT27 NT19, among other things. NT34 produces t3 directly.\n\nSo, if S is to produce a string starting with 't10', that would require that the first symbol in S's expansion is 't10', but S is based on NT6 which can't produce 't10', as we established. Alternatively, maybe the expansions of NT6 and NT34 could lead to 't10' somehow.\n\nBut no, because even if NT6 and NT34 produce other non-terminals, each step only produces terminals or pairs of non-terminals. So, to get 't10' in the string, it would have to come from a production that can reach it. But since no rule can reach 't10', it's impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere. Let me think about the possible expansion paths. Maybe some NT0 can produce t0, but that's a different token. Our string is 't10 t57', so 't10' and 't57'. Since the grammar can't produce 't10' at all, regardless of other parts, the entire string can't be generated.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string 't10 t57' is not generated by the given grammar because there's no production that can derive 't10', and thus it's impossible for the string to appear.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string \"t68 t14\" can be generated by this grammar. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar rules to see how strings are formed. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34. So the entire string must be derived from S, which means the string is two tokens long: NT6 and NT34. Wait, but the given string is \"t68 t14\", which is two tokens as well, \"t68\" and \"t14\". So maybe I can break this down.\n\nLooking at the rules, each NT has production rules. Let's see:\n\n- NT6 can go to NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or other rules, but in the end, some of these rules end up producing 't' tokens with numbers. For example, NT6 eventually can become t20, t80, etc. But in the string, we have t68 and t14. So, I need to see how NT6 and NT34 can produce these.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT1 -> t61\nNT6 -> t20\nNT6 -> t80\nWait, maybe I should focus on the specific NTs in the string. The string starts with NT6 and ends with NT34. So, I need to find a path from NT6 to t68 and from NT34 to t14.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT34's rules:\nNT34 -> NT31 NT17\nNT34 -> NT15 -> t65\nNT34 -> NT22 -> t77\nNT34 -> NT24 -> t14\nSo, NT34 can produce t24->t14. So that's a match for t14 in the string.\n\nNow, for NT6, let's see how it can produce t68. Looking at NT6's rules:\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nBut NT25 has two rules: t49 and t57. Hmm, not t68. Alternatively, NT6 can go to NT17 NT7. NT17 can become t54, and NT7 can become t73 or t66. Not matching t68.\n\nWait, are there any other rules for NT6? Oh, wait, in the initial rules, it also goes to NT1 which becomes t61, but not t68.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 can go to NT27 NT19. Let's see what NT27 does. NT27 -> NT7 NT7, which can become t66 or t73. Hmm, maybe that's not it.\n\nWait, is there a rule for NT6 that I'm missing? Let me check the rules again.\n\nOh, looking back, I see NT6's rules include:\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19 and NT6 -> NT27 NT19. Let me see NT33: NT33 -> NT31 NT17. NT31 can end up as t43 or others, but NT17 is t54. Not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production path. Let me try a different approach. Maybe there's a way for NT6 to derive t68 directly. Looking at the tokens, if NT6 can end with t68, that would require some specific production. Checking the NT6 rules, none seem to directly produce t68. So perhaps NT6 can't produce t68, which would mean the string can't be generated.\n\nBut wait, maybe I oversaw something. Let me check the NT6 rules again. No, I don't see any rule that directly or indirectly leads to t68 from NT6. So if the string starts with t68, which would have to come from NT6, but it can't, that would make the string invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe the NT6 is connected to another NT that can produce t68. Hmm, no, because NT6's rules all produce combinations of NTs that don't lead to t68.\n\nSo, putting it together: NT34 can produce t14, which matches the second part, but NT6 cannot produce t68, so the string \"t68 t14\" can't be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-46","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the string `t39 t11 t55` can be generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), every production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because all the productions are either generating two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe input string is three terminals: `t39`, `t11`, `t55`. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string must be a leftmost derivation sequence. So, I need to see if S can produce this sequence.\n\nStarting with S, which according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S needs to be split into NT6 and NT34. Let's process each of these separately.\n\nStarting with NT6:\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions. The relevant one here is probably NT6 \u2192 t39. Wait, let me check the rules for NT6.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t80 is another option. Wait, but also NT6 \u2192 t52 (from NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT31, which maybe isn't directly helpful). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all NT6 productions.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT6 appears in several productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT... No, wait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the production that directly outputs a terminal for NT6. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 t80, NT6 \u2192 t52 (from NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT31 which ends up as t54?), and NT6 \u2192 t66 (from NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, which maybe is t49 + t57?), but I don't see NT6 directly producing t20 or t52. Wait, let me check each NT6 rule carefully.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT6, the rules are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I might be misunderstanding. Let me check all NT6 rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19\n\nSo NT6 can only go to other non-terminals. Therefore, to get a terminal from NT6, it must be via a chain of productions. But wait, in the rules for NT6, they all lead to other NTs, except maybe for a direct terminal.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I missed a NT6 production elsewhere. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the given grammar, under NT6, the rules are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19\n\nSo none of these directly produce a terminal. That can't be right because the string starts with t39, which is a terminal. So perhaps I'm misremembering, or maybe it's not directly NT6 \u2192 t39. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar.\n\nWait, looking again, under NT24: NT24 \u2192 t14, but that's a separate rule. Wait, no, under NT6, there's also NT6 \u2192 t20? Let me confirm:\n\nLooking through the NT6 rules, I don't see NT6 directly producing a terminal. All rules for NT6 go to non-terminals. Wait, that can't be because the grammar must produce terminals. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 is part of a larger chain that eventually produces a terminal. So let's think: S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo first, let's process NT6. Maybe NT6 can derive t39 through a series of substitutions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the entire derivation path.\n\nLet me try to see what each production for NT6 leads to. Since all rules for NT6 go to other non-terminals, I need to see how those can derive to terminals.\n\nStarting with NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19.\n\nNow, NT27's rules are:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (from earlier, like NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7)\n- NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n\nSo, let's see NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Now, NT7's rules: NT7 \u2192 t66 or t73. So t7 is either 66 or 73.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t39, so maybe NT27 isn't involved here. Alternatively, perhaps NT27 can lead to t39.\n\nWait, looking at NT7 rules: NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'. So t7 is either 66 or 73. So maybe through NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18, and then NT12 and NT18 have their own rules.\n\nWait, but none of these directly lead to t39. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19. Let's see NT33's rules:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nSo NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17. Now, NT31's rules include some paths leading to terminals:\n\nNT31 has:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0 (which is 't66')\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0 again\n- ETc.\n\nWait, perhaps NT31 can derive to 't66' through one of its rules.\n\nBut where does t39 come from then? Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT6 production.\n\nWait, perhaps another NT6 rule I missed. Let me re-examine the NT6 rules:\n\nWait, in the initial list, the user provided:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19\n\nSo, none of these directly produce t39. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t39 comes from NT17 or another NT rule.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, perhaps other rules can lead to t39. For example, NT17 \u2192 t66 or t40.\n\nWait, let me re-examine all the rules. Maybe I'm missing an NT6 \u2192 t39.\n\nWait, no, the rules for NT6 only go to other non-terminals. So that's confusing because the string starts with t39, which must come from NT6 or another NT.\n\nWait, maybe not. Perhaps NT6 is part of a larger chain. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and then NT6 derives to some NTs which eventually produce the first t39.\n\nSo let's see: starting with NT6. To get t39, perhaps NT6 can derive through a chain that produces t39.\n\nLooking again, perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25. NT21's rules: NT21 \u2192 NT0 (t66), NT17 (t40), etc. Wait, but none of these directly produce t39.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Wait, but t7 leads to t66 or t73. So I'm not getting t39 that way.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing some NT6 production that directly leads to t39, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps the first t in the string is from NT15. Let me check NT15: NT15 \u2192 't65'.\n\nNo, that's t65, which is not relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's coming from NT19 \u2192 't47', but that's t47, not t39.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let's try to see how 't39' can be produced. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t39 except via a chain.\n\nWait, looking at NT24 \u2192 t28, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe NT17 \u2192 t40 or t66. Not t39.\n\nWait, I'm stuck here. Maybe 't39' is produced by a different NT that I'm not considering.

{"custom_id":"request-43","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t54 t47 t20` is generated by the given CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This simplifies parsing since each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the string `t54 t47 t20`, it's a sequence of terminals. Each 't' followed by a number. My goal is to see if there's a derivation that starts from the start symbol S and results in this string.\n\nThe start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S must be split into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. Each of these will eventually derive a terminal string.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34\n   Now, I need to see if NT6 can derive 't54' and NT34 can derive 't47 t20'.\n\nBut wait, NT34 has a production NT34 \u2192 NT15 NT24. Let me check NT15 and NT24.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 has a few productions, like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19, etc. The tricky part is that some produce terminals, others produce non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by handling S:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\nSo, the entire string will be the concatenation of what NT6 and NT34 derive.\n\nGiven the string is three tokens, it's possible that each NT6 and NT34 derive two tokens each, or one of them might have a longer sequence.\n\nWait, the string is `t54 t47 t20`, three tokens. S has two productions, so perhaps each NT6 and NT34 produce one and two tokens respectively? Or both produce two tokens each, but one of them is split in the middle, but that might involve more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 produces 't54' and NT34 produces 't47 t20', but let's see how.\n\nFirst, let's check NT34's production:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT15 NT24\nSo, NT34 must be split into NT15 and NT24. Let's see their productions.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\nNT24 \u2192 NT14 NT? Hmm, looking at NT24's productions: NT24 \u2192 NT14 NT31 or NT14 NT21 or NT27 NT17 or others. Wait, actually, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT24 is defined as:\nNT24 \u2192 NT14 NT31 or NT14 NT21 or NT27 NT17 or others? Wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar is extensive, so let me list all relevant productions for NT24, NT15, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n- NT24 \u2192 NT14 NT31 or NT14 NT21 or etc., but checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through, the productions for NT24 are:\n\nWait, the user's grammar list includes:\n\nNT24 \u2192 NT14 NT31\nNT24 \u2192 NT14 NT21\nNT24 \u2192 NT27 NT17\n\nSo NT24 can be split into multiple combinations. Similarly, NT15 is:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n\nSo NT15's production leads to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string is three tokens, so maybe NT34 produces two tokens, 't47' and 't20', but let's see.\n\nWait, I need to track the derivation:\n\nLet me think of the overall derivation.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo, the string is the concatenation of what NT6 and NT34 produce. If the string has three tokens, perhaps NT6 produces two tokens and NT34 produces one, but I need to check the possibilities.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, most non-terminals have productions that produce two non-terminals. So, perhaps each of NT6 and NT34 must expand into two tokens each, making a total of four tokens? But the string has three tokens. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, wait. NT6 and NT34 each expand into a sequence of terminal symbols. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 can be derived as:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT20\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (again)\nWait, more importantly, some of these productions produce terminals directly. For example, in the given, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 is one option, but another option is NT6 \u2192 't20' (since looking at the grammar entries, under NT6, there's a production NT6 \u2192 't20'). Wait, no, looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking back, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT20\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT25 NT49\nWait, actually, the user provided the grammar with a list of productions, and here is one:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nWait, in the list, there is a line: NT6 \u2192 't20'. So, that's a production where NT6 directly produces the terminal 't20'.\n\nSimilarly, other NTs have such direct terminal productions.\n\nSo, in that case, when expanding NT6, we can have 't20' directly, or other combinations leading to more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT34:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT15 NT24\nAnd then, we need to see what NT15 and NT24 produce.\n\nWait, but if the string is `t54 t47 t20`, the last part is 't20', which matches the direct production from NT6. So, the 't20' could come from the NT6 part.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the string is NT6's derivation concatenated with NT34's derivation. So, if NT6 \u2192 't20', then the first part is 't20', and NT34 must produce the remaining 't54 t47'.\n\nWait, but the string is 't54 t47 t20', so if NT6 is 't20', then NT34 must be 't54 t47'.\n\nSo, that would mean NT34 \u2192 NT15 NT24, which then must expand to 't54 t47'.\n\nBut NT15 and NT24 can each be terminals or non-terminals. Let's see their productions:\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\nThen, NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT4 \u2192 't29' or other terminals?\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT15: NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4. So it's two non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 NT14 NT31 or others. Let's check one possible path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a step-by-step approach.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34\n\nWe need the entire string to be derived from these two.\n\nSo, the string is `t54 t47 t20`. So, let's say NT6 \u2192 't54' and NT34 \u2192 't47 t20'. But that would give a total of three tokens: 't54' + 't47' + 't20' \u2192 three tokens, which matches the string length.\n\nWait, so if NT6 \u2192 't54' and NT34 \u2192 't47 t20', then the entire string is 't54 t47 t20', which matches.\n\nSo, let's see if that's possible.\n\nFirst, let's check if NT6 can produce 't54':\n\nLooking at the grammar, does NT6 have a production that directly yields 't54'? Looking through the productions for NT6:\n\nLooking at the list of productions for NT6: I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20' among others. Wait, so NT6 can produce 't20' directly. Another production is NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. Also, NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19, which is a left recursion. Another is NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25. NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT0. And another is NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19.\n\nWait, so 't54' isn't an option for NT6 directly.

The string to evaluate is `t37 t66 t83 t54`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce terminals. This structure makes it efficient to parse using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not supposed to use that here, I'll need another approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT6 NT34. So the string we're evaluating must be the leftmost derivation of this start symbol.\n\nThe string given is four tokens: `t37`, `t66`, `t83`, `t54`. Since each step in the derivation produces two symbols (non-terminals), the number of tokens in the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Here, it's 4 tokens, which is 2^2, so n=2. That suggests the derivation took two steps beyond the start symbol.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first two symbols must be derived from NT6 and NT34. Looking at the grammar, NT31 has a production to 't43' and another to 't35', but since 't43' is a terminal in the string, it's in NT31's productions. Wait, the string has 't37', 't66', 't83', 't54'. So maybe I should look for where these terminals appear.\n\nLet me check each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals produce them. \n\n- t37 appears in NT27 \u2192 't72' or 't66' and NT11 \u2192 't83' and 't54' and NT21 \u2192 't71' and 't29'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT21 has 't71' and 't29' as its productions. So t37 is not directly in NT21. Wait, no, in the grammar, looking at NT21, it's NT11 \u2192 NT27 NT28 and NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15, etc. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nLet me go through each terminal in the string and see where they appear.\n\nt37: Looking for where this terminal is produced. Checking the grammar, I see NT18 \u2192 't22' and 't66', but that's not t37. Hmm, looking through all the rules, I don't see a production that directly gives t37 except maybe if I go deeper. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT21 \u2192 't71' and 't29'. Oh, wait, NT21 produces t37? Wait, no, in the rules under NT21, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the initial rules, under NT21: NT21 \u2192 NT4 NT15 and NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4, etc. Then, looking at the terminals:\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look at the grammar again step by step.\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of rules, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and right-hand side with two symbols (could be terminals or non-terminals). I need to find which non-terminals produce the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string is `t37 t66 t83 t54`, which has four tokens, so starting from S, we have two steps.\n\nSo the first step produces two symbols, and each subsequent step doubles the count.\n\nLet me break this down:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So after S, we have NT6 and NT34.\n\n2. Each of NT6 and NT34 must produce two symbols in the next step. So NT6 \u2192 something and NT34 \u2192 something else.\n\nBut we need to trace through each token in the string, so let's see:\n\nThe string is t37, t66, t83, t54.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's a collection of production rules. Each rule has a non-terminal on the left side and a combination of non-terminals and terminals on the right side. CNF requires that each production has two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. All terminal symbols are leaves, and non-terminals are internal nodes in the parse tree.\n\nI notice that some rules have only terminals on the right, like `NT10 -> 't77'` or `NT1 -> 't61'`. These are leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe string to check is `t81 t29 t12 t28 t81`. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me first check the start symbol S. From the grammar, S is defined as `S -> NT6 NT34`. So any string derived from S must start with NT6 and NT34, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t81. Let me see which non-terminal can produce t81.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals have productions that result in t81. For example:\n- NT20 has a production NT20 -> NT15 NT0. Hmm, not directly t81.\nWait, actually, looking more closely, I see a rule like `NT31 -> NT31 NT31`, but I'm looking specifically for t81.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for rules where a non-terminal directly produces t81. Let me scan through each production.\n\nLooking through:\n- NT27: NT27 -> NT7 NT7, etc., but no 't81'\n- NT6: NT6 -> NT27 NT19, etc.\n- NT4: NT4 -> 't29', which matches t29.\nWait, maybe I'm focusing too much on t81. Let's see which non-terminals produce t81.\n\nLooking for rules that have 't81' on the right-hand side.\n\nI see:\n- NT21 -> 't37', etc.\n- NT22 -> 't22' under certain rules?\nWait, looking through the rules provided, I see:\n\nAt the bottom, I see:\n\n- NT21 -> 't29'\n- NT22 -> 't77' or 't10' or 't25' depending on the rule. For example, `NT22 -> NT6 NT15` and `NT22 -> NT4 NT15` etc. Also, one of the NT22 rules is `NT22 -> 't77'`.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the easier way is to try to parse the string step by step, using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is t81 t29 t12 t28 t81.\n\nI'll try to break this down.\n\nFirst, S->NT6 NT34. So the string must be a sequence where the first part splits into NT6 and NT34. So I need to see if t81 can be the result of NT6 and then NT34, but actually, S produces NT6 and NT34, so the string is a concatenation of the derivations of NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, let's see if 't81' can be derived from NT6. Let's see the rules for NT6.\n\nNT6 is defined as:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\nNone of these produce 't81'. So NT6 might only generate t20, t27, etc., but not t81. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can produce t81. Let's look through all NT productions:\n\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT3 -> 't3'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT5?\nWait, looking through, I see NT6 has a rule that can produce 't52' via NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: in the string, the first token is t81. Which non-terminal produces t81, and can it be connected through the grammar?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see that NT21 -> 't37', and NT22 has several rules, including `NT22 -> 't77'`, `NT22 -> 't10'`, `NT20 -> 't45'` etc. I don't see any rule that produces t81 directly. Hmm, maybe t81 is produced by some non-terminal that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, looking again, the user provided a long list of grammar rules. Let me go through each production to see if any produce t81.\n\nI see:\n\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT17 \u2192 no\n- NT10 -> 't12' \u2192 no\n- NT19 -> 't47' \u2192 no\n- NT12 -> NT1 NT34 \u2192 no\n- NT22 has rules: NT22 -> NT4 NT15 \u2192 no, but another rule: NT22 -> NT7 NT19 \u2192 no, and another: NT22 -> 't77' \u2192 no\n- NT24 -> NT14 \u2192 no\n- Wait, what about NT21: NT21 -> 't29' \u2192 no\n- NT27: NT27 -> NT7 NT7 \u2192 no, but another rule is NT15 -> 't65' \u2192 no\n- NT7: NT7 -> 't66' and another line says NT7 -> 't73' \u2192 both, but NT7 is also the same as having 't66' and 't73'?\nWait, perhaps not. The rules for NT7 might have two different productions.\n\nLooking again, the rules are:\n\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n\nSo NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'. Not t81.\n\nLooking through all NT6 rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 \u2192 outputs t66 or t73, then NT19 can produce 't47', 't23', etc. So maybe through NT6, but the resulting string parts may not combine to t81.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me try to parse the entire string step by step, starting from S.\n\nThe string is t81 t29 t12 t28 t81.\n\nLet me break it into tokens: [t81, t29, t12, t28, t81]\n\nEach token must come from a non-terminal's expansion. Starting with the first token, t81. Which non-terminal can produce t81?\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't81'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see 't81' is not mentioned in any production directly. Wait, perhaps I need to see if 't81' is produced by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, let's look at NT22's rules: I see `NT22 -> 't77'` and `NT22 -> 't22'` and another is `NT22 -> 't38'`. Hmm, no 't81' there.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe 't81' is produced by a non-terminal that I'm not seeing. Let me check each rule again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT21 -> 't29', which is t29, so not t81.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any non-terminal can produce t81 through multiple steps. For example, is there a chain where a non-terminal expands into another that produces t81.\n\nWait, perhaps t81 is at the end of a chain. Let me think about the possible non-terminals that can produce the first token t81.\n\nIf I can't find any, then the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, another approach: check if each token can be matched by any non-terminal.\n\n- t81: can any NT \u2192 something ending with t81?\n\nLooking through all the rules again. It seems none directly produce t81. So is t81 even in the language? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t23 t0 t11 t81 t28`. So, I need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see it's filled with a lot of rules. Some non-terminals are connected to terminals. My approach should be to see how each part of the string might connect back to the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, every string derived from S must start with NT6 and NT34. But wait, in our string, the first token is t23, which is a terminal. So I need to check which non-terminals can produce t23.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT19 and NT34 produce 't47' and 't3' respectively. But none of the non-terminals directly produce t23. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh, I see NT19 has a production \u2192 NT24 NT21, but further down, NT19 \u2192 't47'. How about the other rules?\n\nLooking through, I see NT22 \u2192 't77' and NT15 \u2192 't65', NT1 \u2192 't61', NT6 \u2192 't20', NT17 \u2192 't66', and others. Hmm, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't23' in the given rules. Wait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, looking carefully, the production NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, and then further down, NT24 \u2192 't14' and NT21 \u2192 't37'. But how does that combine? So, the production would be t14 t37. But our string has t23 first, so if t23 comes from NT19, then we'd need to have 't14 t37' somewhere, but the string has t23 followed by t0. Hmm, that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe t23 comes from another rule. Let me search the rules for possible non-terminals that produce 't23'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production for any non-terminal leading to t23. That's a problem. So maybe the string begins with t23, which is not possible because S starts with NT6 and NT34, which don't produce t23.\n\nWait, let me double-check the production rules. The NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, and then NT24 \u2192 't14' and NT21 \u2192 't37'. So when combined, NT19 would produce t14 t37. But we have t23 in the string, which is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe I should approach this differently. Maybe I should try to parse the string from the bottom up, using the given rules.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each token in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and then link them together correctly.\n\nThe string is: t23, t0, t11, t81, t28.\n\nSo, starting from the left, let's see each token:\n\n1. t23: Looking for which non-terminal can produce 't23'. From the rules, I don't see any direct production for t23. None of the NTs seem to have 't23' as a terminal. So perhaps t23 cannot be derived from any rule, making the entire string invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps t23 comes from a production that's further down the chain. Maybe through some intermediate non-terminals. Let me explore this.\n\nLooking at the production NT22 \u2192 't77' or 't47' (multiple NT22 rules), but nothing produces t23. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the string was supposed to be built from NT11 or another non-terminal, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through each rule, the only token that comes close is NT19 \u2192 't47', which is 't47', not 't23'. NT24 \u2192 't14', NT21 \u2192 't37', but how does that help?\n\nAnother possibility is that the parsing would involve S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Let's see what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20' (from the rule NT6 \u2192 't20'). So S would produce t20 and NT34. Next, NT34 \u2192 't3', so S would produce t20 t3. But our string starts with t23, which is different from t20. So S can't directly start with t23, which seems impossible because S's first production is always t20 followed by t3, but the string starts with t23, which doesn't match either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar's structure. Maybe multiple-step derivations are necessary beyond the first step.\n\nWait, but if S always starts with NT6 NT34, which produce t20 and t3, then any string derived from S must start with t20 t3. However, our string starts with t23, which doesn't align with this.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar since the initial productions don't lead to t23 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but perhaps the initial step isn't the only possibility? No, because in Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol produces two non-terminals, which then produce other symbols. So S starts the process with NT6 and NT34. Their productions would generate the first two symbols, which in this case are t20 and t3. Since our string starts with t23, it can't be formed by this grammar.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the string isn't generated by the given grammar because the first token doesn't match any possible start production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I notice that all elements are terminals, so the string must be derived from the start symbol S, which is broken down into NT6 and NT34. \n\nStarting with S -> NT6 NT34, I need to see if both NT6 and NT34 can derive the respective parts of the string. \n\nLet's tackle NT6. The productions for NT6 are:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nSo, from NT6, we have two options. Let's see what each option can produce.\n\nFirst option: NT6 -> NT27 NT19\nLooking at NT27:\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7 (since NT27 has another production, but looking at it, the main one is NT27 -> NT7 NT7.

Let me check the NT7 productions again. Oh, I see NT7 -> 't66' or 't73'. So, 't83' is not directly produced by NT7. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps NT7 can be part of a larger chain. Let me trace all possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first option for NT6 is leading to something else.

So, looking at the grammar, does any production start with t83? Wait, the non-terminals all expand into a combination, but let's check the terminals:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that certain NTs map to specific tokens. For example, NT1 -> 't61', NT2 -> 't28', NT3 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each step in the derivation is a non-terminal expanding into two terminals, so the overall string length should be 2^n where n is the number of productions applied. The string has 6 symbols, so n=3.\n\nWait, but S is S -> NT6 NT34, which is two symbols. Then each NT6 and NT34 would split into two each, leading to four symbols, then each of those into two each, leading to eight, but perhaps that's not the case. Alternatively, the string length is 6, which is 2^3. So perhaps 3 productions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me instead look for each token in the string and see which NTs produce them.\n\nt83: Looking through all the terminal mappings, I don't see NT that produces t83. Wait, did I miss any?

That means t83 is not produced by any terminal rule in the grammar. But that can't be right because the string has 't83', which means the grammar must produce it.

{"custom_id":"request-121","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The string is `t80 t77 t80 t80 t66 t61 t45`.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe starting symbol is S, and its production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the string must start with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6, there are two productions:\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nSo, for the first step, I need to see which production applies. Let's check both paths.\n\nStarting with NT6, if I choose the first production, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. Now, both NT27 and NT19 are non-terminals. I'll need to expand these.\n\nFrom NT27, the productions are:\n1. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (from one of the options)\n2. NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18 (another option)\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT27 has two rules:\n1. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n2. NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n\nBut also, NT27 is mentioned elsewhere with NT7 and NT7 again. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, correction: In the grammar, NT27 has these productions:\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nSo, when NT27 is expanded, it can go to either of those two.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 has productions:\n- NT19 \u2192 't47' or another production?\n\nWait, looking at NT19, the productions are:\n- NT19 \u2192 't47' (from lines where NT19 -> 't47')\nWait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT19 appears in lines where it's defined as:\n- NT19 -> 't47' directly.\n- Also, in another line, NT22 -> 't77' but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, actually, looking carefully, I see NT19 has two versions in the grammar. Let me check.\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT19 is defined as:\n- NT19 -> 't47'\nBut elsewhere, for example:\n- NT22 -> 't77' might not be relevant.\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar has:\n- NT19 -> 't47' (so directly a terminal 't47')\nIs there another production for NT19? Let me check.\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see:\n- NT19 -> 't47'\n- NT0 -> 't66' (but that's not relevant)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing another production. Let me verify.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each line starting with a rule is either NTo production or another NT.\n\nLooking at the lines, I see NT19 only has one production: NT19 -> 't47'\n\nOkay, so NT19 can only be replaced by 't47', a terminal. Therefore, the expansion of NT19 will directly produce 't47'.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t80 t77 t80 t80 t66 t61 t45`.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe string starts with t80, t77, t80, t80, t66, t61, t45.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the first two symbols should be the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLet's consider the first production path: S\u2192NT6 NT34.\n\nSuppose NT6 expands to NT27 NT19, and NT34 expands to, well, what's NT34's production? Looking at the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the production rules are listed, so let me find NT34.\n\nLooking through, I see NT34 has the production NT34 \u2192 't3', according to lines like NT34 -> 't3' and others. So, NT34 can be expanded to 't3' directly.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 would expand to NT6 NT34 \u2192 [NT6\u2192NT27 NT19] 't3'. But wait, that would mean the string starts with NT27 NT19 't3', but in our string, the first symbol is 't80', which is a terminal. So, perhaps that's problematic.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconsider the production paths.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to generate the string step by step. Since the string is all terminals, each symbol in the string must be a terminal or the result of non-terminals expanding into the string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is seven tokens: t80 t77 t80 t80 t66 t61 t45.\n\nEach of these must come from the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first token must come from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nSo, first token is t80. Let's see which production for NT6 can generate t80.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nSo, we need to see if NT27 or NT33 can produce t80.\n\nLooking at NT27, which can expand to either NT7 NT7 or NT12 NT18.\n\nIf NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18, then let's see NT12 and NT18.\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34. So NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34. NT1 and NT34 have their own expansions.\n\nWait, but wait: our first expansion is NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. So the first token is the first symbol of NT27's expansion.\n\nIf NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18, then the first symbol would be NT12's first symbol. But NT12 is a non-terminal, so it must be expanded.\n\nWait, but the first token is t80, which is a terminal. So, if NT6's expansion is NT27 NT19, then the first token would have to be a terminal from NT27 or NT19.\n\nBut looking at NT27's productions:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7: each NT7 is a non-terminal, which may expand to 't66' or 't73'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' comes from NT7 -> 't66' (as seen under NT7).\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't73' (also).\n\nSo, if NT7 is expanded to 't66' or 't73'.\n\nBut wait, in our string, the first symbol is 't80', which is a terminal. So, unless there's a production that can produce 't80' directly from a non-terminal, perhaps that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 can expand to a terminal. Let's check NT6's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only productions for NT6 are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nSo, NT6 cannot produce any terminal directly; all its expansions start with non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol in the string must be part of NT27 or NT33.\n\nBut the first symbol is t80, which would require that either NT27 or NT33 can produce t80 as their first symbol. However, looking at NT27 and NT33, I don't see any production that starts with t80.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the production for NT6 is such that the first symbol of the expansion of NT27 is t80. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT27 producing t80. Instead, NT27 can only produce other non-terminals or 't66' and 't73'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT27 has two productions:\n  1. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n  2. NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n\n- NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\nHmm, none of these produce t80.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 can expand into t80. Wait, in the grammar, for NT6, the productions are only to other non-terminals, so no, NT6 cannot produce a terminal directly. Therefore, the first symbol must be from NT27 or NT33's expansions.\n\nBut looking at NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmmm, where do I even start? Let me see.\n\nFirst, I remember that with CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So every step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other things. That might help in building the parse tree.\n\nLet me list out all the production rules to make it clearer. But that's a lot\u201465 rules! Maybe I can focus on the symbols in the string and see how they can be derived.\n\nThe string is `t61 t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12`. So each token is a terminal. I think I need to reconstruct a derivation starting from S and ending in this string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, `t61`. From the grammar, I see that S -> NT6 NT34. So S needs to derive to two parts. Let's see, looking at NT6, is there a production that ends with t61? Let me check NT6's productions.\n\nLooking at NT6, I see several rules:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\nWait, actually, some are duplicates. So possible ways: NT6 can go to NT27 and NT19, or NT33 and NT19, or NT21 and NT25.\n\nLooking for t61 as the first part. Let me see the options:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT14->'t61'. So if NT14 is one of the two parts from S, then S can be NT14 NT28.\n\nWait, S->NT6 NT34. So I need to see if NT6 can derive to NT14 and something else. Because NT34 might need to do something else. Let me see.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me see what each terminal in the string comes from.\n\nBreaking down the string:\nt61, t11, t10, t22, t30, t38, t81, t12.\n\nLooking for how each can be produced.\n\nt61: from NT14.\nt11: from NT11->'t11'? Let me check the rules. Yes, NT11->'t11' is a production.\n\nt10: Looking through, yes, NT10->'t12' and NT10->'t84'. Wait, also NT10->'t12' and 't84'. Wait, no, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, the rules under NT10: NT10->'t66' seems to be an option? Wait, no. Wait, looking again:\n\nThe rules for NT10:\n- NT10 -> NT14 NT31\n- NT10 -> NT14 NT31\nWait, no, in the given grammar, let me check: it says:\n\n\"NT10 -> 't12' and also NT10 -> 't84'? Wait, looking at the grammar, under NT10:\n\nNT10 -> NT14 NT31\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the NT10 entries:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n\"NT10 -> 't12'\", yes, somewhere. Let me see: the user provided the grammar, let me scan for 't12'.\n\nYes, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n\"NT10 -> 't12'\". Also, \"NT10 -> 't84'\". So NT10 can produce t12 or t84.\n\nBut in the string, the second symbol is t11, which is an NT11, which directly produces t11.\n\nWait, but when I'm deriving, all the symbols in the string must be either terminals or non-terminals that can derive into the right sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building the parse tree starting from the symbols.\n\nLet me try to construct the derivation.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t61, which is from NT14.\n\nS -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo, the first step is to have S produce NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo S => NT6 NT34.\n\nNow, NT6 and NT34 must be expanded in such a way that the first symbol t61 comes from NT6. So NT6 must derive to something that ends with t61 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules, I see that NT6 can produce NT14 NT28. So let's have NT6 become NT14 NT28.\n\nSo now, the string becomes NT14 NT28 NT34.\n\nThen, NT14 is 't61', so that matches the first symbol. So NT14 becomes t61.\n\nNow, the string is t61 NT28 NT34.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t11, which is NT11. So the next part after t61 should come from NT28 NT34. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe not.\n\nWait, the string after t61 is t11, t10, etc., so the next part after t61 is t11. So the string after the first two symbols is 't61 t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think differently: Each symbol in the string must come from some part of the derivation.\n\nThe entire string is derived from S, which splits into NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo after S, we have two parts: NT6 and NT34.\n\nEach must be expanded into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals such that when combined, they form the given string. But wait, in the given string, the order is t61, t11, t10, etc. But the initial step is NT6 and NT34. So, perhaps NT6 expands to t61 and something else, or NT34 to something else.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's start from the parse tree approach.\n\nThe string is: t61 t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12.\n\nThis is a sequence of eight terminals. Since each production in CNF is binary, the number of nodes in the parse tree should be 8 - 1 = 7 splits, leading to 8 leaves. So that's consistent.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree.\n\nThe root is S, which splits into NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo the two subtrees of S are NT6 and NT34.\n\nEach of these needs to produce a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t61, which is part of the NT6 subtree.\n\nSo let's see what NT6 can produce. Looking at the rules of NT6:\n\nNT6 can produce, for example, NT14 NT28.\n\nIf NT6 becomes NT14 NT28, then NT14 is 't61', so that's the first symbol.\n\nSo NT6 would be t61 followed by NT28.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after t61, the next symbol is t11. So after t61, we have t11, which is part of the subtree NT28 NT34. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misaligning. Let me think again.\n\nEach non-terminal in the string has to be expanded into terminals and non-terminals. The string is constructed by expanding the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to reverse the problem.\n\nLet's see: the entire string is t61 t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12.\n\nEach part of the string must come from a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting from S, which splits into NT6 and NT34.\n\nAssume NT6 becomes t61, which is 't61'. So that's the first symbol.\n\nThen NT34 must derive into the rest of the string: t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12.\n\nBut wait, the entire string is eight symbols. So if S produces NT6 and NT34, then the two subtrees must together make the eight symbols.\n\nWait, that can't happen because S has two children, leading to two sequences that combine to the eight symbols.\n\nBut the initial step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\n\nSo NT6 and NT34 each need to expand into sequences of terminals and non-terminals whose concatenation is t61 t11 t10 t22 t30 t38 t81 t12.\n\nBut this can only be true if NT6 expands into t61 followed by something that expands into the rest,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Since the grammar uses leftmost derivation in CYK, perhaps the way to approach this is to see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So NT6 and NT34 must generate the first and then the rest of the string, or wait, no, the entire string is a concatenation of the two parts from NT6 and NT34. So to check if the entire string is generated, the first part (from NT6) must be the first few tokens, and the second part (from NT34) must be the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated by another way, like having S \u2192 NT6 NT34, but then NT6 could be NT2, which is a terminal, and NT34 is t3, but that's not in the string. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should look at the structure. Let me think about each token and see where they can come from.\n\nStarting with t28: from which NT can this come? Looking at the rules, I see NT2 \u2192 t28. So if there's an NT2, it can generate t28.\n\nSimilarly, t38: is this a terminal? Looking through the rules, NT25 \u2192 t49, NT21 \u2192 t37, NT21 \u2192 t81, etc. Wait, but I don't see t38 as a terminal. Oh, wait, maybe NT38 is a non-terminal that produces t38? But I don't see a production for NT38 in the grammar. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, the rule is that the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. So if a terminal is in the string, it must be the result of a production rule for that non-terminal. So for t38, there must be a production like NT38 \u2192 t38 or some A \u2192 t38 if NT38 has that rule.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT38. The closest is NT25 \u2192 t49, NT21 \u2192 t37 and t81. So t38 is not directly a terminal, but perhaps it's part of a non-terminal's derivation.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Maybe I should step back. If the string includes t38, which isn't a direct terminal of any non-terminal, perhaps that's an issue. Or maybe there's a way for NT25 to produce NT19, etc., which eventually leads to t38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying where t38 comes from. Let me check the rules again. NT19 \u2192 t47, NT34 \u2192 t3, etc. So, maybe NT25's production leads to something that can generate t38.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look more carefully. Let's list all the rules that have terminals:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 t61\n- NT4 \u2192 t29\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT15 \u2192 t65\n- NT19 \u2192 t47, t23\n- NT22 \u2192 t77, etc.\n- NT34 \u2192 t3\n- Similarly, NT7 can produce t66 or t73.\n\nWait, but t38 isn't listed as a terminal. That suggests that perhaps it's a derivation from a non-terminal. But since it's in the string, the grammar must have a path where some non-terminal generates it. Maybe I missed it. Let me check each production:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t12\n- NT11 \u2192 t11\n- NT12 \u2192 t68\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n- NT17 \u2192 t66\n- NT18 \u2192 t22\n- NT22 \u2192 t37 (is that right?) Wait, check the rules again:\n\nLooking through, I see NT27 \u2192 t72, NT15 \u2192 t65, NT19 \u2192 t47, t23, NT10 \u2192 t84, and others. I don't see a direct production for t38. Wait, but in the rules, maybe I'm missing one. Let me scan all the NT productions again.\n\nOh, wait, maybe I missed NT13, but there's no NT13 in the rules. So perhaps t38 isn't a terminal at all. But the string has it, which would mean that the string is not possible, since the grammar doesn't produce t38 as a terminal. Alternatively, maybe it's coming from a derivation where some non-terminal produces t38 via rules involving other non-terminals that expand into t38.\n\nWait, but in the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t38. That means that the string includes a terminal that the grammar doesn't generate, which would make the string invalid. But I'm not sure if I missed it. Let me check all the NT rules again.\n\nLooking again, I don't see t38 as any of the terminals in the rules. So that suggests that t38 is not a terminal in any production, which would mean it's not possible for the grammar to produce that token in the string. But then, how does the string contain it? Maybe I made a mistake in looking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is incorrect, but the user wants me to determine if it's possible. Wait, but if t38 is not a terminal in any production, then any string containing t38 would automatically be invalid. So the answer would be No, right? But I need to make sure I'm not missing any rule.\n\nWait, let me check the rules again. I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 t66, NT7 \u2192 t73\n- NT6 \u2192 t20, etc.\n\nNo, there's no production that directly or indirectly results in t38. So the string contains a terminal that is not produced by any non-terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar. So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's think again. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar structure. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. The starting symbol is S.\n\nLooking at S, the first production is S -> NT6 NT34. So, any string generated by this grammar starts with NT6 followed by NT34. Wait, but the string starts with `t3`, which is a terminal. Let me see which NTs map to terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, some of the NTs map to terminals. For example, NT10 -> 't77', NT1->'t61', etc. So my first task is to trace how these NTs can lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me list out which NTs map directly to terminals:\n\nNT34 -> 't3'\nNT:\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT6 -> 't20'\nNT10 -> 't77'\nNT11 -> 't83' (Wait, the string has `t3`, then `t84` \u2014 not sure about this one)\nNT12 -> 't68'\nNT14 -> 't72'\nNT15 -> 't65'\nNT17 -> 't66'\nNT18 -> 't22'\nNT19 -> 't47', 't23' (since NT19 has two rules)\nNT20 -> 't45'\nNT21 -> 't37'\nNT22 -> 't77', 't10', 't25'\nNT24 -> 't14'\nNT25 -> 't49', 't57'\nNT27 -> 't72', 't73'\nNT31 -> 't31', 't35', 't43' \u2014 seems like looping\nNT33 -> 't30', 't55'\nNT4 -> 't29', 't36'\nNT6 has multiple options, like 't20', 't27', etc.\nOkay, so in the string, the first term is `t3`. Looking at the grammar, only NT34 -> 't3'. So the first part must be NT34.\n\nSo the string starts with NT34, which is 't3', then followed by NT34 or another NT. Wait, S -> NT6 NT34. Wait, no, S is split into NT6 NT34, meaning S generates strings that start with NT6 followed by NT34. So for S, the entire string must be split as NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nBut the given string has more than two terms, so it's likely that the NT6 and NT34 each expand into more non-terminals, which in turn produce the subsequent 't's.\n\nLet me try to parse the string by checking the possible production sequences.\n\nThe string is: `t3 t84 t57 t53 t65 t20 t28 t38 t29`\n\nWait, but the starting symbol S is NT6 NT34. So the first part is NT6, which must produce the initial 't3', then the next part is NT34, which must produce the next 't84'. Hmm, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, no. S is NT6 NT34, so the entire string must be the combination of whatever NT6 produces and whatever NT34 produces. But NT34 is a separate NT.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't3', the next is 't84'. So perhaps the first part is NT6 generating 't3', but wait, no. Wait, S is NT6 followed by NT34. So the entire string is produced by NT6 expanding to the first part and NT34 expanding to the rest.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to model it as the string must be split into two parts: the first part is what NT6 expands to, and the second part is what NT34 expands to. But the given string is one single sequence of 't's. So maybe I need to find a split point where the first part is expandable by NT6 and the second part by NT34.\n\nBut the string has 9 't's. So maybe the split is after 1 term, but that wouldn't create two separate expansions. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated by NT6 and NT34 in parallel, but since the string is a linear sequence, perhaps each NT contributes some part in a way that their concatenation forms the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string as a sequence where S generates NT6 followed by NT34, and each NT6 can expand into a string, then NT34 can expand into another string, and their concatenation forms the entire string.\n\nSo, for the string, the first part (to be generated by NT6) is the first few 't's, and the second part (to be generated by NT34) is the remaining 't's.\n\nLooking at the possible NTs and their expansions:\n\nLet me see what NT34 can generate.

The string I'm evaluating is \"t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 t83 t3 t35 t20\". The grammar is a lot, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can go to terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, all productions are binary and A can only be a non-terminal on the left. Also, the start symbol can generate a string of terminals, but each step replaces a non-terminal with two others until there's no non-terminal left.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S is at the heart of the grammar, and the string we're checking should start with NT6 and NT34. But wait, looking at the string, the first two elements are t40 and t37. Are these the start symbols? Or do the NT labels correspond to non-terminals that then produce these t's?\n\nWait, the NTs in the grammar are non-terminals, like NT6, NT14, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually produce a terminal string according to other productions. So for example, NT6 can produce certain terminals based on the productions given.\n\nHmm. So first, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Therefore, the string generated by S is the concatenation of whatever NT6 produces and whatever NT34 produces. So I need to split the string into two parts where the first part is generated by NT6 and the second part by NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 t83 t3 t35 t20.\n\nI need to check if the entire string can be split into two parts where NT6 produces the first part and NT34 produces the second part. Also, each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of terminals according to their production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can backtrack starting from S. Let's see if the string can be formed by S's production.\n\nWait, but I'm given the string as a sequence of terminals, so the first step is to check if S can generate that string by production. But S is the start symbol, so the string must be derived from S through a series of productions. So each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, until all non-terminals are resolved into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is derived as a binary tree, where each production splits into two parts, and so on, until the entire string is formed.\n\nGiven the string length is 10, perhaps we can think of the depth of the derivation. But maybe a better approach is to check if the first step is to expand S into NT6 and NT34, which produce the first and second parts of the string.\n\nSo let's take the first two symbols: t40 and t37. Wait, no, the string is a list, so the first symbol is t40, the second is t37, etc. Wait, no, actually, the string is \"t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 t83 t3 t35 t20\", so it's a list of terminals in order. So the entire string is t40 followed by t37, then t81, t40, t10, t66, t83, t3, t35, t20.\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the overall string is the concatenation of the strings generated by NT6 and NT34. So the first part of the string would be generated by NT6, the second by NT34.\n\nLet me check the grammar to see which non-terminals can produce these sequences. Starting with NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: in the grammar, NT6 can produce NT27 NT19, or NT33 NT19, or NT21 NT25, etc. Wait, but I need to see if any of these produce t40 or something else.\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, there are multiple productions for each non-terminal, but the ones that produce terminals are those with terminal strings assigned.\n\nLooking at NT6: There are several productions, but the ones where NT6 is on the left have terminals on the right, such as NT6 \u2192 't20', 't27', etc. Wait, no: looking back, the grammar has lines like NT34 \u2192 't3', NT25 \u2192 't49', etc.\n\nWait, no. For example, line: NT6 \u2192 't20' (from the grammar), and also NT17 \u2192 't66', etc. Wait, actually, I see that several non-terminals have direct productions to terminals, like NT6 \u2192 't20', NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73', NT0 \u2192 't66', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see the entire expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLet me see:\n\nNT6 has the following productions (looking through the grammar):\n\nI think in the grammar, NT6\u2192NT27 NT19, NT6\u2192NT33 NT19, NT6\u2192NT21 NT25.\n\nAnd also lines:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20', and others?\n\nWait, let me list all production rules for NT6:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nAlso, lines like 'NT6 \u2192 't20'', 'NT6 \u2192 't33'', etc. Wait, the grammar is a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find if NT6 can generate t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66. Wait, but that might be too long. Alternatively, perhaps I should check step by step.\n\nWait, in the given string, the entire string is \"t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 t83 t3 t35 t20\". That's 10 tokens. Let's split this into two parts based on the S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first part is from t40 to t20, and the second part is... Wait, but NT34's expansion must be another part.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is \"t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 t83 t3 t35 t20\".\n\nWe have to check if it's generated by S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the string is NT6's expansion followed by NT34's expansion.\n\nSo I need to see if the first part t40 t37 t81 t40 t10 t66 is generated by NT6, and the second part t83 t3 t35 t20 is generated by NT34.\n\nLet's check NT6's expansion first.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT6, let's see possible paths:\n\nProduction NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19.\n\nThen, NT27 can produce 't72' or 't73'.\n\nAssume NT27 \u2192 't72', then the part would be 't72' followed by NT19's expansion.\n\nWhat's NT19's production? Let's see: NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, and also production NT19 \u2192 't47', and maybe others.\n\nWait, checking NT19's productions: in the grammar, NT19's productions are:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n\nSo for NT19, it can produce 't47' directly, or it can expand further into NT24 and NT21.\n\nIf NT19 expands to 't47', then the full expansion would have a 't47' there. But in our first part of the string, the first token is t40, so perhaps NT6 shouldn't expand directly to t40, but more into non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline this more clearly.\n\nThe overall string is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with NT6's expansion and ends with NT34's expansion. So the first part of the string (let's say tokens 1-6: t40, t37, t81, t40, t10, t66) must come from NT6, and the latter part (t83, t3, t35, t20) from NT34.\n\nWait, maybe I can trace backwards from the end. Let's see if the last part can be derived from NT34.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT34, NT34 can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So every string generated by this grammar starts with NT6 followed by NT34. Let me write that down: the string should begin with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of these NT rules, both NT6 and NT34 seem to be non-terminals that can produce terminal symbols or other combinations.

Now, both NT6 and NT34 need to produce sequences of terminal symbols. Let's see what each can produce.\n\nFirst, looking at NT6: possible productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2.

NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nSo when we expand S, we get:\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT34.

So starting from S, which produces two symbols: A and B. So the string must be the concatenation of A and B's expansions. So the total number of tokens is len(A_expansion) + len(B_expansion).\n\nGiven that the string has 10 tokens, we can try to find if any A and B expansions sum to 10 tokens.\n\nLooking at possible A and B expansions:\n\nLet me list A options (from NT6):\n\nA1: NT27 NT19. Now, each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (since line: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7)\nBut wait, wait, looking back at the grammar: line says NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7.

{"custom_id":"request-203","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex, so I'll need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar consists of a set of productions, each starting with a non-terminal symbol on the left and having two non-terminal or terminal symbols on the right. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t25 t23 t3 t54 t71 t68 t49 t14 t39 t45 t12`.\n\nMy approach will be to work backwards from the string to see if I can derive it using the given grammar. This method is often called tracing the derivation or reduction, starting from the terminals and seeing if they can be replaced by non-terminals according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string in order: t25, t23, t3, t54, t71, t68, t49, t14, t39, t45, t12.\n\nI'll start by looking for the last few symbols, as they might correspond to the start symbol or a part of a production.\n\nLooking at the last symbol, t12. Scanning through the productions, I see NT12 has productions:\n- NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34\n- NT12 \u2192 NT14 NT31\n\nSo t12 can be generated by NT12. Therefore, I can replace t12 with NT12.\n\nNext, let's go one step back before t12, which is t45. So the string becomes: ..., t45, t71, t68, t49, t14, t39, t45, t71, t68, t49, t14, t12.\n\nWait, that might not be the right way to approach it. Instead, I should consider each terminal as a step in the derivation. Let me try again, working backward from the entire string.\n\nThe entire string is T = [t25, t23, t3, t54, t71, t68, t49, t14, t39, t45, t12]\n\nI'll consider starting from the right (the end of the string) and see if I can find a production that ends in the last few symbols.\n\nLooking at t12, I know it's from NT12, which expands to NT1 NT34 or NT14 NT31. So t12 is a terminal and could be part of a larger production.\n\nLet me try to identify possible non-terminals that can produce these terminals. I'll look for the rightmost symbols and see which part of the grammar can generate them.\n\nStarting with t12, which is from NT12. Let me replace t12 with NT12. Then the string becomes: T = [t25, t23, t3, t54, t71, t68, t49, t14, t39, t45, NT12]\n\nNow, I need to break down NT12 into its components. From the grammar, NT12 can be either NT1 and NT34 or NT14 and NT31. So, depending on which production we use, it will split the string into two parts.\n\nLet me first check the case where NT12 becomes NT14 and NT31. So t12 is replaced by NT14 NT31, making the string: [t25, t23, t3, t54, t71, t68, t49, t14, t39, t45, NT14, NT31]\n\nNow, looking at the penultimate part: t45, which is generated by NT45. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT4 doesn't have a production, but NT45 is a terminal. Wait, no, NT45 is a non-terminal, right? Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, no, the productions in the grammar all have non-terminals on the left, so the right-hand side can be non-terminals or terminals. So some of the productions in the grammar produce terminals. Let me list some productions that produce terminals:\n\nLooking back, I see NT15 \u2192 NT24 NT21, but NT24 \u2192 NT14 NT1? Wait, no, more accurately, I need to look through the productions to see where the right-hand side is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to make a list of which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't73' (so NT7 produces terminal t73)\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77' (twice in different productions)\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT22 \u2192 't77' (twice, as NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19 and also NT22 \u2192 't77')\n- NT4 \u2192 't39'\n- NT6 \u2192 't66' (appears multiple times)\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT27 \u2192 't77' in some cases\n- NT11 \u2192 't73' (twice)\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT10 \u2192 't12' (among others)\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n- NT23 \u2192 't54' or something?

{"custom_id":"request-208","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and C can't be the start symbol S. Also, all terminals are single symbols.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t22 t14 t66 t39 t36 t37 t35 t18 t14 t81 t12`. Let me first list out the tokens to see what's going on. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so it's a sequence of terminals. Each 't' represents a non-derivation, just a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit complex with many non-terminals. Each production seems to split into two parts, left and right, which are non-terminals. My approach should be to work backward from the string, trying to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the given productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT34. That means the derived string must start with the expansions of NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nThe input string starts with 't22', 't14', 't66', etc. Let me see what each of these corresponds to in the grammar. \n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I can map some terminals to non-terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 't20' is not correct because looking at the grammar, NT6 can expand into sequences, but some of its productions go to terminals, like NT6 \u2192 't20', 't33', 't52', etc. Wait, but NT6's productions are actually combinations, not terminals. Let me check: \n\nLooking back, the NT6 productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19  \nNT6 -> NT33 NT19  \nNT6 -> NT21 NT25  \nNT6 -> NT22 NT25  \nNT6 -> NT17 NT19  \nNT6 -> NT27 NT19  \nWait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me parse the grammar correctly.\n\nThe grammar is given as a list of productions. Each line is a production for a non-terminal on the left to two non-terminals on the right. For example, the first line is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Then NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, and so on.\n\nSo each production rule is A \u2192 BC, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals (possibly terminals in some cases, but in CNF, they should be non-terminals). Wait, no\u2014CNF only allows non-terminals on the right side; terminals are not allowed. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the grammar provided actually has some productions where the right side includes terminals, like NT6 \u2192 't20', which would mean that the grammar isn't strictly in CNF as I thought.\n\nWait, the initial statement says it's in Chomsky Normal Form, but looking at the productions, some of them have terminals on the RHS. For example, NT6 \u2192 't20' is a production. That can't be right because CNF requires all productions to have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS. So perhaps the grammar provided isn't actually in CNF, which is confusing because the initial statement says it is.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again. The grammar is presented with lines like S -> NT6 NT34. Then other lines like NT14 -> NT2 NT1, NT6 -> NT27 NT19, etc. But then I see that some lines end with terminals, like NT6 -> 't20', which suggests that the grammar is not in CNF. Maybe the initial statement was incorrect, or perhaps the grammar was slightly altered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't's are terminals representing non-terminals. For example, 't22' might actually be a non-terminal code, not a terminal. Wait, that could be the case. So maybe the grammar's RHS consists of non-terminals, but when they expand, they produce these 't' followed by numbers, which are actually the terminal symbols.\n\nSo, in that case, 't22' is a terminal, meaning that in the string we're checking, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because some productions in the grammar do have 't' as a result. For example, NT6 \u2192 't20' seems like it's expanding to a terminal. But in CNF, you can't have terminals on the RHS; all productions must be between non-terminals. So perhaps the grammar as given is not in CNF. Maybe it's converted into CNF, but some rules have terminals on the RHS because it's a subset of the original grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't' represents a unique symbol, but in this case, the grammar is supposed to be in CNF, meaning that each production must have two non-terminals on the right. So possibly, the 't's are part of the RHS, meaning the grammar is in unary, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed by assuming that the grammar is in CNF, so all RHS consist of two non-terminals. Then, any occurrence of 't' being on the RHS would mean it's a terminal, which would imply that the production has a terminal in the RHS, which isn't allowed in CNF. So perhaps the grammar provided isn't in CNF, but the user is asking me to process it as such. Alternatively, perhaps 't's are non-terminals, but that would mean their productions are given in the rules, but in the grammar, we don't see those. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should focus on the structure of the problem. The task is to determine if the given string is generated by the grammar, regardless of whether the grammar is correctly CNF or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't's in the string are actually non-terminals, and the grammar correctly represents them. But looking at the grammar, for example, NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, which is okay. But some productions have 't' as a result, like NT6 \u2192 't20', which would make the RHS have a terminal, meaning the grammar is not in CNF. So perhaps the user made a mistake, but the problem is to process it as given.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should treat the 't's with numbers as actual terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the approach is to start with the string and see if I can reduce it to the start symbol S by applying the inverse of the productions, i.e., for each production A \u2192 BC, in reverse, we can split the string into A and then process BC.\n\nBut let's see. The string is t22 t14 t66 t39 t36 t37 t35 t18 t14 t81 t12.\n\nLet me list them as individual tokens:\n\n[t22, t14, t66, t39, t36, t37, t35, t18, t14, t81, t12]\n\nI need to parse this from the left, trying to match the first part of the string to the RHS of a production.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the first step is to see if the string starts with a production that leads to NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, the first step would be to split the string into two parts: one that matches NT6 and the other that matches NT34.\n\n NT6 and NT34 are two non-terminals, which then produce sequences of terminals that should match the string.\n\nLet me try to see if the first token t22 can be associated with NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19  \nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19  \nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25  \nNT6 \u2192 NT22 NT25  \nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT19  \nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19  \nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list of lines, so let me make sure I parse them correctly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe first few productions are:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNT20 -> NT15 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT14 NT31\n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT11 -> NT27 NT28\n\nNT10 -> NT14 NT31\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT7\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT1 -> NT14 NT28\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\n\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t66 t25 t71 t29 t81 t77 t55 t14 t49 t39 t55 t84`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) requires that each production rule has either two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to only have rules where non-terminals produce two non-terminals except for the terminals, which can only appear as leaves.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string step by step using the grammar, trying to find a derivation from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. In CNF, the derivation would be such that each step combines two symbols at a time. The string has 12 terminals, so the derivation should have 11 production steps, reducing the symbols until only S remains.\n\nI'll start from the initial symbol S, which is derived from NT6 and NT34 (S \u2192 NT6 NT34).\n\nLet me see if the string starts correctly. The first symbol is t66. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0, but t66 can be derived from NT20 because NT20 \u2192 't45'. Wait, no, NT20 is a non-terminal and must be further split. Also, looking at NT6 \u2192 't20'? Wait, no, I think I might be misreading because the NT6 is a non-terminal that can generate t20 directly, right? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions, like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and also NT6 \u2192 't20'. So t20 is a terminal. So if the string starts with t66, which comes from NT17's production (NT17 \u2192 't66'), but actually, no. Let me check all terminal rules:\n\nLooking through, I see several NT's that can directly produce t66. Let me look for all NT's that produce t66.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'? Wait, I think I might have to check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, there are multiple rules where NT's can produce different terminals, including t66. Let me check each terminal production:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73' (since the rules are NT7 -> t66 and t73). So NT7 can produce t66 or t73.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't66'. So in the grammar, NT0 can produce t66.\n\nOther NT's might produce t66. Let me make a list:\n\n- NT7 (from NT7 \u2192 t66)\n- NT0 (from NT0 \u2192 t66)\n\nSo when I look at the string starting with t66, it could come from NT7 or NT0.\n\nWait, but how do they fit into the grammar? Let me think.\n\nThe string starts with t66, so that must be produced by some NT. Let's try both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The first t66 comes from NT7. Then, to have NT7 derived, it must have been split. Because NT7 is a non-terminal, so it must have been derived from a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT7's productions are NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73', so perhaps it's the leftmost or middle symbol in a chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which starts the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string and see if it can be built by leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work backward, trying to split the string into pairs that match the grammar's productions.\n\nEach step in the derivation would split a string into two parts, each part being a result of smaller productions until they reach the terminals.\n\nSo, for example, let's take the string:\n\nt66 t25 t71 t29 t81 t77 t55 t14 t49 t39 t55 t84\n\nWe need to see if this can be split in some way according to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT34. NT6 is a non-terminal. The string begins with t66, which as per the grammar, could be derived from NT7 (which is a non-terminal that can produce 't66'). But wait, S's production is NT6 \u2192 anything. So maybe S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the left side is NT6, the right side is NT34.\n\nSo to start, the first non-terminal to process is NT6, which needs to produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has several productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- Also, some others I might have missed, but it's clear that NT6 splits into other NTs.\n\nSince the first symbol is t66, which comes from NT7, but NT6 is a different non-terminal. So perhaps the first symbol t66 is produced by NT7, but since S is split into NT6 and NT34, the NT6 must be split first.\n\nWait, but for the first production, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. The left side is NT6, so the left side must derive into the starting part of the string.\n\nSo let's see, NT6 can be split into multiple possibilities until it reaches terminals, which would form the left side of the string.\n\nLooking at the options for NT6, possible first splits:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nSo let's try the first option: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nThen, NT27 can produce t7, t72, etc. From the grammar, NT27 has rules:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72'\n- NT27 \u2192 't73'\n- NT27's other productions?\n\nWait, looking at the given rules, I see:\n\nNT27 has:\n- NT27 \u2192 't72'\n- NT27 \u2192 't73'\nAdditionally, other rules like NT27 \u2192 't12' or others?\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't72', 't73', 't7', 't12'? Or wait, let me check the actual grammar rules.\n\nIn the provided grammar, for NT27:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72'\n- NT27 \u2192 't73'\nWait, I might have missed some. Let's recheck:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66', 't73'\nNT27 \u2192 't72', 't12'\n\nSo NT27 has two productions: to t72 and t12.\n\nSimilarly, NT19 \u2192 't47', 't23', 't15', etc.\n\nSo, if NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, then the first part of the string would need to come from NT27, and the second from NT19.\n\nLooking at the string's first symbol is t66, but NT27 can't directly produce t66. So perhaps this is not the correct split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first split is different.\n\nLet me try another possibility. Suppose NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7.\n\nThen, the first part is NT17, which can produce 't66' (as per the rule NT17 \u2192 't66'), and the second part is NT7.\n\nSo, the first part of the string would be t66. Then the remaining string would be t25, t71, ... and so on.\n\nWait, that might fit. Let me see:\n\nIf S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7, then the initial split is:\n\n[NT17] [NT7] [NT34]\n\nBut wait, NT34 is a non-terminal, which can split into others.

{"custom_id":"request-221","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t43 t77 t20 t40 t71 t54 t18 t14 t65 t41 t22 t29`. Let me start by understanding what the grammar and the string represent.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier because in CNF, the left-hand side of each rule is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side can be up to two terminals or non-terminals. In this case, the rules seem to be only involving non-terminals except for the terminals assigned to various symbols like 't3', 't14', etc.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t43, t77, t20, etc. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S expands to two parts: NT6 and NT34. Each of these needs to expand further until we get down to terminals.\n\nLet me map the grammar rules to the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the string: t43 t77 t20 t40 t71 t54 t18 t14 t65 t41 t22 t29.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to work backwards, starting from the end of the string or see how each part can be broken down using the grammar.\n\nLet's start from S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first expansion of S is two parts: NT6 and NT34. So the string will be built by concatenating the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nNow, looking at NT6 in the grammar: from the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 again, and also NT6 has some rules where it's directly assigned terminals like 't20' via NT6 \u2192 't20'. Similarly, we have more rules for NT6.\n\nWait, looking at the NT6 rules, one of them is NT6 \u2192 't20', which is a terminal. So if NT6 can directly produce t20, that would be a possible node in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the third word is t20. So maybe NT6 produces t20, which would correspond to that position.\n\nThen, the other part of S is NT34 \u2192 NT33 NT17 and NT34 is assigned to 't3'. Wait, no, let me check the grammar rules for NT34. I see NT34 \u2192 't3'. So NT34 can produce the terminal t3. But in the string, t34 is not present; let me check the string again.\n\nWait, the string is: t43, t77, t20, t40, t71, t54, t18, t14, t65, t41, t22, t29.\n\nWait, that's 12 terms. Let me map each term to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are things like t3, t14, t20, t27, etc. So each of these in the string should correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, for S \u2192 NT6 NT34. If NT6 is t20 and NT34 is t3. Then the string S would be t20 t3, but our string is longer, so that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the expansions happen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire string is generated by S through a series of productions, so each step splits non-terminals into smaller parts until terminals are reached.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Now, I need to see what NT6 and NT34 can expand into.\n\nLooking at NT6, it has several rules. For example, NT6 can expand into:\n\n- NT27 NT19\n- NT33 NT19\n- NT21 NT25\n- NT31 NT17\n- and several others, but some specific rules include NT6 \u2192 't20'.\n\nBut let's see the string. The first term is t43. Maybe the overall expansion starts somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me map each symbol in the string to the grammar's terminals.\n\nLooking at all the terminals in the grammar:\n\nt3, t14, t20, t27, t40, t41, t54, t65, t71, t77, t72, t43, t53, t10 (wait, 't10' is a terminal?), t11, t18, t22, t29, t66, t73, t80, t81, etc.\n\nIn the string, the first three terms are t43, t77, t20.\n\nLooking up each in the grammar:\n\n- t43 is assigned to NT34?\nWait no, in the grammar rules, I see NT19 \u2192 't47', which is different. Wait, let's list all terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT2\u2192 't28'\n\nNT6\u2192 't20'\n\nNT1\u2192 't61'\n\nNT7\u2192 't66'\n\nNT7 also\u2192 't73'\n\nNT6\u2192 't80'\n\nWait, let me go through each rule that ends with a terminal:\n\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n\nWait no, looking through:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't37'\n\nNT0 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT17 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't80'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't57'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't84'\n\nNT31 \u2192 't43'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't40'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't67'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't18'\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT2 \u2192 't37'\n\nHmm, so the string terms are t43, t77, t20, t40, t71, t54, t18, t14, t65, t41, t22, t29.\n\nWait, let me check for each term in the string:\n\nt43: In the grammar, NT31 \u2192 't43' yes.\n\nt77: In the grammar, NT14 \u2192 't72'? Wait, looking for 't77', perhaps NT7. NT7\u2192 't73'? Wait, I might have a mistake. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT7 is assigned to 't66' and 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, NT27 has two rules: NT27 \u2192 't72' and NT27 \u2192 't73'.\n\nWait, perhaps the string term t77 corresponds to NT14? Because NT14 is assigned to 't72' and 't73'? But in the string, we have t77. So maybe that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list all the terminals in the grammar and their corresponding NTs:\n\n- t3: NT34\n\n- t14: NT15, NT24, NT31 (look at all NT rules)\n\nWait, this approach might get too tangled. Alternatively, maybe each term in the string should correspond to a terminal in the grammar. So let's map:\n\n- t43: NT31 \u2192 't43'\n\n- t77: Looking through the rules, which NT gives t77? Let's check:\n\nLooking for 't77' in all the rules, for each NT:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, perhaps it's another NT. Wait, I'm seeing in the given rules:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\n\nWait, no NT is assigned 't77' in the rules provided. Hmmm, that's a problem. Because in the string, we have t77, but looking through all the grammar rules, none of the NTs produce 't77' except for NT14 which is 't72' and 't73'.\n\nWait, but in the initial provided grammar rules, NT14 \u2192 't72', and '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I notice that most non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals and sometimes terminals, but some have two terminals as options, like NT10 \u2192 't77'. However, in CNF, you can't have two terminals in a single production, so I think there might be a mistake here. But maybe it's intentional. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, some NTs produce two terminals, like NT10 \u2192 't77' and NT19 \u2192 't47', which is allowed because in CNF, the non-terminals can produce two terminals, but the overall grammar has to be structured such that each production leads towards terminals.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must be of the form A\u2192BC or A\u2192a, where a is a single terminal. So if a non-terminal produces two terminals, like NT10 \u2192 't77', that's actually a single terminal, right? So maybe some of these lines have two terminals? Wait, looking at NT10 \u2192 't77' and NT10 \u2192 't12', that can't be because NT10 can produce two different terminals, which might mean it's an error. But perhaps the grammar is structured such that some non-terminals produce two different terminals, which would be allowed if they can generate the required string.\n\nWait no, in CNF, a production can have at most one terminal on the right side. So maybe the lines in the grammar where a non-terminal produces two letters are actually typos, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals produce a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but that's not allowed in CNF. Hmm, perhaps I should check the grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some lines have two non-terminals on the right, which is fine, but some have two terminals. For example, NT10 \u2192 't77' and NT10 \u2192 't12'. But wait, in CNF, each production can only have two symbols at most, but they can be terminals or non-terminals. So a production like NT10 \u2192 't77' would mean NT10 directly generates 't77', but 't77' is a terminal, right? Wait, no, in the string, we have 't77', but the grammar has NT10 \u2192 't77' and NT10 \u2192 't12'. So perhaps in the string, each symbol like 't66' is a terminal, meaning NT0 produces 't66', NT27 produces 't72', etc.\n\nSo the string is: t66 t3 t68 t53 t81 t36 t52 t65 t29 t57 t61 t52 t40. Let's parse this string into the sequence of symbols: t66, t3, t68, t53, t81, t36, t52, t65, t29, t57, t61, t52, t40.\n\nNow, I need to see if the grammar can derive this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step adds exactly one symbol to the left-hand side, so the derivation tree will be such that the string length is equal to the number of steps taken, starting from S.\n\nThe string has 13 symbols, so the derivation would need to involve 12 productions starting from S. But let's see if the grammar can produce it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S is split into NT6 and NT34, each of which must be expanded into the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet's break down the string into two parts possibly matching NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t66. Which NT produces t66? Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the NT definitions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66' (directly)\n- Also, looking for other NTs that might produce t66 through a chain.\n\nSo the first symbol is t66, which is direct from NT0. But NT6 could also produce t66 via some other path, but perhaps more likely, the string starts with NT6 \u2192 something that starts with t66.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t66. So in the leftmost derivation, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the first symbol would come from NT6. So let's see if NT6 can produce a t66 as part of a larger string.\n\nLooking at NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (same as above)\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7 (same as above)\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 't27' (Wait, looking back, no. The production for NT6 includes a 't27' and another term? No, looking at the grammar again:\n\nWait, let me recheck the grammar. For NT6, the productions are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n\nWait, in the provided grammar:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT17\n\nNo, NT6 doesn't directly produce 't27', 't33', etc. Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT6 with NT27. Looking back, the lines in the grammar are:\n\n- Looking for NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n\nWait, but I don't see any production like NT6 \u2192 't27', but in the grammar, NT27 \u2192 't72' and NT27 \u2192 't7' (from NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't73'). Wait, but looking back, I think I might be misunderstanding the grammar. Let me parse it correctly.\n\nEach production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals (A\u2192BC) or a non-terminal splitting into a terminal and a non-terminal (A\u2192aB) or a terminal followed by a non-terminal (A\u2192Ba) or both (A\u2192aB, A\u2192Ba, A\u2192a). So, looking at the NT6 productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19: So NT6 produces NT27 and NT19.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19: So NT6 produces NT33 and NT19.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25: So NT6 produces NT21 and NT25.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7: So NT6 produces NT27 and NT7.\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17: So NT6 produces NT33 and NT17.\n\nNone of these directly produce terminals. So to get a 't' symbol, it must come from a non-terminal that eventually derives a single terminal symbol. For example, NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't73'\n\nSo NT7 can be split into two, but also directly produce 't66' or 't73'.\n\nGiven that, if NT6 must produce a string that starts with t66, we need to see if the expansion of NT6 can lead to t66 as the first symbol. But looking at the NT6 productions, all of them involve splitting into two non-terminals, and none directly produce a terminal. Therefore, the first symbol must come from another production down the line.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t66, which comes from NT0. That seems conflicting because in the initial step, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which would produce at least two non-terminals, and the first symbol of the string comes from NT6, which, as per the grammar, splits into non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-245","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t66 t84 t14 t61 t29 t53 t43 t43 t81 t29 t10 t53 t47`, and the grammar has several productions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It consists of a series of rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT14, etc.) is rewritten into two other non-terminals. The goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these production rules repeatedly.\n\nI notice that the string starts with `t66`, so I should check if any of the rules lead to `t66` eventually. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT10 -> 't66' and NT17 -> 't66'. So, any rule that can derive NT10 or NT17 will eventually produce `t66`.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it's rewritten as NT6 NT34. So the string derived from S must have two segments, each starting with NT6 and NT34 respectively. Therefore, the string should consist of two parts separated by a space, each part corresponding to the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, the input string is `t66 t84 t14 t61 t29 t53 t43 t43 t81 t29 t10 t53 t47`. Let me split this into two parts at the first space to see if both parts start with `t66` or `t84` appropriately.\n\nThe first token is `t66`, which means the first part must be generated by NT6. The second part starts with `t84`. Let me check how NT34 is rewritten. Looking through the grammar, NT34 -> 't3'. So any NT34 will produce `t3`. However, the string after the first token starts with `t84`, which suggests that the second part is from NT2. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the start symbol S is NT6 NT34, so the expansion must be such that the first part is derived from NT6 and the second from NT34. So the first part should start with the symbols derived from NT6, and the second part from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is `t66`. That could come from NT10 or NT17. Let me see how NT10 is rewritten: NT10 -> 't66'. Similarly, NT17 -> 't66'. So if I can derive NT10 or NT17 from NT6, that part would produce `t66`.\n\nLooking at NT6: the productions for NT6 are:\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT25 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT31 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT19 -> 't47'\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT17\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should find a path from NT6 to `t66`. Let's see:\n\nFrom NT6, perhaps we can derive to NT14. Looking at NT14, it's rewritten as NT2 NT1. So NT14 -> NT2 NT1. NT2's production is NT0 and NT20, so NT2 -> NT0 NT20. Wait, but NT0 -> 't66' is one of its productions, so if NT2 includes NT0, it would produce `t66`. But wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to backtrack from the start. Let's see if S can produce the given string.\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nSo the string should be something like [NT6 derivation] [NT34 derivation]. Given that NT34 -> 't3', the second part must derive to `t3`. Looking at the string, the second part after the first token is `t84 t14 t61 t29 t53 t43 t43 t81 t29 t10 t53 t47`. But wait, the second part starts with `t84`, which is not `t3`. That suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the structure. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nLooking back, S -> NT6 NT34. So the derivation of S would result in two parts: one from NT6 and the other from NT34. So the entire string should be a concatenation of two parts, each part being the expansion of NT6 and NT34 respectively.\n\nBut in the given string, it's a series of `t` tokens separated by spaces. So maybe each `t` is a step in the derivation, but each `t` is actually a production rule application. Wait, no, each `t` seems to be a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce terminal symbols. For example, NT10 -> 't66', NT17 -> 't66', NT6 -> 't66', etc. So each non-terminal can produce a specific terminal or other non-terminals.\n\nSo the string we have is a sequence of terminals, each being one of these 't' followed by a number. So the string is: t66, t84, t14, t61, t29, t53, t43, t43, t81, t29, t10, t53, t47.\n\nSo the overall idea is to see if the start symbol S can derive this string. Let me try to see how that might happen.\n\nFirst, S is NT6 NT34. So the first part of the string (from NT6) should be t66, t84, t14, t61, t29, t53, t43, t43, t81, t29, t10, t53, which is 12 tokens. The second part (from NT34) is t47. Wait, but in the string, after the first 13 tokens, the last token is t47, so maybe the second part is just t47. Let me count: the first part is 12 tokens, the second part is 1 token, making the total 13 tokens. The given string has 13 tokens, yes.\n\nSo, the first part must come from NT6, and the second part from NT34.\n\nNow, let's focus on NT6's expansion. The first token in the first part is t66. So NT6 must derive a string that starts with t66. Looking at NT6's productions, I see that some of them include t20, t73, etc. Wait, but also, some produce t66 directly:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT10 -> 't66' ( productions )\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n\nBut NT6 has multiple productions. One is NT6 -> NT27 NT19. So to get from NT6 to t66, perhaps it's through NT27 or other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a possible derivation step by step.\n\nGiven that the first part of the string is:\n\nt66 t84 t14 t61 t29 t53 t43 t43 t81 t29 t10 t53\n\nWhich is 12 tokens. Let's see:\n\nt66 comes from NT6. How? Looking at NT6, perhaps NT6 can derive to NT10, which then becomes t66. Or maybe through another path.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think step by step. Let me try to see the possible paths.\n\nStarting with NT6, one of the rules is NT6 -> NT33 NT19.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 can be broken down into NT27 NT19 or other options.\n\nWait, maybe I can map the given string in reverse, seeing how each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for sequences that match the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the first token, t66, which could come from NT10 or NT17.\n\nIf t66 is from NT10, then looking at NT10's production: NT10 -> 't66', so that's one step. But then, how do we get the rest of the tokens from there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe t66 is produced through a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the tokens in the string are the result of a series of productions applied step by step. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-268","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t50 t38 t71 t23 t40 t18 t52 t47 t49 t36 t12 t65 t71 t54`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how Chomsky normal form (CNF) works. CNF requires that each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the grammar can have a start symbol S from which the entire string is derived.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see that it's a set of production rules. Each production starts with a single non-terminal and expands into two non-terminals or terminals. Some of the productions end with terminals like 't50', 't38', etc. \n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think the approach is to work backwards: starting with the string and see if I can reduce it step by step until I get to the start symbol S. For each token in the string, I need to find a production that matches it and then replace it with the non-terminals in the production, continuing this process until everything is reduced to S.\n\nThe string has 14 tokens, so I'll process them one by one, perhaps starting from the left or right, but working from the outermost terminals towards the center, trying to find possible substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol and see if it can generate the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree where each node is a production rule.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps I should take:\n\n1. **Identify Productions for Each Terminal**: For each terminal in the string, find corresponding production rules. If a terminal has multiple productions, I might have multiple options to choose from.\n\n2. **Build a Reduction Tree**: Starting from the left or right, replace each terminal or substring with the non-terminals from their productions and see if the resulting string can still be reduced.\n\n3. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that the reductions are consistent and lead to the initial symbol S without contradictions.\n\nGiven that this is a time-consuming process, especially with 14 tokens, I'll need to keep track of each substitution carefully. \n\nI should also note that some terminals in the string are repeated, like 't54' and 't71', which might complicate things. I'll need to check if these terminals have productions that are compatible with the surrounding terms.\n\nLet me try to find where each terminal comes from. For example, let's take the first token 't50'. Looking through the grammar, the production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. NT6 can produce 't52' and 't66', and NT34 can produce 't3'. So from S, we get 't52 t3' if we expand NT6 and NT34 as terminals.\n\nBut the string starts with 't50', which isn't directly produced by any initial production. Therefore, perhaps there are non-terminals that lead to 't50' through their productions. For instance, looking at the grammar, I see that NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17, and NT31 can produce 't43' or other terms. Let me check NT33's productions.\n\nWait, NT33 is defined as NT31 NT17. NT31 has productions like NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0, which could lead to 't43' and 't66' respectively. NT17 could produce 't66' or 't66' again. Hmm, NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT7, which then leads to 't66' or 't66', perhaps leading to 't66 t66' for NT17. So, combining that with NT31, maybe NT33 could produce 't43 t66'. But the string has 't50' first, so that might not align.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's consider each token in the string and see if any of them can be directly derived from a non-terminal. If a terminal can't be derived from a single non-terminal, perhaps it's part of a larger production that hasn't been expanded yet.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for the longest possible match in the string and see if that can be derived from a single production. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be built by expanding the start symbol S according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to start from the beginning:\n\n- The string starts with 't50'. Let's look at the grammar to see which non-terminals produce 't50'. Looking through the production rules, I don't see any production that directly gives 't50' as a terminal. So perhaps 't50' is the result of expanding a non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, which non-terminals can derive 't50' as a terminal? Scanning the productions, I don't see any direct rules, but maybe it's part of a larger production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. The grammar is in CNF, which only allows two non-terminals per production, or a terminal. So 't50' must be a result of expanding a single non-terminal's production that includes 't50' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't3' (from the given, though I need to check all rules)\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3' (from NT33 \u2192 ... and NT34 \u2192 't3'.)\n\nWait, looking at the initial part:\n\nYes, the user provided a list of productions, each line seems to be a production with the non-terminal on the left and the right side (terminals and non-terminals) on the right.\n\nSo, for example, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nThen NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0.\n\nSo on and so forth. So some of these non-terminals (like NT34) can derive terminals directly. So, for example, if NT34 has a production like NT34 \u2192 't3', then 't3' is part of the generated string via NT34.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19, for example. Also, some non-terminals like NT34 are directly linked to terminals.\n\nIn the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT19 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, so if NT19 \u2192 't47', then NT6 can eventually produce 't47' when that production is expanded.

Looking at the given grammar, all productions seem to fit CNF, with non-terminals on the left and terminals or two non-terminals on the right. \n\nThe string provided is `t29 t22 t66 t20 t47 t52 t55 t20 t84 t80 t18 t49 t49 t68`. So each segment is a token, which could correspond to either terminals or parts of the grammar's productions.\n\nSince it's a CNF grammar, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. To parse a string, it's often efficient to use a method like recursive parsing or a pushdown automaton, but given the string length, a recursive approach might get complicated. Alternatively, we can try to see if each token in the string can be derived by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string for clarity:\n1. t29\n2. t22\n3. t66\n4. t20\n5. t47\n6. t52\n7. t55\n8. t20\n9. t84\n10. t80\n11. t18\n12. t49\n13. t49\n14. t68\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are several non-terminals that produce 't' terms. For instance, NT6 \u2192 't20', NT1 \u2192 't61', etc. So each 't' token is a result of a production.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down into the productions. It's a bit challenging, but perhaps I can start from the beginning.\n\n1. The first symbol is t29. Looking at the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 t20, but t29 isn't directly produced by any production I can see. Wait, looking again, I see NT21 \u2192 t29, and NT4 \u2192 t29 via NT1. So either NT21 or NT4 can produce t29.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 \u2192 t37 and NT21 also \u2192 t29. Hmm, no, looking at the list: \"NT21 -> 't37'\" and \"NT1 -> 't29'\". Also, NT4 -> 't39' and \"NT21 -> 't29'\". Hmm, but in the string, the first token is t29. So perhaps the starting symbol S must derive this t29 as the first symbol.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So starting with NT6, then NT34.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So NT6 will produce something that starts with the first symbol. Let's see what NT6 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6 productions: There are a few entries, like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, etc. But directly, does NT6 produce t29? Checking the productions, I don't see NT6 \u2192 't29', but wait, there's NT1 \u2192 't29', and NT21 \u2192 't29'. So perhaps NT27 or NT21 can produce t29.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. Each non-terminal can produce a terminal or other non-terminals. So the first symbol is t29, which could come from NT21 or NT1. Let's assume it's NT21.\n\nSo if NT21 produces t29, then the first part of S's expansion would be NT21. Then NT34 must produce the rest. Wait, but S is NT6 and NT34, so each of these non-terminals must be expanded. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo first, NT6 is expanded, then NT34 is expanded, and the string is the concatenation of their expansions.\n\nSo, starting with NT6. Let's see what NT6 can produce. In the grammar, NT6 has several productions, including NT6 \u2192 't6' but that's not a terminal. Wait, no, checking the grammar list: actually, I don't see a production for NT6 directly producing t29. Instead, looking for NT21 and NT4, which do. Hmm, perhaps I need to trace back how NT21 can be derived from NT6.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for how t29 can be generated. Let's see, t29 is derived from NT1 or NT21.\n\nBut in S, it's starting with NT6 and NT34. So I need to see how NT6 produces t29, which might require multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to model the entire string as a series of productions. The string is a series of terminals, each of which must be produced by some non-terminal, and the structure must correspond to the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: The string is 14 tokens long. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step doubles the number of symbols, so the number of steps for a string of length n is log2(n). However, this string has 14 terms, which is a bit awkward, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, the initial expansion of S would produce two non-terminals (each production from S has two parts). Then each of those could be expanded recursively. So the expansion tree would have a height corresponding to the number of steps needed to reach leaves (terminals).\n\nAlternatively, since each rule in the grammar is either a terminal or two non-terminals, the length of the string must be (2^k), where k is the number of expansion steps from S. So for a string of length 14, it's not a power of two, since 2^4=16, which is bigger than 14, and 2^3=8, which is smaller. So either the string is invalid or I made a mistake. Wait, let's check the string again.\n\nString: t29 t22 t66 t20 t47 t52 t55 t20 t84 t80 t18 t49 t49 t68\n\nThat's 14 tokens. Hmm, so 14 is not a power of two. Wait, but in CNF, each production is a single rule to two symbols. So the number of terminals in the string must be 2^k, where k is the number of steps. So 14 isn't a power of two, so that suggests the string isn't possible. But wait, maybe I'm wrong because the grammar has some terminals that are single characters? No, in CNF, every production is to two non-terminals or a terminal, so all terminals are atomic and the string length must match 2^(k). So 14 can't be written as 2^k because 2^3=8 and 2^4=16. Thus 14 is not possible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by any grammar in CNF.\n\nWait, but wait, is the initial symbol S allowed to produce the string directly? No, because S is an uppercase non-terminal, but in the string, the first symbol is a terminal, so S must derive into a series of terminals and non-terminals whose concatenation matches the string. But if the string length isn't a power of two, it's impossible.\n\nSo, regardless of the grammar, any string generated by a CNF grammar must have a length that's a power of two. Since 14 isn't a power of two, the string cannot be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it's in the language defined by this grammar. The string is: `t50 t38 t71 t57 t71 t29 t52 t14 t35 t73 t49 t45 t52 t12 t65`. That's quite a long string, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal or terminal symbols. This form is useful because it simplifies the parsing process, and algorithms like CYK can be applied. However, since I'm not planning to parse the string, I'll instead find another way to determine if the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to reverse-engineer the derivation starting from the start symbol and see if the string can be broken down according to the given rules. The start symbol in CNF is usually the only non-terminal on the left side, but in this case, looking at the grammar, the production for S is `S -> NT6 NT34`. So S is the start symbol, and the initial step would be to see if the string can be generated from S by expanding S and its immediate productions.\n\nBut before diving into the entire string, I'll check if the string starts with any terminals that appear directly in the RHS of any production. Let me look through the productions to see which NTs map to terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice that several NTs map directly to specific tokens (like 't12', 't14', etc.). For example:\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT21 -> 't37'\n- NT22 -> 't77'\n- NT24 -> 't14'\n- NT31 -> 't43'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT25 -> 't49'\n- NT27 -> 't72' or 't66'\n- NT14 -> 't72'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't66' or 't73'\n- And others.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t50`. Hmm, looking through the productions, I don't see any production that directly produces 't50'. That could be a problem because if the first symbol in the string isn't produced directly by any non-terminal, then the string can't be derived, right?\n\nLet me check all the productions to see who produces 't50'. Looking through the RHS of all non-terminals, 't50' doesn't appear as a terminal. So none of the NTs directly produce 't50'. That means the string can't be derived from the start symbol S because the first step would require a non-terminal that can produce 't50', which doesn't exist.\n\nBut wait, maybe someone produces something else that can eventually produce 't50', but given that 't50' isn't directly a terminal in any production, and none of the rules have 't50' on the RHS, it's impossible. So if the first token is 't50', the string cannot be in the language.\n\nWait, but looking again, no, 't50' doesn't appear as a terminal symbol in any production. Let me double-check the provided productions:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any rule where the RHS is 't50'. The closest is maybe the production NT34 -> 't3', and NT22 -> 't38', but nothing for 't50'.

The string is \"t43 t14 t47 t54 t35 t84 t84 t23 t41 t52 t50 t28 t14 t66 t11 t52\". I need to determine whether this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided seems to be written in CNF because all rules start with a non-terminal on the left and have either two non-terminals or a single terminal on the right.\n\nThe string provided consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if these terminals can be derived through a sequence of productions from the start symbol S. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals through productions. For example, NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, and so on. So, the approach might be to work backwards from the string, trying to split the string into possible non-terminal productions and see if such splits exist in the grammar.\n\nSince the string is long, I'll try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can parse the string by trying to match it from left to right, using the grammar rules to see if each part can be matched successively.\n\nLet me write down the string to parse:\n\nt43 t14 t47 t54 t35 t84 t84 t23 t41 t52 t50 t28 t14 t66 t11 t52\n\nFirst, the string starts with t43. I need to see if there's a production that results in t43. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT rules that produce t43. Wait, scanning the NT rules, I see that NT10 \u2192 't84', but nothing else seems to produce t43. Wait, actually, checking the grammar, I see that NT0 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't66' as well, but no rule for t43. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I read that correctly?

Let's see the terminals:\n\nLooking for 't43', I see in the grammar that NT24 appears elsewhere, but nothing directly. Wait, in the grammar, NT24 \u2192 't14' and 't53'. So, NT24 can produce t14 or t53. Hmm, but we're looking for 't43'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check each rule systematically. Let me list all the symbols and see which NTs produce which terminals.\n\nWait, from the grammar:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't12' and 't84' (from NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31 and then further splits)\nWait, in the rules, NT10 is defined as:\n\nNT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31, and then NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, and so on. So it seems NT10 can derive various terminal strings, but looking at the string provided, the first symbol is 't43', which isn't directly derived from NT10.\n\nWait, so maybe 't43' is from some other NT. Let me see:\n\nLooking through all the NT definitions, the terminals produced by each:\n\n- NT10: t12, t84\n- NT11: t54, t67\n- NT14: t72\n- NT15: t65\n- NT17: t66 (twice, perhaps)\n- NT18: t22\n- NT2: t28\n- NT21: t37, t81\n- NT22: t77, t10, t25, t38\n- NT24: t14, t53\n- NT25: t49, t57\n- NT27: t77, t80, t66\n- NT31: t43 (I think?), as NT31 \u2192 ...

Let me make sure.\n\nWait, the rules under NT31 are:\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\nNT31 -> NT22 NT17\n\nWait, no, looking back at the user's grammar, I see:\n\nNT31 is defined as:\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\nNT31 -> NT22 NT17\n\nWait, that can't be correct because in one of the rules, it's NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17, and another is NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT17. So, wait, that would mean that NT31 can produce both NT17 and NT22. But wait, no, looking carefully, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the user's input, the rules for NT31 are:\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\nNT17 -> 't66'\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me parse the user's grammar carefully:\n\nFor NT31, the rules are:\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\nNT31 -> NT22 NT17\n\nWait, is that correct? Because in the user's input, it's written as:\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\n\nNT31 -> NT22 NT17\n\nSo, each of these is a separate production.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, or a terminal.

Let's start by looking at the start rule.\n\nLooking at the top-level rule, S -> NT6 NT34. So each of these must derive to a string of terminals. So I'll need to see if NT6 can derive to t68 and NT34 can derive to the rest, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no, actually, NT6 and NT34 are both non-terminals, so they each derive to a string of terminals. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the two strings derived by NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t68, t81, etc., so perhaps NT6 is responsible for the first part, and NT34 for the latter.\n\nLet me look at the possible productions for NT6 and NT34.\n\nStarting with NT6:\n\nNT6 appears in several productions, for example:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT31 NT19\nNT6 -> NT22 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT10 NT25\nSo several paths.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 is the other part of S. Let's see NT34's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT34 appears as:\nNT34 -> NT31 NT17\nNT34 -> something else?

Let me check all productions for NT34.\n\nFrom the list:\n\nNT34 -> NT31 NT17\nAnd that's it? Yes, only one production. So NT34 must derive to \"t3\" followed by \"t55\", because looking at the grammar, what does NT34 derive to? Wait, wait, I need to check all terminals under NT34. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should build a parse tree or use some method like leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down into the two parts from NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, but the string is one long string, so perhaps I should split it into two parts where one part starts with t68... and the other starts with t81..., etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model how NT6 and NT34 can produce their respective parts.\n\nLet's start with NT34 since it has only one production: NT34 -> NT31 NT17, which then must derive to NT31 and NT17. Looking at the NT31 production:\n\nNT31 has multiple productions, including some that lead to terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has several NT31 productions leading to terminals, like:\n\nNT31 -> NT22 NT0\nNT31 -> NT27 NT19\nNT31 -> NT28 NT20\nNT31 -> NT6 NT19\nNT31 -> NT20 NT11\nWait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see multiple rules for NT31 with terminals:\n\nFor example, NT31 -> NT31 NT17 (which is a recursive rule), but also other rules have terminals, like:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7 (which would lead to t77 if both 7s are resolved)\nNT15 -> NT7 NT4\nNT4 -> 't29'\nNT6 -> 't66'\nWait, actually, many of the rules in the grammar directly map to terminals, which makes it easier.\n\nWait, for example, looking at the NT6 productions, some have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, NT6 -> 't20', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, no, wait: Looking again, the grammar seems to have some non-terminals being terminals. For example, when I look at the provided rules, for example:\n\nNT10 -> 't12'\nNT1 -> 't14'\nNT6 -> 't20'\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps many of these non-terminals have direct terminal assignments. So that can help in building the string.\n\nSo, for example, NT6 can either be broken down further or it can be a terminal (t20). Similarly, others.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I can try to match it against the start symbols.\n\nLet's see: The string is \"t68 t81 t55 t67 t22 t35 t50 t18 t50 t37 t10 t68 t57 t23 t50 t30\".\n\nWe need to split this into two parts: the part derived from NT6 and the part derived from NT34.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 starts with t68, so let's see what NT6 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nOne of the productions is NT6 -> 't68' directly, as per the grammar? Wait, no, in the provided rules, I don't see NT6 -> 't68'. Wait, let me look again.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT6 directly mapping to t68. The rules seem to have NT6 mapping to various other NTs. Hmm. So perhaps I need to see the entire parse.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to start with NT34, which seems to produce \"t31 t17\". So, does the string after t68... start with t81, which could correspond to something derived from NT34.\n\nWait, let me try this:\n\nThe entire string can be viewed as S deriving to NT6 and NT34, each producing a substring.\n\nSo, NT6 would derive to t68 followed by something, and NT34 would derive to the rest.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT34's production, it's only NT31 NT17. So NT34 must be a two-step process.\n\nWait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should approach this by trying to split the string and see if each part matches the possible derivations.\n\nWait, the string starts with t68. Let's look for all possible NT6 productions that can derive to t68.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19: So t27 followed by t19, which might not match t68.\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19: t33 followed by t19, which would be different.\n- NT6 -> NT31 NT19: t31 followed by t19, which is different from t68.\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT25: Recursive, seems unlikely to be the starting point.\n- NT6 -> NT22 NT25: t22 followed by t25, which would produce \"t22 t25\".\nWait, but I'm looking for t68 at the beginning, so perhaps none of the NT6 direct productions are t68. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait. Let me check the grammar again for any NT that can produce 't68' directly.

The string is: `t39 t43 t23 t22 t38 t67 t25 t23 t39 t66 t67 t39 t72 t73 t65 t10 t67`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either terminals or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven that it's a context-free grammar, I need to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first two symbols in the string must be derived from NT6 and NT34, respectively. However, the first two tokens are t39 and t43. I need to check which non-terminals these tokens correspond to.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- For NT6, the productions are:\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT19 NT19\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (duplicate)\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (duplicate)\n  - NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7 (duplicate)\n  - etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me list all NT6 productions correctly:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (since NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, but wait, looking at the provided list, I can see:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT6 has the following productions:\n1.

NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (duplicate)\n9. NT6 \u2192 NT26 NT7? Wait, no, looking back, perhaps I miscounted. Wait, let me list all NT6 rules correctly from the provided grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has the following productions (excluding redundant ones listed multiple times):\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (again)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17 (again)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (again)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (again)\n- So, probably, unique productions are five:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n\nSo, the first token is t39, which needs to be matched by a terminal. So, for NT6, the right-hand sides produce terminals when the non-terminals on the RHS produce terminal strings.\n\nLet me check which of the RHS of NT6 can derive a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT27: \nFrom the grammar, NT27 can produce:\n- NT7 NT7\n- NT6 NT37\n- NT26 NT7? No, looking at the grammar, NT27 is defined as:\n\"NT27 NT19\" no, wait, looking at the given grammar, NT27 has rules:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 NT6 NT37\nNo, wait:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT27 is defined as:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 NT6 NT37\nWait, not sure, let me check again.\n\nWait, the full grammar is:\nNT27 NT7 \u2192 NT77\nNT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11\nNT29 \u2192 NT14 NT28\n...\nWait, perhaps it's better to look up NT27.\n\nIn the given grammar:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 NT6 NT37\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided CFG:\n\nLooking for NT27:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT27 \u2192 NT6 NT37\n- Wait, but in the provided grammar, it's written as \"NT27 NT19\" no. Let me parse the grammar carefully.\n\nThe grammar has lines like:\n\"NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\" and \"NT27 \u2192 NT6 NT37\". So, NT27 can produce either NT7 NT7 or NT6 NT37.\n\nNow, NT7 has production:\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'.\n\nSo, if NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, then both RHS symbols are NT7, each can produce t66 or t73.\n\nWait, but that's for NT27, but in the first step, we have NT6 in the production, which is being used to produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting tangled. Let me approach this more methodically.\n\nThe string starts with t39 t43 t23 t22 t38 t67 t25 t23 t39 t66 t67 t39 t72 t73 t65 t10 t67.\n\nSo, the sequence is 17 tokens.\n\nLet me try to parse this string step by step, starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with NT6 and NT34 derived.\n\nThe first token is t39. So, NT6 must derive a string that starts with t39. But NT6 can only produce terminals when all non-terminals in the RHS are eventually replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, actually, in the context of the grammar, the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the entire string must be the concatenation of NT6 and NT34 derived strings.\n\nBut the string is t39 followed by t43. So, the first symbols are t39 and t43, which should be the start of NT6's production and NT34's production, respectively.\n\nWait, no. The derivation starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, during the parse, the entire string is the concatenation of the NT6-derived string and the NT34-derived string.\n\nSo, for the string to be valid, it should be possible to split the string into two parts: the first part derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nSplit into two parts where NT6's derivation ends and NT34's starts. But since both NT6 and NT34 can produce multiple symbols, it's not obvious where the split happens.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find a path from S to the entire string.\n\nLet me attempt to see what NT34 can produce. Checking the grammar for NT34:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT34 is defined by:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT34 \u2192 NT14 NT34\nWait, but I think the grammar has:\n\nFrom the provided lines:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT34 \u2192 NT14 NT34\n\nWait, no, actually, looking back at the given grammar, NT34 is defined as:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT4\nNT34 \u2192 NT14 NT34\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, looking at the terminals for NT34, we can see that NT34 produces 't34' when applicable. Wait, no, 't34' is a terminal in the string, but is that part of NT34?\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I don't see any production for NT34 that results in a terminal, except perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check. The productions for NT34 in the grammar are:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT34 \u2192 NT14 NT34\n- Also, maybe I'm missing some, but none of these result in terminals. So, NT34 is a non-terminal that can only produce other non-terminals,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-327","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at the grammar rules provided. CNF grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two terminals or two non-terminals. All non-terminals must be in the left-hand side (LHS) of a production rule. This is important because it affects how the string can be derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the LHS are all the NT... symbols, like S, NT14, NT20, etc. And each of these can produce combinations of terminals or other non-terminals. The string I'm given is `t36 t53 t72 t43 t80 t41 t65 t61 t23 t54 t68 t67 t37 t47 t40 t0 t50`. \n\nI know that in CNF, the derivation tree is binary, meaning each step splits a non-terminal into two parts. The string should correspond to such a binary tree. Each 't' token is a terminal, which must match exactly the right-hand side (RHS) of some production rule.\n\nI should note that many of the non-terminals have direct productions to terminals. For example, NT14 -> 't72', NT7 -> 't66' or 't73', etc. So, when looking at the string, each 't' must be matched by some production. Also, non-terminals can be further split into more non-terminals, eventually leading down to the terminals.\n\nNow, let's parse the string step by step. I'll list the string as a series of tokens to process:\n\nt36, t53, t72, t43, t80, t41, t65, t61, t23, t54, t68, t67, t37, t47, t40, t0, t50.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to construct the derivation starting from the start symbol S. S is defined as NT6 NT34 (S -> NT6 NT34). So, the first step is to have the string split into two parts: the expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT34 has a production rule that includes 't3' or even further splits. Let me check: NT34 -> 't3' directly, right? But in the RHS of the production, it's written as 't17' and 't3'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar says NT33 -> NT31 NT17, but I need to check if NT34 has any productions. Wait, in the grammar, under NT34, I see NT34 -> 't3' or something else?\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I see multiple NT34 mentions. Let me re-examine each line:\n\nLooking through the productions, for NT34: I see \"NT34 -> 't3'\", \"NT34 -> 't2'?\", wait, no, actually looking more carefully: Oh, wait, under NT34, I see:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT34 -> 't41'\n- NT34 -> 't50'\nSo, NT34 can produce 't3', 't41', or 't50'. Wait, no, the entries for NT34 are:\n\n\"NT34 -> 't3'\", \"NT34 -> 't2'?\", Wait, no, looking back: in the grammar, the relevant lines are:\n\n\"NT34 -> 't3'\", \"NT34 -> 't2'...\" Wait, no, no, looking correctly:\n\nWait, in the production rules provided, under NT34:\n\n- There's \"NT34 -> 't3'\", which seems to directly produce 't3', which is the terminal symbol 't3'.\n\nBut then, under NT34, there's also NT34 -> 't17', but that can't be because it's not in the provided list. Wait, no, in the lines, NT34 only has \"NT34 -> 't3'\", but perhaps not. Let me scan through all the NT34 lines:\n\nLooking for any line with NT34 in LHS:\n\n1. NT34 -> 't3'\n2. NT24 -> 't14'\n3. NT19 -> 't23'\n4. NT22 -> 't10'\n5. NT20 -> 't45'\n6. NT17 -> 't66'\n7. NT18 -> 't22'\n8. NT10 -> 't12'\n9. NT1 -> 't61'\n10. NT6 -> 't20'\n11. NT1 -> 't29'\n12. NT27 -> 't72'\n13. NT4 -> 't29'\n14.

NT21 -> 't29'\n\nSo, for NT34, lines 1, 30, and 33:\n\n- \"NT34 -> 't3'\"\n- \"NT34 -> 't41'\"\n- \"NT34 -> 't50'\". \n\nWait, no, looking at line 30: It's \"NT34 -> 't41'\". Line 31 is \"NT6 -> 't25'\", etc.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all the NT34 rules:\n\nLooking through all the NT34 lines:\n\n1. \"NT34 -> 't3'\"\n2. \"NT24 -> 't14'\"\nWait, no, that's for NT24. Let me correct:\n\nLooking at each line, the NT34 rules are only in line 1:\n\n\"NT34 -> 't3'\"\n\nBut wait, looking again, in some other lines, e.g., line 30: \"NT34 -> 't41'\". Did I count this correctly?\n\nYes, looking back: Line 30 is \"NT34 -> 't41'\", so that's a production for NT34. So NT34 can produce 't3', 't41', or 't50'? Wait, checking line 33: \"NT34 -> 't50'\".\n\nWait, that's line 33: \"NT34 -> 't50'\". So, NT34's productions are:\n\n- 't3',\n- 't41',\n- 't50'.\n\nSo, NT34 can only produce those single terminals. Similarly, checking for other NT...\n\nSo, in the initial step, S produces NT6 and NT34. Each of these will have their own productions.\n\nSo, the entire string must come from expanding NT6 and NT34 into their respective trees, which together produce all the terms in the string.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall structure.\n\nEach call to a non-terminal must generate a subtree that results in a sequence of terminal and non-terminal nodes matching the target string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production step splits a non-terminal into two parts, which could themselves be terminals or further non-terminals. Thus, the derivation tree is a full binary tree, with the root being S, and the leaves being the terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-340","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t54 t35 t72 t49 t43 t68 t11 t66 t73 t28 t41 t66 t65 t37 t80 t12 t49 t52`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where each right-hand side (RHS) is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. The given grammar only has productions that fit this structure, so that's good.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and its production is `S -> NT6 NT34`. So any valid derivation must start with NT6 and NT34. The string starts with `t54` and ends with `t52`, so I'll need to trace from S to these tokens step by step.\n\nWait, actually, I think I should approach this by parsing the string and seeing if it can be derived from S by applying the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step either replaces a non-terminal with a single symbol or two symbols. But wait, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So I can check each symbol in the string against the grammar rules.\n\nLet me break down the string token by token and see if I can find a derivation path.\n\nThe string is:\n`t54 t35 t72 t49 t43 t68 t11 t66 t73 t28 t41 t66 t65 t37 t80 t12 t49 t52`\n\nI'll start from the beginning and try to match the symbols with the possible productions.\n\n1. The first symbol is `t54`. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that `NT15` and `NT19` produce `t53`, `t47`, etc., but `t54` isn't directly there. Wait, perhaps I need to look for productions that result in `t54`. Scanning the productions, I see that `NT11 -> 't54'` and `NT4 -> 't39'`, but not `t54`. No, wait, no production directly gives `t54`. Hmm, did I miss something? Let me check again.\n\nLooking again, I see `NT15 -> 't65'`, `NT1-> 't61'`, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the terminal symbols and see if any of the productions generate `t54`.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT11 -> 't54' (Yes, line NT11: `NT11 -> 't54'`)\n\nSo `t54` comes from NT11. Now, where does NT11 appear? NT11 has a production: `NT11 -> 't54'`. So in the grammar, NT11 is a terminal, so when we have `t54`, that's directly from NT11.\n\nSo the first token `t54` must come directly from NT11.\n\nNow, to get to `t54`, we must have NT11 in the derivation. So, where does NT11 come from? Looking back, NT11's production is only `NT11 -> 't54'`. So NT11 must have been derived from somewhere else, but since it's a direct production to a terminal, that's only possible if it's a start symbol and derived directly. Wait, but S starts with NT6 and NT34, so maybe I need to go up the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The grammar's productions consist of non-terminals on the left and other non-terminals on the RHS. So NT11 can only be a non-terminal that produces a terminal, but in this case, perhaps in the context of a larger derivation.\n\nMaybe it's easier to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet me consider how to parse the string using the given productions.\n\nStart with S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the first step is S -> NT6 NT34, which would produce two symbols. But the string starts with `t54`, which is a single token. That seems conflicting because S would split into two parts, so the string should start with two symbols. But the string is one token long, which doesn't fit. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string is given as a sequence of tokens, so each token is a leaf in the parse tree. So each terminal symbol in the string must come directly from a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, but S -> NT6 NT34 would mean the first step produces two symbols. So in the string, the first two symbols should be the first part of the derive. But our string starts with `t54`, so perhaps NT6 or NT34 must produce `t54` as one of their possible tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the string can be built by replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I can parse the string by breaking it down into possible productions.\n\nLet me try to parse the string:\n\nThe string is: t54 t35 t72 t49 t43 t68 t11 t66 t73 t28 t41 t66 t65 t37 t80 t12 t49 t52\n\nI can try to split this into parts using the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the first symbol `t54`, we saw it comes from NT11. So maybe we have NT11 in the first position.\n\nBut S starts with NT6 and NT34. Wait, that suggests that the first two symbols should be the results of NT6 and NT34. But in our string, the first symbol is a single `t54`. So perhaps NT6 or NT34 must produce this. Let's check.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6: There are several NT6 productions, for example, `NT6 -> 't20'`, `NT6 -> 't27'`, etc. But none of them directly produce `t54`. So NT6 cannot be the source of `t54`. Similarly, NT34 has productions: `NT34 -> 't3'`, `NT34 -> 't50'`, `NT34 -> 't52'`, etc. So `t54` isn't produced by NT34.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to backtrack. Perhaps the initial S production is S -> NT6 NT34, and the first part of the string doesn't start with NT6 but with something else.\n\nWait, but S must be the start symbol, so the entire string must be derived from S. Therefore, the first two symbols should come from NT6 and NT34, or maybe one of them is split further. But the string starts with a single `t54`. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the string is a single sequence of terminals, and the grammar is structured in such a way that each terminal in the string comes from a specific non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a way to parse the string using the CFG rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the recursive descent parsing method or look for the derivation steps.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps.\n\nThe string is a list of symbols: s = [t54, t35, t72, t49, t43, t68, t11, t66, t73, t28, t41, t66, t65, t37, t80, t12, t49, t52]\n\nWe can try to parse this from left to right, replacing non-terminals with their productions until all are terminals.\n\nThe first non-terminal in the derivation must be S, as S is the start symbol. S's production is S -> NT6 NT34. So during the first step, S would produce NT6 and NT34, which would then be processed further.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t54, which is a terminal. So perhaps the initial NT6 and NT34 would each generate single terminals, but since NT6 or NT34 themselves may need to split further, but the string starts with a single t54.\n\nLet me see: If S -> NT6 NT34, then the derivation would produce two terminals first. But the string is longer, so maybe the first two symbols come from NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, that's the initial step: NT6 and NT34.\n\nFor example, if NT6 -> t54 and NT34 -> t35, then the first two symbols would be t54 t35, which matches the start of the string: t54 t"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-341","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember is a form where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided. It consists of a bunch of productions starting from S. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must be derived starting with NT6 and NT34. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t47 t39 t0 t84 t72 t54 t73 t11 t81 t18 t54 t83 t40 t3 t38 t77 t22 t71`. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, during parsing, each non-terminal will split into exactly two parts, which can either be non-terminals or terminals. The process is similar to how a binary tree is built, with each node having two children until terminals are reached.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string step by step according to the grammar rules. \n\nStarting with the initial symbol S, which should derive into NT6 NT34. So the string must start with the expansion of NT6 followed by the expansion of NT34. \n\nLooking at NT6 in the grammar, let's see its productions. From the list, NT6 has several rules: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 again, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, etc. Wait, it seems like some are repeated. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 is listed twice, and similarly for NT33 and NT21 NT25. I think the key is that each production for NT6 goes to two non-terminals that need to be further expanded.\n\nNow, the first token in the string is t47. So when parsing, the first part should be NT6 \u2192 something that leads to t47. Looking at the productions for NT6, for example, NT6 can produce NT19, which then produces t47. Let's see: \n\nLooking at NT19's productions: NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21 and NT19 \u2192 NT22 NT20. Oh, and also NT19 has two rules, one of which is NT19 \u2192 't47'. Wait, looking at the given grammar, under NT19, there's a rule 't47'\u2014so actually, NT19 can be a terminal t47 directly. So one possibility for NT6 is that it produces NT19, which then immediately produces t47. \n\nSo if NT6 \u2192 NT19, and NT19 \u2192 't47', that gives us the first token t47.\n\nMoving on, after NT6, the second part is NT34. Looking at NT34, its productions are NT34 \u2192 't3' and NT34 \u2192 't38' and NT34 \u2192 't50' and others, but also NT34 can produce NT22 and NT0, where NT22 and NT0 have their own productions. \n\nWait, the string continues after t47 with t39, t0, t84, and so on. Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with the expansion of NT6 and then NT34.\n\nThe first token is t47. Let's check the possible ways to get t47. From the grammar, NT19 can produce 't47' directly. So if NT6 can produce NT19, then the first part could be NT6 \u2192 NT19 \u2192 t47.\n\nWait, but looking back, the grammar for NT19 is NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21 and NT19 \u2192 NT22 NT20 and also NT19 \u2192 't47'. So NT19 can produce 't47' directly. So if in the first step, NT6 produces NT19, which then produces t47, that covers the first token.\n\nSo after NT6's expansion, we get t47. The next part is NT34. Looking at NT34's productions: NT34 \u2192 't3', NT34 \u2192 't38', NT34 \u2192 't50', etc. But also, NT34 can produce NT22 NT0. So perhaps the expansion is NT34 \u2192 NT22 NT0.\n\nLooking at NT22, its productions include NT22 \u2192 't40', NT22 \u2192 't77', NT22 \u2192 't54', etc. Also, NT22 can produce NT6 NT15, NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT0's productions include NT0 \u2192 't66' and others. But from the given grammar, NT0 \u2192 't66' is one of the options.\n\nSo perhaps after NT34, we have NT22 and NT0. Let's see: the next token after t47 is t39. Hmm, t39 is a terminal. Let's check where that appears. From the grammar, looking for 't39': it appears under NT24's productions, but also under NT11. Wait, let me check: \n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT11 \u2192 NT11: no, that's more like an error. Wait, no, wait. Wait, looking at the grammar, for example, NT11 \u2192 't11', NT11 \u2192 't14', etc. Maybe I didn't notice the 't39' placement. \n\nWait, no, looking more closely, under NT11, it's written as \"NT11 -> NT27 NT28\" and \"NT11 -> NT27 NT28\" again? Or perhaps that's a typo. Wait no, let me check the given grammar again.\n\nWait, here's the relevant part of the grammar as provided:\n\nLooking carefully, under NT11, I see:\n\nNT11 -> NT27 NT28\nNT11 -> NT27 NT28\n\nWait, that seems duplicated. Hmm, maybe that's meant to be two different rules, but perhaps a repetition? Not sure, but perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nWait, let me just list all the productions for NT24, NT11, etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that under NT11, there are two rules: \n\n- NT11 \u2192 NT27 NT28\n- NT11 \u2192 NT27 NT28\n\nWhich might be a mistake, perhaps it's duplicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how it's written. Alternatively, maybe it's indicating that NT11 can produce two different non-terminals, but looking closely, both rules are the same. So maybe NT11 can only produce NT27 NT28.\n\nBut getting back to the string: the token after t47 is t39. So after NT6 \u2192 NT19 \u2192 t47, the next part is NT34 \u2192 NT22 NT0, where maybe NT22 produces t40 and NT0 produces t66. But t40 followed by t66 is not matching t39. Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try another way.\n\nLet me start with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nThe string starts with t47, so NT6 must expand into something that starts with t47. From the grammar, the only way to get t47 directly is through NT19 \u2192 't47'. So if NT6 can produce NT19, then we get t47 as the first token.\n\nSo after NT6 \u2192 NT19 \u2192 t47, the next part is NT34. So the next token is t39, so what does NT34 expand into?

The string is `t28 t84 t77 t66 t0 t37 t49 t68 t54 t14 t18 t29 t41 t72 t12 t10 t53 t38 t3`. \n\nFirst, I should look at the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), meaning every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except the start symbol which can produce terminals. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at S's production: S -> NT6 NT34. So S generates two parts: NT6 and NT34.\n\nNext, I need to see how these non-terminals can expand into the string. Let's break down the string into individual tokens and see if I can find a sequence that matches the grammar.\n\nThe string tokens are: [t28, t84, t77, t66, t0, t37, t49, t68, t54, t14, t18, t29, t41, t72, t12, t10, t53, t38, t3]\n\nWait, that's 18 tokens. Hmm, given the grammar rules, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two others, so the number of tokens increases exponentially with each step. Since the starting symbol S has a production with two non-terminals, the string length should be a power of 2 times the number of terminals directly from S. But in this case, the string has 18 tokens, which isn't a power of 2, so maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try parsing the string from the start symbol S and see if it can derive this string.\n\nLet me try to work backwards. The entire string should be derived from S, which is NT6 -> NT6 NT34. Wait, no, S is NT6 followed by NT34. Let me recheck the grammar: S -> NT6 NT34. So the entire string must start with NT6 and end with NT34, but NT34 is a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the productions, NT34 can either be a terminal or have a production. Let me check the production rules.\n\nLooking at NT34, it appears in some productions: NT34 -> 't3'. So when NT34 is used, it must be replaced by 't3'. Wait, actually, in the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n\nSo in the string, I have t38, t3. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'm not sure. Let me check my understanding.\n\nWait, the string has t38 and t3. Looking at the productions, perhaps I should check if there's a path where a NT leads to t3. Let me check each production.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT33 -> NT31 NT17\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n\nSo if a non-terminal can produce 't3', then when that non-terminal is expanded, it will produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nWait, the string has t38 and t3. Maybe t3 comes from NT34, but in the string, the last token is t3. So let me check the production for NT34.\n\nYes, NT34 -> 't3'. That means that whenever we have a part of the string that expands to 't3', it must come from NT34.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is structured such that the last part comes from NT34, and the second last token t53 comes from ... Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me try to see which productions lead to the given terminals. Let's look at the possible ways each terminal can appear.\n\nLooking at NT31: some productions lead to t43, t40, t35, etc., but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to look for terminals that correspond to specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a tree. Let me see:\n\nThe string is t28 t84 t77 t66 t0 t37 t49 t68 t54 t14 t18 t29 t41 t72 t12 t10 t53 t38 t3.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. t28: which non-terminal produces this? Looking through the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces t28. Wait, perhaps looking through the productions, let me check each production.\n\nLooking through the NT's:\n\n- NT17 -> 't66' and 't73'\n- NT7 -> 't66' and 't73'\n- NT22 -> 't25', 't28' [Wait, checking: NT22 -> 't28'? Let's see, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT24 -> 't14' when it's in a production for NT24, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT22 -> 't28' as a production. Wait, checking all the rules:\n\nLooking at NT22's productions:\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\nBut looking through all the NTs, I don't see NT22 directly expanding to 't28'. Instead, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> NT6 NT15\n- NT22 -> NT6 NT10, etc., but none directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the NT15 production:\n\nWait, NT15 -> 't65'\n\nWait, another NT4 -> 't39', NT27->'t54', but I'm not seeing any NT that produces 't28' directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check the NT14 production: NT14 -> 't72'\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any NT has 't28' as a direct production. Looking through all the production rules:\n\nI see NT27 -> NT7 NT7, and then looking through, NT7 has 't66' and 't73', but no t28.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NTs again.\n\nLooking through all the NT production rules:\n\n- NT14: 't72'\n- NT15: 't65'\n- NT20: 't45'\n- NT22: NT6 NT15\n- NT22: NT6 NT10\n- NT22: NT15 NT7\n- NT22: NT14 NT4\n- NT22: NT6 NT4\nWait, no, looking carefully:\n\nWait, I need to check each rule. Maybe I'm focusing on the wrong ones.\n\nLooking at the entire NT set:\n\nNT12: NT1 NT34\nNT14: NT2 NT1\nNT15: NT7 NT4\nNT19: NT24 NT21\nNT20: NT15 NT0\nNT21: NT6 NT15\nNT22: NT6 NT19\nNT26: Not sure if it's an NT\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try another approach.\n\nSince the string starts with t28, I need to see if any NT can be expanded to produce t28. Looking through all NT rules, I see NT27 -> 't73' and 't66', NT7 -> same, NT6 has t80, t20, t29, t66, t27, etc.\n\nWait, looking again, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7, and NT7 -> t66 or t73. So t27 ends in those, not t28.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Maybe t28 comes from a longer expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t28, which is from NT28.\n\nWait, NT28: the production is not in the given list except for NT28 in the production:\n\nNT28 -> NT20 NT11\n\nBut this doesn't directly produce t28. Wait, in the production list, looking for NTs that produce t28.\n\nWait, I think I might have mistaken the structure. Let me list all production rules:\n\nS->NT6 NT34\n\nNT14->NT2 NT1\n\nNT20->NT15 NT0\n\nNT12->NT1 NT34\n\nNT19->NT24 NT21\n\nNT22->NT6 NT19\n\nNT31->NT31 NT17\n\nNT11->NT27 NT28\n\nNT10->NT14 NT31\n\nNT31->NT31 NT7\n\nNT6->NT27 NT19\n\nNT1->NT14 NT28\n\nNT6->NT33 NT19\n\nNT22->NT4 NT15\n\nNT33"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-359","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a particular string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are both quite complex, so I'll need to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recap what I know about CFGs in CNF. CNF has rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminal symbols. Additionally, it can sometimes have a terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal or vice versa, but that depends on the specific variation. However, in standard CNF, each production is strictly two non-terminals. So, in this case, all productions are like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 aB, but in the given grammar, I notice that all productions seem to have two non-terminals on the RHS. So, I might be able to use standard parsing techniques like CYK or recursive descent.\n\nHowever, the string provided is a series of terminal symbols, and the grammar's productions might help in breaking it down. My goal is to see if the entire string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the given string for clarity:\n\nt71, t49, t77, t81, t52, t43, t83, t37, t53, t50, t11, t47, t38, t65, t83, t84, t72, t28, t25.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by examining the start symbol S and its production. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, S must be split into two parts, NT6 and NT34. So, the string must be divided into two parts each generated by NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 18 tokens, so I need to split it into two parts. Let me see how long each part might be. It's probably better to split them into two and see if each part can be generated by NT6 and NT34 respectively.\n\nWait, but I don't know where the split is. Maybe I can look for possible splits and see if any work. Alternatively, perhaps I can look at the productions for NT6 and NT34 and see how they could produce parts of the string.\n\nLet's look at NT6. From the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (twice)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- Wait, some duplicate entries. Looking more carefully, under NT6:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- Also, I see that in the productions, NT6 has:\n\nLooking back: There are two rules for NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, once with 't53', and another with 't25'. Wait, no, looking closely:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (same as before)\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, under NT6, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nAnd another line: NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (which is same as the first one)\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake in the listing. Anyway, the main point is that NT6 has several productions, each with two non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nSo, to produce the string, the part generated by NT6 would have to end at a certain point, and the part generated by NT34 would start right after.\n\nSimilarly, NT34's productions are:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, under NT34, I see:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n- Wait, more carefully:\n\nWait, under NT34:\n\nNo, looking at the productions, under NT34 I don't see any direct rules.

{"custom_id":"request-381","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in a format where each rule is on a separate line, and the right-hand side is just symbols. Since it's in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production should be either a single terminal or two non-terminals. I should check that.\n\nLooking at the rules, most produce two non-terminals, except some produce terminals or maybe more. Wait, I see some rules have two non-terminals, others have a terminal, like `NT10 -> 't77'`, `NT19 -> 't47'`, etc. But in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So I think it's okay because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t43 t10 t37 t73 t57 t84 t45 t55 t61 t25 t49 t52 t77 t72 t77 t22 t41 t10 t23 t53`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. That means each token in the string should correspond to a terminal derived from the start symbol after a series of productions.\n\nMaybe the approach is to parse the string backward, starting from the end, and see if it can be built up by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t43`. Let's see if any production ends with `t43`. Scanning through the rules, I find `NT31 -> 't43'`. So NT31 can produce `t43`. Now, `t43` is the last token, so maybe NT31 is the starting point. Wait, no, the start symbol is S, which is on the left side. So maybe the string starts with something derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built up by starting from S and expanding the symbols until we reach the terminals in the string. But parsing backward is easier perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about each terminal in the string and see what productions could have produced them, then see if the non-terminals can be connected.\n\nLet's list all the tokens and see their possible origins:\n\nt43: from NT31\n\nt10: possible NT10, NT17 (since NT17->'t66', no), NT10->'t77' no, other NT10 rules? Wait, looking back: NT10 is defined as:\n\nNT10 -> 't84'\n\nWait, but also NT10 -> 't12' ??? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nI see NT10 is defined as:\n\nNT10 -> 't84'\n\nand also:\n\nNT10-> 't12' ??? Let me check: the rules include:\n\nNT10 -> 't84'\n\nand\n\nAnother line:\n\nNT10 -> 't12' ??? Wait, let me look through the rules. I see several lines for NT10:\n\nNT10 -> 't84'\n\nNT10 -> 't12'\n\nWait, that can't be right. Each production for a non-terminal should be separate. So NT10 has two productions: one to 't84' and another to 't12'. But in the string, we have `t10`, which is different. Wait, maybe I misread. Oh wait, no: 't10' is a terminal in the string. But in the grammar, are there any NT10 productions that produce 't10'? Looking back, I don't see that. Let me check all NT10 rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT10 -> 't84'\n\nNT10-> 't12'\n\nWait, so in the grammar, NT10 can only produce 't84' and 't12', right? But the string has `t10`, which is a different terminal. So that's a problem. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check the given grammar.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nLines starting with NT10:\n\n- NT10 -> 't84'\n\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n\nSo no production for NT10 -> t10. Therefore, 't10' can't be derived from NT10. Hmm, that's a red flag. Maybe that's the issue.\n\nWait, but the string is:\n\nt43 t10 t37 t73 t57 t84 t45 t55 t61 t25 t49 t52 t77 t72 t77 t22 t41 t10 t23 t53\n\nSo the second token is t10. Let's check all possible NT that can produce t10. Looking through the rules, is there any NT that has 't10' as a terminal?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT10 -> 't84'\n\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n\nWait, so no NT produces 't10'. So 't10' is not in the grammar. Which means the string cannot be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck. Perhaps I misread the rules.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLine: NT10 -> 't84'\n\nAnother line: NT10 -> 't12'\n\nNo, those are the only two. So yes, there's no production for NT10 -> 't10'. So the string has 't10' which can't be produced by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the string is not part of the language generated by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar, 't20' is the terminal of NT20. So, we need to see how NT20 is formed.\n\nNT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n\nSo, NT20 is replaced by NT15 and NT0. So the first step would be to split t20 into NT15 and NT0. Now, we have to derive NT15 and NT0 into their constituent parts.\n\nLooking up NT15's production: NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n\nSo NT15 is NT7 and NT4. Next, NT0 \u2192 't66' from the terminal rules. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, NT7 is a terminal 't72'? Wait, no: looking at NT7's production, it's actually two terminals: NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'. Wait, no, the productions for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or NT7 is only a terminal if it's a direct production, but in the grammar, I think NT7 is a non-terminal because the rules are written as NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'. Wait, no, looking back, the productions:\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT7 being a non-terminal. The productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'. Wait, actually, looking back, I think I may have misinterpreted earlier. Wait, the grammar seems to have several entries for NT7:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't73'\n\nSo NT7 is a non-terminal that can produce either 't66' or 't73'. So NT7 is a non-terminal, not a terminal. Similarly, NT21 is a non-terminal that can produce 't29'.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again carefully. For NT7:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66'\nNT7 \u2192 't73'\n\nSo NT7 is a non-terminal because it's on the left side of the production. So, in the string, when we have 't66', it would come from NT7 produced as 't66'. Similarly, 't77' would come from NT22, as per NT22 \u2192 't77' in the grammar.\n\nWait, wait, looking back:\n\nNT22 has multiple productions, including NT22 \u2192 't77' (from one of the entries). Similarly, NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'. So both are non-terminals.\n\nSo, to proceed, after starting with t20, we split into NT15 and NT0. Then NT15 becomes NT7 and NT4, and NT4 becomes 't29' (since in the rules, NT4 \u2192 't29').\n\nNow, we need to derive NT7 and NT4.\n\nStarting with NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29' (directly from the rules). So that's done.\n\nNext, NT7:\n\nNT7 can be either 't66' or 't73'. In the string, the first occurrence after the initial split is t47, but let's see.\n\nWait, let me map the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t20, t47, t3, t12, t83, t47, t77, t49, t14, t41, t20, t3, t45, t14, t30, t10, t41, t43, t29, t52.\n\nWait, that's"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'll need to see how these non-terminals can generate the string.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to work backwards. The string ends with t41. So which productions could produce t41? Looking at the grammar, I see NT23 \u2192 t41, and NT31 \u2192 t31... Hmm, no, NT31 doesn't go to t31. Wait, looking more carefully, NT34 \u2192 t3, but that's not helpful.

Let me check again. Wait, in the initial grammar, line 70 is NT11 \u2192 't67'. Let me make sure I have all correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the user provided a list that includes multiple entries for some non-terminals. For example, NT1 \u2192 't61' and 't29' (lines 60, 64, 119, etc.).

Wait, let me parse correctly.\n\nWait, the grammar provided in the user message ends in line 124, but it's a bit confusing. Let me look for all lines where a non-terminal is assigned a terminal.\n\nAfter careful examination, here's the list:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66' (line 68)\n- NT1 \u2192 't61' (line 60), 't29' (line 64)\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' (line 72), 't20' (line 96), 't37' (line 113) [Wait, line 96 is NT2 \u2192 't28', line 113 is NT2 \u2192 't21', etc.]\nWait, perhaps it's better to go through all the lines to list all NTx \u2192 'ty' productions.\n\nLooking through each line, let's identify:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-403","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t45 t67 t68 t36 t61 t80 t57 t54 t18 t45 t40 t45 t84 t66 t29 t25 t49 t29 t72 t50 t28`. \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right side of any right-hand side (RHS) in the rules. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some rules have two non-terminals on the RHS, but each production seems to directly produce a terminal or a combination that leads to terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which eventually breaks down into terminals. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in a derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals. Therefore, the length of the string should be 2^n, where n is the number of productions applied, starting from the start symbol S. Let's count the number of tokens in the string: there are 21 tokens. Hmmm, 21 is not a power of 2. The nearest powers are 16 (2^4) and 32 (2^5). Since 21 isn't a power of 2, this suggests that the string might not be generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The string has 21 tokens, which is 2^4 + 5, which isn't a power of two. In CNF, each application of a production doubles the length of the sentential form. Starting from S, after 1 step, we have 2 symbols; after 2 steps, 4; 3 steps, 8; 4 steps, 16; 5 steps, 32. Since 21 isn't on this list, it's not possible to derive it. \n\nAdditionally, looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal eventually produces at least one terminal when you follow the chain. So, the process would break down each rule step by step, but each step would contribute a terminal based on the productions. If at any point a non-terminal can't produce a terminal, it would be a problem, but in this grammar, each production seems to eventually result in a terminal or a combination that can be further broken down into terminals.\n\nAnother point is to check if each terminal appears in the correct place according to the productions. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the string must start with some combination of NT6 and NT34. Let's see the string starts with t45, which I think is from NT6. NT6 \u2192 t80, right? Wait, no, the production for NT6 is to terminals, but let's look. The productions for NT6 are:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nBut looking further, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two productions:\nNT7 \u2192 't66' \nNT7 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t45. Is t45 in the start? Let me check the productions. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT6 NT34. Wait, looking at the grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the entire string starts with NT6 followed by NT34. So, the first part of the string should be the expansion of NT6, and then NT34.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t45, t67, t68... Hmm, t45 is part of NT6's expansion. Wait, but NT6 is a non-terminal; according to the grammar, NT6 can produce several things, but the actual terminals are the ones where NT6 directly goes to a terminal. Let me check the options for NT6:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (twice)\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (twice)\n\nThen, NT27 can be:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the first token is t45. Hmm, where does t45 come from? Let me look for a production that results in t45.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't29', but where's t45 derived from? Oh, wait, perhaps NT24. Let me check:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\n\nBut that's NT14. Let me look for where t45 comes from. Wait, maybe NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't10' or 't25'\n\nWait, NT20 \u2192 't45', because in the grammar, NT20 has a rule NT20 \u2192 't45'. Similarly, NT40: looking through the productions, I see NT17 \u2192 't40' and NT40 somewhere? Wait, perhaps NT20 directly produces 't45', which is in the string. Let's see the string:\n\nt45, t67, t68, t36, t61, t80, t57, t54, t18, t45, t40, t45, t84, t66, t29, t25, t49, t29, t72, t50, t28.\n\nSo, the string starts with t45, which would be from NT20, because NT20 \u2192 't45'. But wait, S starts with NT6 and NT34, not NT20. So if the string starts with t45, it must come from NT20, but S is only producing NT6 and NT34. So if the string starts with t45, that's from NT20, but NT20 is not directly reachable from S because S starts with NT6.\n\nThat's confusing because S's first step is NT6 NT34, and NT6 doesn't produce 't45', unless I'm missing a production. Wait, no, the productions for NT6 are all to non-terminals. So if the first token is 't45', that must come from NT20. But how does NT20 get triggered from S? Because S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So if NT6 or NT34 can somehow produce a 't45', but looking at the rules for NT6, they don't directly produce terminals except through other non-terminals. So that brings me to think that the string might not be valid because the start symbol S doesn't produce 't45'.\n\nWait, let me check the production for NT20:\n\nThe grammar for NT20 is:\nNT20 \u2192 't45'\n\nSo NT20 can produce 't45' directly. So if the string starts with t45, that would be NT20. But S starts with NT6 and NT34. So how does NT20 get triggered? Unless one of those non-terminals can expand into NT20.\n\nWait, let's look at what NT6 and NT34 can produce. \n\nLooking at NT6, from the production rules, NT6 can go to NT27 NT19, etc. If I can get from NT6 to NT20, then perhaps t45 can appear. Let's see.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each expansion produces exactly two symbols at a time, and each step doubles the length. Wait, but the string is 21 tokens, which isn't a power of two. That suggests that the expansion must have undergone 4 steps (resulting in 16 tokens) plus some additional steps, which is impossible in CNF. Because each step in derivation using CNF can only increase the number of symbols by a factor of 2. So the number of tokens must be 2^n.\n\nSince the string has 21 tokens, that's not possible. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo my conclusion is that the string is not generated by the given grammar because the number of tokens isn't a power of two, and the initial symbols can't produce the required first token 't45'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 21 tokens, which isn't a power of two, so it can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Maybe I should map each terminal to its corresponding value:\n\nLet me list each terminal and its value:\n\nt38 -> NT22\nt83 -> NT11\nt55 -> NT33\nt40 -> NT17\nt30 -> NT33\nt45 -> NT20\nt65 -> NT15\nt81 -> NT31\nt0 -> NT0\nt45 -> NT20 again\nt68 -> NT12\nt3 -> NT34\nt47 -> NT19\nt73 -> NT7\nt67 -> NT11\nt49 -> NT25\nt20 -> NT2\nt72 -> NT14\nt47 again -> NT19\nt3 -> NT34\nt55 -> NT33\nt81 -> NT31 twice\nt81 again. Wait, that's three times t81.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the approach. Since the grammar is in CNF and consists of both terminals and non-terminals, perhaps the best way to approach this is to try to perform a top-down parsing, using a recursive descent approach or some kind of parse table. But since it's CNF, the derivation is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree and see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to look for the start symbol S, which is S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo, the entire string must start with NT6 followed by NT34. But in our string, the first token is t38, which corresponds to NT22. So S is supposed to produce NT6 and NT34. But t38 is NT22, which isn't NT6 or NT34. Therefore, this suggests that the first token is from a production that isn't the start symbol. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial mapping.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals correspond to specific non-terminals. So, each 'tX' is a terminal associated with a specific non-terminal. For example:\n\nt77: NT10, NT22, NT20\n\nt47: NT19, NT0\n\nt65: NT15\n\nt3: NT34\n\nt55: NT33\n\nt22: NT18\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t38, t83, etc. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check which non-terminals produce each t-terminal.\n\nLooking back:\n\nt38: NT22 (from NT22 -> 't38')\n\nt83: NT11 (from NT11 -> 't83')\n\nt55: NT33 (from NT33 -> 't55')\n\nt40: NT17 (from NT17 -> 't40')\n\nt30: NT33 (from NT33 -> 't30')\n\nt45: NT20 (from NT20 -> 't45')\n\nt65: NT15 (from NT15 -> 't65')\n\nt81: NT31 (from NT31 -> 't81')\n\nt0: NT0 (from NT0 -> 't66')\n\nt47: NT19 (from NT19 -> 't47')\n\nt3: NT34 (from NT34 -> 't3')\n\nt55: NT33\n\nt81: NT31\n\nt81 again.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't81' twice, but in the grammar, I think each occurrence is as per the RHS of the non-terminals. So, the parsing might have to handle that.\n\nBut stepping back, the approach is to parse the string from left to right, matching the productions' RHS in the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, each production's RHS is a sequence of non-terminals or terminals. Given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, each step of parsing reduces two elements (non-terminals or terminals) into one.\n\nSo, the strategy is to parse the string, starting from the beginning, and at each step, try to match a production's RHS to the current tokens. This is similar to the way recursive descent parsers work.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. The initial goal is to match the entire string using S's production: S -> NT6 NT34, which is \"t38 NT6, t34\".\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, S is S -> NT6 NT34, and NT6 is 't20' from the mappings. So the first production for S should result in 't20' followed by 't34' (since S would be NT6 (t20) and NT34 (t3)).\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, S is S -> NT6 NT34.

{"custom_id":"request-448","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t53 t47 t45 t28 t45 t83 t36 t83 t3 t61 t30 t49 t55 t10 t18 t10 t77 t12 t23 t36 t77 t66 t73`, and I need to figure out if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that the start symbol cannot be on the right side. It also usually involves that A does not produce a single terminal, though I think there's an exception sometimes where it can produce a terminal along with non-terminals. So I need to check if the given grammar follows these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that most of them are in the form of non-terminals producing two non-terminals, but I notice some rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal followed by a non-terminal or just a single terminal, like NT24 \u2192 NT14, which is problematic because in CNF each rule should have exactly two non-terminals on the right. For example, NT24 \u2192 NT14 would produce a single NT14, which isn't allowed in CNF. So there's an issue here. Wait, actually, in CNF, a production can be A \u2192 a B where 'a' is a terminal, but I think the terminals can only appear on the left side as a single terminal. So that's allowed, but A cannot produce just a single terminal by itself.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar rules, there's a rule like NT10 \u2192 't12'. That's problematic because a non-terminal is directly producing a terminal. Alternatively, in CNF, a production can be A \u2192 a, but that's allowed only for the start symbol, and even then, it's a single terminal. Wait, no: in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in the latter case, it's only for the start symbol. So, in this grammar, if any non-terminal except the start symbol is directly producing a terminal, that's not in CNF anymore. So in the provided grammar, NT10 produces 't12', which is a terminal, and similarly NT15 \u2192 't65', NT1 \u2192 't61', etc. So that violates the CNF because non-terminals are producing terminals.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me confirm. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC, where a is a terminal, and B, C are non-terminals. So for a derivation, non-terminals can only be broken down into other non-terminals. Terminals are leaves in the derivation tree. So if any non-terminal A has a rule A \u2192 a (i.e., directly produces a terminal), that's not in CNF because CNF doesn't allow terminals on the right side except in the case where they're the only symbols. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check again.\n\nYes, CNF requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the latter is only allowed for the start symbol. So if any non-terminal other than the start symbol has a production to a terminal, that's not CNF. In this case, the grammar provided has many non-terminals directly producing terminals, which is invalid CNF. Therefore, perhaps the grammar isn't in CNF, but the initial question says it's in CNF. Hmm, but the initial statement says the grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, so perhaps the given rules are in CNF.\n\nWait, no, because in the provided grammar, many rules are like NT10 \u2192 't12', which would mean that NT10 produces a terminal. That's not allowed in CNF because all productions must have non-terminals on the right except for at most the start symbol, which can produce a single terminal. So perhaps the grammar provided isn't in CNF, or perhaps the question meant the grammar is given normally. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the grammar is correct, even if it has non-standard productions, as perhaps there's an error in the question setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in thinking that it's in CNF, but perhaps the grammar is correct as per CNF. Let's assume that the grammar is correct, as per the question, so I can proceed despite this discrepancy.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the given string to see if it can be generated by this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals: t53, t47, t45, etc. To check if the string is generated by the grammar, I can attempt to parse it backwards, starting from the start symbol S, and see if each terminal can be replaced by the corresponding non-terminal according to the grammar rules. Since it's a CFG, a top-down parsing approach would work.\n\nThe string is: `t53 t47 t45 t28 t45 t83 t36 t83 t3 t61 t30 t49 t55 t10 t18 t10 t77 t12 t23 t36 t77 t66 t73`.\n\nLet's note the terminals in order: t53, t47, t45, t28, t45, t83, t36, t83, t3, t61, t30, t49, t55, t10, t18, t10, t77, t12, t23, t36, t77, t66, t73.\n\nI'll process the string from the end to see if I can find the rules that produce these terminals.\n\nLooking up in the grammar, I'll check if any non-terminal directly produces each terminal.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't12' (so 't12' is derived from NT10)\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\nNT1 \u2192 't61'\nNT6 \u2192 't20', 't33', etc.\nNT4 \u2192 't29', 't4', etc.\nNT27 \u2192 't72', 't7', etc.\nNT7 \u2192 't66', 't73'\nNT6 \u2192 't80'\nNT2 \u2192 't28'\nNT21 \u2192 't37', 't81', etc.\nNT25 \u2192 't49', 't57'\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\nNT22 \u2192 't77' (so 't77' comes from NT22)\nNT34 \u2192 't3'\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\nnt10 -> 't40' (also nt10 \u2192 t40 and nt10 \u2192 t84)\nWait, looking back, I see that nt10 has multiple rules: nt10 \u2192 't12', 't40', 't84'. So in the given string, we have 't10' appearing twice. Let me check nt10's rules.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\nNT10 \u2192 't12'\nNT10 \u2192 't40'\nNT10 \u2192 't84'\n\nSo 't10' might actually be a typo, but in the string provided, it's 't10' in reverse. Wait, no, the terminals are all lowercase t followed by a number, except in the grammar, I see 't10', not t10. Wait, looking back, no, the grammar actually has NT10 \u2192 't10', not 't10' written as 't10'. Wait, let me look: in the grammar, the lines start with 'NT10 -> 't12'', etc. So actually, the terminals in the grammar are with the first letter capitalized as 'T' followed by the number, e.g., 't10', 't12', etc. So in the string, 't10' corresponds to NT10 producing that.\n\nNow, the string has 't10', 't18', 't10' as part of it. Wait, but in the grammar, I think I may have misread:\n\nLooking back, in the grammar:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't12', 't40', 't84'\nand\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65', \nNT1 \u2192 't61', \nNT6 \u2192 't33', 't27'\nWait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me list the grammar rules correctly.\n\nThe grammar is given in the form:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n... and so on, with each line starting with NT followed by a number, then an arrow, then the right-hand side, which is either a terminal or another NT.\n\nFor example,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So, if the grammar can start from S and derive this exact sequence, then the answer is 'Yes'. Otherwise, 'No'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the first two elements in the string must be derived from NT6 and NT34. Let's break down the first two symbols: t80 and t45. Hmm, in the grammar rules, I see NT22 \u2192 't77' but nothing for NT80. Wait, looking through all the terminals, NT80 isn't present. Instead, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20', 't33', 't36', etc.\nLooking at the first terminal t80, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces t80. This might be a problem because the grammar doesn't have a production for NT80.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules. Scanning all the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that expands to t80. The closest is NT2 \u2192 't28', but that's different. So if the first symbol is t80, which isn't produced by any production, then the grammar can't produce this string. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check all the symbols to ensure none are missing from the grammar. Checking each term:\n\nt80: Not present.\nt45: NT20 \u2192 't45' \u2014 yes.\nt43: Looking for NT43. I don't see any non-terminal that produces t43. Wait, NT31 \u2192 t43; but let me check. The grammar has NT31 \u2192 't43'. Oh, so t43 is valid.\n\nt38: Checking for NT38. Looking through the rules, I see NT31 \u2192 't35', NT31 \u2192 't33', but nothing for t38. Wait, NT6 \u2192 t33, but that's 't33', right. So t38 isn't produced by any rule.\n\nWait, let me double-check. \n\nLooking at NT6 productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nWait, in the rules:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWait, so NT6 can produce NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25 twice. But the terminals derived from NT6 would be a combination of the terminals from these. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, each production of a non-terminal like NT6 is a rule that replaces it with two other symbols. Some of these are terminals, some are non-terminals. So, when expanding NT6, it might eventually lead to terminals through further productions.\n\nBut looking at the beginning of the string: t80 is the first symbol. So, can any non-terminal S or any intermediate symbol produce t80? \n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t80. All the terminals are like t66, t45, etc. So, since the first symbol is t80, which isn't present in the grammar, the string can't be generated by this grammar.

It's in Chomsky normal form, which is good because I know how to parse it, though I need to be careful. Each production is left-hand side (LHS) being a single non-terminal and right-hand side (RHS) being two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nThe start symbol is S, which immediately produces NT6 NT34. So any valid string must start with whatever NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t37, which is a terminal. I need to see which non-terminals can produce t37. Let's check the productions for NTs:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT27: NT7 NT7 doesn't produce t37. NT18: NT17 NT10; no. NT10: 't12' or 't84', also no. NT1: 't61' or 't29'. NT4: 't29'. NT21: 't37' or 't81'. Oh, wait! NT21 produces t37. So the first part of the string, t37, can come from NT21. \n\nSo the first symbol is from NT21. Now, looking at the grammar for NT21: the productions are NT37 or NT81. Hmm, wait, the given grammar seems to have multiple entries for each NT. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT21, there are two productions:\nNT21 -> t37 or t81. So NT21 can be replaced by either 't37' or 't81'. \n\nSo the first token is t37, so NT21 must have been expanded to t37. Therefore, the initial production S -> NT6 NT34 must have branches that produce something that, through further expansion, starts with NT21. Wait, but S is NT6 and NT34. So NT6 and NT34 need to produce parts of the string.\n\nWait no, the initial expansion is S -> NT6 NT34, so the first part of the string must come from NT6 and the second from NT34. But since the first symbol is t37, which comes from NT21, this is conflicting because NT6 is for t66, t67, etc., but t37 isn't in NT6's productions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the NTs can be expanded into strings of terminals. Let me think about how the productions chain together. For example, S generates NT6 NT34. If NT6 and NT34 can each generate a string, then the full string is the concatenation of the two.\n\nSo the string starts with t37, which must come from NT21. But S's first production is NT6 and NT34. So either NT6 or NT34 must expand to include t37 at the first position. Or, perhaps, the first part of the expansion leads to t37. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the NT6 and NT34 each produce a series of terminals, and the entire string is their concatenation. So the first part of the string (t37) must come from NT6, and the second part (t73, t66, etc.) from NT34. Or maybe they are interleaved, but given the way CFGs work, it's all terminals concatenated.\n\nWait, no, each production is a direct replacement. So S -> NT6 NT34, which means the string is the concatenation of NT6's expansion and NT34's expansion. So the string starts with NT6's part, then NT34's part. The given string has 24 tokens, so maybe both NT6 and NT34 produce 12 tokens each?\n\nWait, let me count the length of the string: t37 (1), t73 (2), t66 (3), t25 (4), t43 (5), t22 (6), t11 (7), t45 (8), t47 (9), t40 (10), t35 (11), t68 (12), t67 (13), t71 (14), t73 (15), t25 (16), t25 (17), t23 (18), t0 (19), t50 (20), t57 (21), t49 (22), t12 (23), t72 (24). So 24 tokens total.\n\nEach side (NT6 and NT34) should produce 12 tokens each.\n\nSo for NT6, starting from S, the expansion starts with NT6. Let's see what NT6 can produce. Looking back at the grammar, NT6 has several productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT25 NT21\nNT6 -> NT27 NT7\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT19 NT33 (Wait, that's same as first)\nWait, looking through:\n\nI see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT25 NT21\nNT6 -> NT27 NT7\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT19 NT33 (Same as previous, perhaps a typo)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nThe productions for NT6 are:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT25 NT21\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT19 NT33 (I think that's a repetition)\nAnd perhaps more, but maybe that's all.\n\nSo from NT6, we can derive two sequences. Let's consider if any of these can produce a sequence that starts with t37, which is the first token in the string.\n\nLooking at the possible first symbols from NT6:\n\nNT21: for example, NT6 -> NT21 NT25. Then, NT21 can produce t37. So starting with t37.\n\nSo perhaps the production is NT6 -> NT21 NT25. Then, NT21 can be expanded to t37, and NT25 must be expanded to a sequence that starts with t73.\n\nWait, the second token in the string is t73. So after t37 comes t73. So the second part would be t25 (from NT25) and t73.\n\nBut wait, let me check NT25's productions. Looking through:\n\nNT25: NT21 NT25?

Let me recheck the given grammar.\n\nWait, given:\n\n``` \nNT25 -> NT49 NT57\nBTW, the given grammar includes:\n\nNT25 -> NT49 NT57\nYes, so NT25 produces NG49 and NT57.

The string to evaluate is:\n\n`t23 t67 t18 t11 t43 t81 t41 t53 t35 t25 t55 t29 t72 t50 t66 t23 t77 t20 t54 t10 t49 t18 t49 t39`\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided seems to fit that structure because all the symbols on the right side of the arrows have either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34 (S \u2192 NT6 NT34). So, to generate any string, S must expand by combining these two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will then expand according to their own production rules.\n\nNow, the string starts with `t23`, `t67`, etc. I need to see if each terminal from the string can be derived by expanding the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the production rules for the non-terminals that start with 't' from the string. For example, `t67` is a terminal, so in the grammar, we need a production rule where the non-terminal directly produces `t67`. Looking through the list:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production rule where the non-terminal leads directly to `t67`. Scanning through the list, I see:\n\n- NT76 \u2192 Not present, but looking for 't67' as a terminal. Let me think.\n\nActually, I need to look through all the right-hand sides of the grammar rules to see which ones produce 't67'. Let me go through the grammar rules one by one.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17, NT10 \u2192 't77', NT14 \u2192 't72', NT19 \u2192 't47', NT22 \u2192 't77', NT1 \u2192 't61', NT6 \u2192 't20', NT1 \u2192 't29', NT27 \u2192 't72', NT4 \u2192 't29', NT21 \u2192 't37', NT0 \u2192 't66', NT17 \u2192 't66', NT18 \u2192 't22', NT10 \u2192 't12', NT1 \u2192 't14', NT11 \u2192 't11', NT18 \u2192 't53', NT22 \u2192 't38', NT34 \u2192 't3', NT33 \u2192 't55', NT22 \u2192 't10', NT20 \u2192 't45', NT17 \u2192 't40', NT14 \u2192 't72', NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73', NT6 \u2192 't80', NT2 \u2192 't28', NT21 \u2192 't81', NT21 \u2192 't29', NT4 \u2192 't36', NT25 \u2192 't49', NT25 \u2192 't57', NT24 \u2192 't14', NT10 \u2192 't84', NT31 \u2192 't43', NT10 \u2192 't40', NT33 \u2192 't30', NT21 \u2192 't71', NT11 \u2192 't83', NT12 \u2192 't68', NT11 \u2192 't54', NT19 \u2192 't23', NT4 \u2192 't39', NT11 \u2192 't67', NT15 \u2192 't18', NT34 \u2192 't41', NT22 \u2192 't25', NT20 \u2192 't66', NT34 \u2192 't50', NT6 \u2192 't52', NT17 \u2192 't54', NT31 \u2192 't35', NT0 \u2192 't0', NT2 \u2192 't37'.\n\nWait, looking carefully, I see:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't29' (appears twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't39'\n- NT11 \u2192 't67'\n\nAh, there we go. So NT11 has a production rule NT11 \u2192 t67. That means if in the derivation, a NT11 non-terminal is encountered, it can be replaced directly by 't67'.\n\nNow, let's see where else 't67' is in the string. The string is:\n\n1 t23\n2 t67\n3 t18\n4 t11\n5 t43\n6 t81\n7 t41\n8 t53\n9 t35\n10 t25\n11 t55\n12 t29\n13 t72\n14 t50\n15 t66\n16 t23\n17 t77\n18 t20\n19 t54\n20 t10\n21 t49\n22 t18\n23 t49\n24 t39\n\nSo starting from S, which is NT6 NT34.\n\nLet's see what possible paths lead to the string. Each step will expand into the next terminals. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't23'. So, in the grammar, somewhere a non-terminal must produce 't23'. Looking at the production rules, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't23'. Hmm, wait, did I miss any?\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' and 't12'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n- NT11 \u2192 't67'\n\nWait, is there a production that leads to 't23'? Hmm, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't23'. So unless 't23' is produced indirectly through multiple steps, but that seems unlikely because 't23' is not present in any of the right-hand sides except as part of a terminal in a production, which only appears in the 't66' or 't73' cases.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. I see NT19 \u2192 t47, NT1 \u2192 t61, NT6 \u2192 t20, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if 't23' is a terminal, and check if any production rule can derive it.\n\nLooking again, I don't see any NT that produces 't23' directly. So maybe the string cannot be generated because 't23' doesn't appear on any production list.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't23', which is at position 1. So if there's no production that can derive 't23', then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, could it be that 't23' is produced indirectly? For instance, suppose that some NT eventually expands to 't23'. But looking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- All NTs expand to either two NTs or some terminal and NTs.\n\nBut looking through the productions, I don't see any NT on the right-hand side of a production that can expand into 't23'. So I think that's not possible. Therefore, since 't23' is in the string, and the grammar doesn't have any production that can expand to 't23', the entire string is not in the language.\n\nWait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the production rules. Are there any NTs that can expand to 't23'?\n\nLooking again at the list:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' and 't12'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n- NT11 \u2192 't67'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20', etc.\n\nSo, no NT directly produces 't23'. So, if the string starts with 't23', the grammar cannot derive it, and thus the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing an NT that can lead to 't23' via multiple expansions. For example, perhaps some NT leads to 't23' through a chain of expansions. But looking at all the production rules, I don't see any path that leads to 't23' from any NT.

The terminals here seem to be strings like 't68', 't35', etc.\n\nI need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. The string consists of 24 tokens, all of which are terminals.

NT6 -> t20 (Wait, no, in the grammar, under NT6, I see:\n\nLooking back: Under NT6, the productions are:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> t20 (Wait, perhaps earlier in the list? Or is this 't20' another terminal?)\n\nWait, in the given grammar, after a lot of non-terminals, there's:\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo NT6 can produce 't20' as a terminal. That's a single terminal.\n\nSo in the string, the first symbol is 't68'. So the first step would be to see how 't68' is derived. Looking for where 't68' appears as a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 can become 't20'? Wait, no, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6:\n\nLooking through each line, I see several NT6 productions, including:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- Then, under NT6, there's a line:\n\"NT6 -> 't20'\"\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me check the initial grammar:\n\nLooking back, the grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34. Then the NT's are listed. Let me check NT6's productions again.\n\nUnder NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\nWait, that's a single terminal 't20'. So NT6 can directly produce 't20' as a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't68', not 't20'. So how is 't68' being produced?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe 't68' is derived from a non-terminal. Let me check the grammar to see which non-terminal can produce 't68'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT7 can produce 't73' or 't66', and NT0 can produce 't66'.\n\nWait, no 't68' directly. Let me look further. Wait, maybe a longer derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps 't68' comes from NT6, but I don't see NT6 having 't68' as a terminal. Alternatively, perhaps 't68' comes from a non-terminal that's derived from other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is being constructed by combining the terminals from the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should work backwards. Each symbol in the string must be the result of a single production step. So the string is a sequence of terminals, which must be generated by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which expands to NT6 NT34. So the initial production is [T6, T34].\n\nEach of these non-terminals then expands further. Let's say T6 expands to something and T34 expands to something else, and so on, until all are terminals.\n\nSo the string should be a series of expansions leading to all terminals.\n\nLet me see the first token is 't68'. So, how is 't68' produced? There must be a production for some non-terminal that can derive 't68'. Let's check the grammar for any production that leads to 't68'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that produces 't68' as a terminal. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding, or maybe I need to consider the structure differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map out the productions that eventually lead to terminal symbols.\n\nLet me take some time and look for which non-terminals can produce 't68' through their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> 't77' or 't47' or 't72'\n- NT11 -> 't68' or 't54' etc.\n\nAh, here's one: NT11 can produce 't68'.\n\nSo, if the string has 't68' early on, perhaps it's generated by NT11.\n\nBut wait, to get 't68', that 't68' must come from a production where the non-terminal is NT11. So perhaps in the derivation, one of the non-terminals at some point becomes NT11 and then expands to 't68'.\n\nLet me check the string again:\n\nThe string starts with 't68 t35 t35 t54...'.\n\nSo the first three symbols are t68, t35, t35.\n\nBut in the grammar, how does that happen?\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT6 NT34. So the initial step is S => [NT6, NT34].\n\nNow, NT6 can expand to 't20' directly, as per one of its productions. Alternatively, it can expand to other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 can produce 't3' or 't47' or others.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t68, which is a terminal. So that suggests that the first terminal comes from a non-terminal that produces it.

{"custom_id":"request-482","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Okay, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, and I can use algorithms like the CYK algorithm to check if a string is in the language. But I'm not sure if I need to use an algorithm or if I can parse the string manually. Since the string is pretty long, maybe it's manageable.\n\nThe provided string is: `t43 t80 t22 t23 t11 t65 t45 t52 t25 t66 t77 t68 t84 t35 t57 t45 t11 t71 t50 t22 t61 t47 t45 t30 t12`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of them are terminals, so the string can be broken down into these terminals, which correspond to non-terminals in the grammar. For example, t43 corresponds to NT10->t43, t80 corresponds to NT2->t80, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Eventually, the derivation would replace those non-terminals with terminals. So, the string should be a series of terminals derived from a series of non-terminals.\n\nLet me outline the approach: parse the string from left to right, splitting it into pairs that correspond to the production rules.\n\nThe string has 28 tokens (since it's 28 t's). Each production in the grammar has two non-terminals on the left, so during parsing, each step combines two symbols into one. Therefore, for a string of length n, you need n-1 steps to derive it from the start symbol. But that might not help directly. Alternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step, breaking it down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking for the start symbol's production. The start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo S is derived from NT6 and NT34. That means the string can be split into two parts, first the part generated by NT6 and then the part generated by NT34. Let's see if the string can be divided accordingly.\n\nThe entire string is 28 tokens. So, if NT6 produces the first part and NT34 produces the second part, I need to find where the split is. Each production in the grammar, in CNF, appends one symbol at a time, but since each production splits into two, the length might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach it with a recursive or top-down parsing method. Let's try to see if each part fits.\n\nFirst, let's identify the symbols in the string:\n\n1. t43\n2. t80\n3. t22\n4. t23\n5. t11\n6. t65\n7. t45\n8. t52\n9. t25\n10. t66\n11. t77\n12. t68\n13. t84\n14. t35\n15. t57\n16. t45\n17. t11\n18. t71\n19. t50\n20. t22\n21. t61\n22. t47\n23. t45\n24. t30\n25. t12\n\nSo, 25 symbols, but wait, the initial count was 28; maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, checking again: The string is provided as `t43 t80 t22 t23 t11 t65 t45 t52 t25 t66 t77 t68 t84 t35 t57 t45 t11 t71 t50 t22 t61 t47 t45 t30 t12` \u2013 that's 27 tokens. Wait, maybe I miswrote earlier. Let me count: t43 is 1, t80 2, t22 3, t23 4, t11 5, t65 6, t45 7, t52 8, t25 9, t66 10, t77 11, t68 12, t84 13, t35 14, t57 15, t45 16, t11 17, t71 18, t50 19, t22 20, t61 21, t47 22, t45 23, t30 24, t12 25. So 25 tokens. Hmm, but in the initial breakdown, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the CYK algorithm usually deals with symbols, so perhaps each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. So, the string is a series of terminals, each step adding one symbol.\n\nNow, starting with the start symbol S, which is NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, the first step is to see if the string starts with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the first symbol t43. In the grammar, NT10->t43. So, t43 comes from NT10.\n\nLooking at the rule for NT10: NT10 -> NT14 NT31.\n\nSo, after NT10, we have NT14 and NT31. Each of these can be further broken down.\n\nLooking at NT14: NT14->t72 (from NT14->t72). Wait, no, in the grammar, NT14 is replaced by 't72' (from NT14 -> 't72').\n\nWait, but in the rules, NT7 -> 't66' and NT7-> 't73', etc. Wait, in the given grammar, the non-terminals are being replaced by terminals. For example, NT10 is replaced by t43, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a non-terminal in the grammar. So, for each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nBut since the string is given as a sequence of terminals, perhaps it's easier to build the derivation from the bottom up. Alternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can group the string into parts that fit the rules.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe first symbol is t43, which is NT10->t43. So, NT10 is the first non-terminal to produce this. The rule for NT10 is NT10-> NT14 NT31.\n\nSo, NT14 and NT31 need to produce the rest of the string from t80 onwards.\n\nWait, the second symbol is t80, which is NT2->t80. So, the second non-terminal is NT2.\n\nBut NT10 is supposed to produce NT14 and NT31, not NT2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, that suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The entire string is S, which is NT6 NT34. So, S is split into NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, the first part is generated by NT6, and the second part by NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6->NT27 NT19.\n\nSo, the first part starts with NT27 and NT19. The string starts with t43, which is NT10. So, maybe I need to see if NT6 can produce the first part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by splitting the string into chunks that correspond to the non-terminals. Let's try.\n\nThe start symbol S is NT6 NT34. So, the entire string must be generated by NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nSo, the string can be divided into two parts: the first part is generated by NT6, and the second by NT34.\n\nSo, let's check if the string can be split into two parts that are generated by NT6 and NT34 respectively.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: NT6->NT27 NT19.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be generated by NT27 and NT19.\n\nSimilarly, NT34's production is NT34->NT33 NT55 and NT34->t3, but looking at the rules, NT34->t3. Wait, looking at the rules: NT34->t3 and NT34->something else? Wait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT34 -> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is: `t43 t38 t54 t29 t45 t50 t81 t55 t3 t77 t68 t67 t20 t0 t23 t53 t49 t38 t22 t83 t36 t20 t72 t29 t12 t25`.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll recall that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol. This form is useful for parsing because it simplifies the rules, making it easier to apply algorithms like CYK parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to fit CNF because each LHS is a single non-terminal, and the RHS is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, S -> NT6 NT34 is a two-symbol RHS, which is allowed in CNF. Some other productions like NT1 -> 't61' are terminals, which is also allowed.\n\nNow, to check if the string is generated by this grammar, I can approach this in a few ways. One way is to try to parse the string using the grammar's rules and see if it can fully derive the string. Alternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, I might try to see if the string can be expanded into the start symbol S.\n\nBut manually expanding the string step by step might be quite complex. Another approach is to look for sequences of terminals that match the productions starting from S. Alternatively, I can create a parse tree starting from S and see if it can generate the given string.\n\nLet me look at the given string to see if it can be broken down into parts that correspond to the productions. The string is a sequence of terminals: t43, t38, t54, t29, t45, t50, t81, t55, t3, t77, t68, t67, t20, t0, t23, t53, t49, t38, t22, t83, t36, t20, t72, t29, t12, t25.\n\nI should try to find possible non-terminals that can produce these terminal sequences. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t43. Looking at the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't40', NT11 -> 't11', NT6 -> 't20, t27, etc. Wait, let's check the productions:\n\nLooking for 't43' in the productions. I see NT0 -> 't66', NT0 -> 't72', NT0 -> 't0', etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions first.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that several NTs have terminal symbols. Here are some key ones:\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20, t27, etc. Specifically, NT6 has multiple productions: 't80', 't27', 't66', 't52', etc.\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the NTs that have terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list each NT and its terminals:\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20', 't27', 't77', etc.\nWait, I need to check each NT:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nChecking NT6's productions, for example, one of them is 't20' (from NT6 -> NT2 NT0, but wait, no. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar:\n\nThe grammar has the following terminal productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nNT6 -> 't27'\n\nNT7 -> 't66'\n\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nNT6 -> 't80'\n\nNT21 -> 't71'\n\nNT21 -> 't29'\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list each NT that has a terminal symbol:\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\n- NT6 -> 't27'\n\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n\n- NT18 -> 't22'\n\n- NT22 -> 't77' (as per NT22's rule: NT22 -> 't77')\n\nWait, but in the given string, I see 't77' is the 4th symbol: the string starts with t43, t38, t54, t29,... So looking at the 10th symbol of the string, it's 't77'. Hmm, so where does 't77' come from? Checking the production rules, NT22 -> 't77' is present. So that suggests that a NT22 must have produced this symbol.\n\nLooking for 't77', I see that it's the product of NT22. So perhaps in the parse, 't77' comes from NT22.\n\nNow, let's backtrack: the string is t43 t38 t54 t29 t45 t50 t81 t55 t3 t77 ...\n\nWait, so the symbol after 't29' is 't45', which is the 5th symbol. Let me see which NT could produce 't45'. Looking at the productions, I see NT25 -> 't49', NT38 has... Hmm, wait, perhaps I should check for 't45'.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:\n\n- NT22 -> 't45' (from NT22 -> 't45')\n\nYes, so the 5th symbol is 't45', which must come from NT22.\n\nSo far, I can have a production like NT22 -> 't45' as the 5th step.\n\nBut the 4th symbol is 't29', which could come from NT21 since NT21 has 't29' as one of its productions: NT21 -> 't29'.\n\nWait, that's 29? Let me check the production rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT21 has two productions: NT21 -> 't71' and NT21 -> 't29'. So the 4th symbol is 't29', which could come from NT21.\n\nSo the first four symbols: t43, t38, t54, t29. Now, 't29' is NT21.\n\nSo that suggests that we have something like NT21 -> t29. Now, how do we get the symbols before that?\n\nWait, the string starts with t43, t38, t54, t29. So the first four symbols are 't43', 't38', 't54', 't29'.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. Each non-terminal leads to two symbols or terminals, so perhaps each step combines two symbols into one non-terminal.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to parse from the start. The start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the entire string should be reducible to NT6 NT34, which then further reduces into terminals.\n\nSo let's see: the start symbol S produces NT6 and NT34. Each of these can produce sequences of terminals. So the entire string should be equivalent to (something from NT6) followed by (something from NT34).\n\nSo the string is: [T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T11 T12 T13 T14 T15 T16 T17 T18 T19 T20 T21 T22 T23]\n\nLet me split this into two parts: the first part should come from NT6, and the second from NT34.\n\nLet me see the length: 24 symbols. So NT6 produces the first 12 symbols, and NT34 the next 12? Or perhaps the split is arbitrary, but likely each NT expands into a certain number of symbols.\n\nWait, actually, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals). So for each step, the number of symbols can increase, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-501","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string. I need to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. The string is: `t55 t53 t57 t28 t12 t20 t25 t11 t11 t52 t14 t84 t53 t23 t30 t36 t28 t20 t29 t47 t30 t29 t53 t23 t20 t20`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form grammars have all production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So I can check each rule in the grammar to see if they fit this form.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see a lot of rules like S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which is of the form NT6 \u2192 NTa NTb, so that's fine. Similarly, all other rules seem to be of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 a. So the structure is correct.\n\nNext, I think about how to parse the given string using this grammar. Parsing can be done with algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars. But since I'm just starting out, maybe I can parse it step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t55`. I look for a production rule that starts with a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see NT33 \u2192 t55. So the first token `t55` must come from NT33. So, the first step would be to fire the rule NT33 \u2192 t55.\n\nNow, after generating `t55`, I need to figure out how to produce the next part of the string, which is `t53 t57 t28`. So after NT33, I need to see what NT33 can produce. Looking back, the rule is NT33 \u2192 t55, so it's just a terminal, meaning once it's generated, the grammar stops for that part, but wait, that might not make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky normal form, each production either introduces a non-terminal on two sides or a terminal. So in this case, NT33 directly produces `t55`, so it's a leaf node. So if the string starts with `t55`, then that's correct, but that's only one character. The entire string is 27 characters, so maybe each `t` is a single symbol.\n\nBut let me think again: the string is a sequence of terminals, and each step in parsing would correspond to deriving these terminals. So perhaps each `t` is a single production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, some NTs produce a single terminal, like NT10 \u2192 t12, etc. So maybe when we have a `tX`, we can directly use the corresponding NT rule. But in this problem, the string uses `t` followed by a number, like `t55`, `t53`, etc.\n\nSo to parse the entire string, I need to see if each `tX` can be generated by some non-terminal, and how the non-terminals can derive the sequence.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can create a list of all rules that produce terminals. Let me list them:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t12\n- NT1 \u2192 t61\n- NT6 \u2192 t20\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n- NT15 \u2192 t65\n- NT19 \u2192 t47\n- NT22 \u2192 t77\n- NT4 \u2192 t29\n- NT21 \u2192 t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t66\n- NT17 \u2192 t66\n- NT84 \u2192 t84 (Wait, looking back, NT10 \u2192 t84? No, looking at the rules, it's NT10 \u2192 t84, but only specific rules.\n\nWait, let me go through each production:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the NTs that produce terminals are:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t84\n- NT1 \u2192 t61\n- NT6 \u2192 t20\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n- NT15 \u2192 t65\n- NT19 \u2192 t47\n- NT22 \u2192 t77\n- NT24 \u2192 t14\n- NT4 \u2192 t39? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29' and NT24 \u2192 't14'\n\nSo, NT4 \u2192 t29, NT24 \u2192 t14.\n\nAlso, NT27 can produce a terminal through other rules, like NT27 \u2192 t7 (something), but in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t72 (Wait, looking back: Wait, no. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t7 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 t66 and t73. Wait, no, actually, NT7 has two rules: NT7 \u2192 t66 and NT7 \u2192 t73.

Let me go through each production:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, each production is of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> a (terminal). So let me list all NTs and their productions:\n\n1. NT10 \u2192 t84\n2. NT1 \u2192 t61\n3. NT6 \u2192 t20\n4. NT14 \u2192 t72\n5. NT15 \u2192 t65\n6. NT19 \u2192 t47\n7. NT22 \u2192 t77\n8. NT24 \u2192 t14\n9. NT4 \u2192 t29\n10. NT27 \u2192 t72\n11.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nThe grammar consists of production rules for various non-terminals, all taking two non-terminals on the right-hand side (RHS) except possibly the start symbol. Since it's in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, and the start symbol is S. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, and I need to check if it can be derived starting from S.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the production rules and the terminals for reference. Looking through the rules, many of them produce two terminals, which must match the string's structure. Other rules, like NT1 -> 't66', are a bit simpler, producing a single 't' followed by a number.\n\nThe string is: `t84 t28 t38 t0 t35 t20 t0 t81 t35 t35 t52 t12 t23 t57 t11 t43 t14 t57 t41 t61 t18 t12 t40 t45 t14 t71 t67`.\n\nI'll approach this by trying to parse the string from the start, applying the grammar's rules step by step.

{"custom_id":"request-509","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but I'll try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form means. I think each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the provided grammar, I see all the productions are either like two non-terminals or a terminal, so that checks out.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is `t22 t38 t0 t39 t49 t0 t47 t73 t65 t49 t10 t40 t3 t11 t14 t23 t50 t52 t23 t65 t77 t65 t22 t72 t11 t77 t67`. I should parse this string and see if it can be generated by expanding the start symbol S step by step.\n\nTo start with, I know that S is the starting symbol and in Chomsky Normal Form, S must derive a string of terminals. So, let me see the production for S: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. That means S will expand into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. So, the string must start with whatever NT6 produces and be followed by whatever NT34 produces.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6 and NT34, let me list them to see their possible expansions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25.\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17 or NT41 NT50 or NT23 NT65.\n\nWait, no, looking back, actually, NT34\u2019s production is only one: NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT34 is defined as NT31 NT17, and NT31 has its own productions. So, the first step is that S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with NT6 and continues with NT34, which is NT31 NT17. So the string must start with whatever NT6 becomes, followed by NT31 NT17.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t22, t38, t0... Wait, but S is NT6 NT34, so the first term should be generated by NT6 and the second by NT34.\n\nWait, but NT34's production is NT31 NT17, so the second part will be NT31 followed by NT17. Hmm, but in the string, after t22, t38, it's t0, then t39, etc. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to simulate the parse by trying to match the string step by step. So let me try to parse the string from the start, using the productions.\n\nThe string is: t22 t38 t0 t39 t49 t0 t47 t73 t65 t49 t10 t40 t3 t11 t14 t23 t50 t52 t23 t65 t77 t65 t22 t72 t11 t77 t67.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the way the string is written. Let me count the tokens correctly. The string is a space-separated list, so each t followed by numbers is a single token. Let me list them:\n\n1: t22\n\n2: t38\n\n3: t0\n\n4: t39\n\n5: t49\n\n6: t0\n\n7: t47\n\n8: t73\n\n9: t65\n\n10: t49\n\n11: t10\n\n12: t40\n\n13: t3\n\n14: t11\n\n15: t14\n\n16: t23\n\n17: t50\n\n18: t52\n\n19: t23\n\n20: t65\n\n21: t77\n\n22: t65\n\n23: t22\n\n24: t72\n\n25: t11\n\n26: t77\n\n27: t67\n\nSo, 27 tokens in total.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17, let's see if the start of the string matches NT6 and NT34, with NT34 breaking into NT31 NT17.\n\nLooking at the first token, t22. Now, I need to see if NT6 can produce a string that starts with t22, followed by whatever NT17 produces.\n\nLooking at the NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25.\n\nEach of these further breaks down:\n\n- NT27: NT7 NT7 or others.\n\n- NT33: NT31 NT17.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting tangled. Let me check all the rules for NT6.\n\nNT6 can be:\n\n1. NT27 NT19\n\n2. NT33 NT19\n\n3. NT21 NT25\n\nSimilarly, each of these non-terminals have their own rules.\n\nSo, for the first part, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. Let's see what NT27 can produce.\n\nNT27's production: NT7 NT7 or NT12 NT18.\n\nLooking at the string, after t22 comes t38. So, if NT27 generates t22, I need to see how that's possible.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's take it one step at a time.\n\nFirst, the first token is t22, which is the result of NT6 expanding into something. So, I need to find which production of NT6 can generate a string starting with t22.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19: What does NT27 produce?\n\nNT27 has production NT7 NT7 or NT12 NT18.\n\nLooking at 't7' and 't12' as possible starts.\n\nWait, but in the string, the next token after t22 is t38. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought. NT6's production options are 1. NT27 NT19, 2. NT33 NT19, 3. NT21 NT25.\n\nLet's check these:\n\n1. NT27 NT19: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT12 NT18.\n\nLooking at NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7: NT7's production is NT77 or NT73.\n\nSo, if NT27 is broken into NT77, which is 't77', but the token after t22 is t38, which is 't38', which doesn't match NT77. Alternatively, NT77 could be 't77', but t38 isn't that.\n\nIf NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18, then NT12 can produce, for example, NT14 NT34 or other rules.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the entire string to match a possible expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if each token corresponds to the symbols in a derivation, working from the start symbols and seeing if each step matches the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a CYK parser approach, since it's a CFG in CNF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can reverse the string and use the grammar in reverse, starting from the last token and moving backward.\n\nWait, the last token is 't67'. Let me see which productions can end with 't67'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 and NT7 and NT17, etc., all have productions that end with 't66' or similar. Wait, let me see which terminals are present.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe terminals in the productions are 't22', 't38', 't0', 't39', etc. So, let me first see which non-terminals produce 't67'.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, let me see which right-hand sides end with a terminal, particularly 't67'.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65', so that's a terminal, not 't67'.\n\nNT17 \u2192 't66' and 't73'.\n\nNT22 \u2192 't72' and others.\n\nHmm, looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't67'.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT7 has two productions: NT77 and NT73. 't73' is a terminal. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't72' or 't66' or others.\n\nWait, but the last token is t67.

{"custom_id":"request-527","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This helps because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see which non-terminals produce terminals or other non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols, so I need to check if each part of the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is: `t40 t11 t30 t50 t35 t57 t57 t25 t35 t49 t38 t80 t50 t71 t38 t35 t67 t14 t49 t11 t57 t68 t71 t55 t40 t40 t72 t14`.\n\nI'll start by trying to break down the string into parts that match the grammar. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34, so the string must begin with a derivation path that starts with NT6 and NT34.\n\nLet's look at the last symbols to see if they can be matched by the grammar. The last part is ...t14, which is matched by NT14. Looking at the grammar, NT14 can be derived from NT2 and NT1. But let's backtrack.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT6 and NT34.\n\nBreaking down NT6 and NT34 into their components.\n\nNT6 can be derived from, for example, NT27 and NT19, or NT33 and NT17, or others. Similarly, NT34 is derived from NT33 and NT17, or RT22 and NT0, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT34 can produce several options. One of them is NT31 and NT17, which further can break down. Another option is NT6 and NT31, etc.\n\nThis might get complicated, so perhaps I should use a bottom-up approach, starting from the string and trying to match it back to the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, I can perform a breadth-first search (BFS) or use the CYK algorithm for parsing. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to find a derivation path.\n\nLooking at the string, each part must be covered by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's try to parse from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t40, which comes from NT14. NT14 -> NT2 and NT1.\n\nSo, the first part needs to produce t40, which is produced by NT14. So, we have NT14 -> NT2 NT1.\n\nNow, looking at NT2: according to the grammar, NT2 can be broken down into NT0 and NT20, or other options, but let's see which ones match the string.\n\nWait, the next symbol after t40 is t11. So after NT14 (t40), the next production is NT1. NT1 -> NT14 and NT28, according to the grammar. Let's check what NT14 produces.\n\nWait, butNT1 is t14? No, looking at the grammar mappings, some symbols are terminals (t's with numbers). For example, NT17 -> t66, NT14 -> t72, etc. Wait, I should construct a map of all non-terminals to their possible terminals.\n\nLet me make a list of each non-terminal and its productions:\n\n- NT14: -> NT2 NT1 | NT27 NT28 | NT22 NT21 | NT7 NT4 | NT14 NT28 | NT15 NT4 | NT27 NT19 | NT0 NT17\nWait, no, the grammar is in CNF, so each rule is two non-terminals. So for NT14, the possible productions are the rules where NT14 is on the left. Looking back, the grammar is:\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\nNT14 -> NT14 NT28\nNT14 -> NT15 NT4\netc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all the non-terminals and their possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, I can list each non-terminal and its right-hand side productions, then check which produce which terminals.\n\nBut this might take too long, but maybe I can find which terminals correspond to which NT.\n\nFrom the grammar mappings:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT17 -> t66 and t73\nNT15 -> t65\nNT10 -> t12\nNT19 -> t47\nNT22 -> t77, t38, t35, t10, t40, etc.\nWait, looking at all the NT mappings:\n\nLet me parse the grammar's rules:\n\nEach NT has multiple rules. Wait, perhaps it's better to note which NT can produce each 't'. For example:\n\n- NT0 -> 't66', 't40', 't71', etc.\n- NT1 -> 't61', 't29'\n- NT2 -> 't28', 't21', etc.\n- NT4 -> 't29', etc.\n- NT6 appears in multiple places, but I see some t's:\n  NT6 -> 't20', 't80', 't52', 't80', 't66', 't80', 't28', etc. Wait, looking at the rules:\n  NT6 is derived from:\n  NT1 -> NT14 NT28\n  NT6 can be: NT27 NT19, NT33 NT17, NT21 NT25, NT17 NT7, etc., but also directly to some terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs directly produce terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-534","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by this grammar. The string to evaluate is: `t14 t77 t80 t71 t20 t10 t12 t68 t29 t49 t3 t84 t53 t53 t10 t66 t22 t84 t71 t3 t84 t10 t72 t0 t43 t57 t30 t36`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful for parsing and for certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that the start symbol is S, and it starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Each production seems to be in CNF because each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe provided string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from S via some series of applications of the productions.\n\nTo approach this, I can model the problem as a parsing process where I need to reduce the target string from left to right using the given productions. However, doing this manually might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can find patterns or look for the structure that generates the string.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be broken down into chunks that match the production rules. Let's look at the string again: `t14 t77 t80 t71 t20 t10 t12 t68 t29 t49 t3 t84 t53 t53 t10 t66 t22 t84 t71 t3 t84 t10 t72 t0 t43 t57 t30 t36`.\n\nI'll note that in the grammar, the terminals are various strings of 't' followed by numbers. So each terminal is a single token, but in the production rules, non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either generates a terminal directly or breaks down into two non-terminals. So the string should consist of a series of such steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t14` and `t77`, then `t80`, which is a bit unusual. Let's see if `t14` can be a result of a rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1. So to get `t14`, we must find a production for NT14 that leads to `t14` directly, but according to the given grammar, NT14 is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal because it has productions. Similarly, NT77 might be a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, I don't see NT77 as a non-terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, I see that some NTs are defined, but others are not. Or perhaps in the grammar, NT77 would be a terminal if it's not further defined.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, each rule is for a non-terminal. The right-hand side consists of non-terminals or terminals as specified. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals that produce other things.\n\nI need to determine if each terminal in the string can be generated by the grammar. Additionally, I need to see if the sequence of these terminals can be formed by applying the productions step by step.\n\nStarting from the string:\n\nt14 t77 t80 t71 t20 t10 t12 t68 t29 t49 t3 t84 t53 t53 t10 t66 t22 t84 t71 t3 t84 t10 t72 t0 t43 t57 t30 t36\n\nI'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nAssuming the first two symbols come from S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So this would break the string into two parts: the part generated by NT6 and then the part generated by NT34.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nNT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the possible productions for NT6 and NT34:\n\nNT6 has several rules, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nAnd so on. It seems NT6 can produce various combinations of non-terminals.\n\nBut to see if this can produce something that leads to t14, let's check if any of the productions for NT6 can reach a terminal. Wait, no, because in all the productions for NT6, they are non-terminals. So to get t14, that must come from a terminal production. Wait, but t14 is a terminal; in the grammar, the terminals are those items in the right-hand side that are terminals because they have entries in the 'NTx -> 'line with a terminal string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are lines like:\n\nNT7 -> 't66', NT7 -> 't73', etc. So each line after NTx is a production, and some have right-hand sides that are a single terminal, others have multiple non-terminals.\n\nFor example, NT7 has two productions: NT7 -> 't66' and NT7 -> 't73'. So NT7 can produce either t66 or t73.\n\nSimilarly, NT14 has a production NT14 -> NT2 NT1, which are both non-terminals, so unless those eventually derive to terminals, it's not helpful.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first terminal is t14. So to produce t14, does any of the non-terminals have a production that ends with t14?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, none of them directly produce t14. So this suggests that t14 is a non-terminal, and thus the grammar cannot generate t14 as a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the initial rules, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S starts with non-terminals, which must be expanded to terminals. So if NT6 and NT34 eventually generate sequences that result in the given string, that's possible.\n\nBut let's think about it. The string starts with t14, which is a terminal. So if t14 is a terminal, then somewhere in the process, one of the productions must directly emit 't14' as a terminal. But in the given grammar, I don't see any NT rule that ends with 't14'. For example, looking at the list of NT productions, none end with t14. The closest is NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, but those are non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, maybe a chain of productions can lead to t14 indirectly. For instance, suppose there's a production like NTx \u2192 NT14 NTy \u2192 ... \u2192 t14. But maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps t14 is a terminal, but it's a non-terminal in the grammar, which isn't allowed. Because in Chomsky normal form, all terminals are atomic. Wait, wait, no: in a CNF grammar, some non-terminals can have productions that are a single terminal, which are like the base cases. But if a non-terminal doesn't have any rule that ends with a terminal, then it can't produce any terminal, which would make it impossible to have that non-terminal contribute to the string.\n\nSo in this case, looking at all the NT rules, none of them produce t14 as a terminal. The closest is NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, but both of those are non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the grammar cannot generate t14 as a terminal. But the string starts with t14. So that would imply that the string cannot be generated by this grammar, because the first symbol t14 is a terminal that is not produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, wait, no: looking at the grammar, at the end, for NT14, there's a line NT14 \u2192 't61', or perhaps not? Let me check.\n\nLooking again at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNT15 -> NT7 NT4\n\n...\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that has NT14 \u2192 t14 or any terminal leading to t14. So, perhaps t14 is not present as a terminal anywhere in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT14 is defined as NT2 NT1, so no terminal.\n- NT75? Wait, no, the NTs are numbered up to NT77.\n\nLooking further:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' or 't73'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar lines, there's:\n\nNT27 -> '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-545","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if this string `t68 t65 t10 t83 t65 t77 t39 t10 t35 t55 t20 t50 t38 t66 t52 t80 t81 t61 t12 t18 t72 t38 t41 t3 t23 t25 t52 t20 t80` is generated by the given grammar. First, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. Each of these non-terminals can then split into two options. I notice that each non-terminal eventually expands into a sequence of terminals. Wait, some non-terminals expand into other non-terminals, like NT14 -> NT2 NT1, so this could lead to a tree of productions until all are terminals.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Starting with S, which must become NT6 NT34. So the string must consist of two parts: one derived from NT6 and another from NT34. Let me split the string into these two parts.\n\nThe string is: t68 t65 t10 t83 t65 t77 t39 t10 t35 t55 t20 t50 t38 t66 t52 t80 t81 t61 t12 t18 t72 t38 t41 t3 t23 t25 t52 t20 t80\n\nWait, does this split neatly into two parts? Since S -> NT6 NT34, the string should be the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t68. So perhaps NT6 expands to t68, and NT34 must start with something else. But let me check all the productions for NT6. Oh, looking at NT6:\n\nNT6 has several productions. One of them is NT6 -> NT27 NT19. Another is NT6 -> NT33 NT19. Also, earlier in the list, there's NT6 -> NT27 NT19 and NT6 -> NT33 NT19. Wait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nWait, is that correct? Because in the initial part, it says S -> NT6 NT34, and then NT6 appears multiple times with different productions. Let me list all NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7 (Wait, is that correct? Looking back, the NT6 productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking through, I see NT6 has:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I think the lines under NT6 are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nAnd also:\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7? Wait, no, looking at the grammar again:\n\nWait, the lines under NT6:\nLooking through:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7? No, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the lines are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nWait, no, I don't see NT6 -> NT17 NT7. Wait, checking again.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. The user provided a long list. Let me scan for NT6 productions:\n\nYes, here are the NT6 lines:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nWait, perhaps that's all. So NT6 can expand to NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, or NT21 NT25. Wait, but in the string, the beginning is t68, which is a terminal. So if NT6 expands to a terminal directly, it must be one of the rules where the non-terminal directly goes to a terminal, but NT6's productions only go to other non-terminals, so NT6 must expand further. So t68 must be the result of expanding one of these.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nSo we need to see if the sequences starting with these non-terminals can produce t68.\n\nWait, let's look at the NT27 productions. The grammar for NT27 is:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT7 -> 't66'\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nWait, looking back, the lines under NT7 are:\n\nNT7 -> 't66'\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nAnd under NT27:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nSo, NT27 expands into two NT7s, each of which can be 't66' or 't73'. So combining these, NT27 can produce:\n\nt66 t66, t66 t73, t73 t66, t73 t73.\n\nBut in the string, we have a t68 early on. So unless t68 is derived from some other path, but I don't see NT27 leading to t68. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong NT6 productions. Let me re-examine the grammar for NT6. Maybe I missed another production where NT6 goes directly to a terminal. Scanning through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all NT6 lines:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a long list. Let me see:\n\nThe lines include:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7? Wait, checking again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the lines under NT6 are:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7? No, I don't think so. Wait, in the initial part I thought I saw NT6 -> NT17 NT7 but now I see it's not there. So perhaps NT6 only expands to other non-terminals.\n\nSo, since the initial part of the string is t68, which is a terminal, that must come from a production that eventually ends in a terminal. So let's see where t68 comes from. Looking at all the terminals, I see that for NT2 (which is not a non-terminal, wait, no, in the grammar, NT2 is a non-terminal. Let me check the productions for NT2:\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT2:\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT20\nNT2 -> NT20\nNT2 -> 't0'\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nWait, under NT2, there's production NT2 -> 't0' and 't28'. So perhaps NT2 can produce these terminals. But in the string, after t68, the next is t65. Let's see if NT6 can lead to t68 followed by other terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to explore the entire parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to construct the parse tree starting from S and see if the string can be matched.\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nSo the string must start with the expansion of NT6 and then NT34.\n\nThe first part of the string is t68, which is a terminal. So in NT6's expansion, t68 must be one of the ends.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two other symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. \n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t20 t71 t80 t80 t80 t66 t28 t43 t50 t11 t50 t84 t57 t36 t57 t72 t29 t68 t11 t43 t20 t43 t53 t20 t29 t77 t45 t50 t45`.\n\nThat's 30 tokens, so the string has 30 symbols. I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34. Both are non-terminals, so the first step is to expand those. Let me see what NT6 and NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT6 has multiple productions:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT22 NT25\nNT6 -> NT21 NT29 (wait, this seems like a duplication but perhaps it's a mistake. Wait, the rules list under NT6 says:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT22 NT25\nNT6 -> NT21 NT29\nSo there are multiple possibilities for NT6.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 can be expanded. Looking at NT34's rules:\n\nNT34 -> 't3'\n\nSo NT34 is a terminal symbol that directly becomes 't3'. So in the string, if it's generating 't34', that's not matching since '34' isn't a terminal; wait, wait\u2014looking back, the strings are made of 't' followed by numbers. So NT34 is 't34'? Or is it a terminal that maps to 't3'?\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT34 has a production NT34 -> 't3', so yeah, NT34 is a terminal that produces the string 't3'. So in our input string, if the parser outputs 't3', that's correct.\n\nBut our input string has a lot of 't's followed by numbers. Let me parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting from the first token, which is 't20'. But the grammar doesn't have a terminal 't20' except for the NT2 rule, which is NT2 -> 't28'. Wait, but there's also NT0 -> 't66', NT1 -> 't61', and so on. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should first write down all the terminal symbols. Let me see:\n\nFrom the rules, the terminals are:\nt77, t47, t65, t22, t12, t14, t11, t53, t10, t14, t11, t18, t53, t22, t38, t3, t55, t10, t45, t66, t28, t21, t29, t72, t43, t50, t11 (maybe more). Let me list all unique terminals:\n\nt3, t7, t10, t11, t12, t14, t18, t20, t21, t22, t25, t27, t28, t29, t31, t33, t34, t35, t36, t37, t40, t43, t45, t47, t50, t53, t55, t57, t65, t66, t67, t72, t73, t77, t80, t84, t90, t93, t95, t99.\n\nWait, the input string is: t20 t71 t80 t80 t80 t66 t28 t43 t50 t11 t50 t84 t57 t36 t57 t72 t29 t68 t11 t43 t20 t43 t53 t20 t29 t77 t45 t50 t45\n\nWait, I notice that in the string, there's a 't71'. But looking at the grammar, none of the productions end with NT71. So that's a red flag. So the grammar doesn't have a non-terminal NT71 that produces 't71'. So how can the input string have 't71'?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, none of the NTs seem to produce 't71'. Let me check the provided rules again. The rules are all within NT1 to NT99 and T's, so perhaps 't71' is not present.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, after NT22 -> 't22', NT4 -> 't29', etc. I don't see a production that leads to 't71'. So that means that the string has a token 't71' which is not produced by any of the NTs in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it includes a symbol that's not part of the grammar's terminals.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NTs. Hmm, NT71 is not in the list provided, and all non-terminals in the grammar end with NT1 to NT34, etc., like NT6, NT14, NT20, NT22, NT24, NT25, NT27, etc., but I don't see NT71. So 't71' is a terminal, and since there's no NT that can produce 't71', the string cannot be generated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-550","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens like 't43', 't53', etc. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal and B, C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of non-terminals (like S, NT14, NT20, etc.) and some terminals starting with 't'. Each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for some which are directly assigned a single terminal. Wait, no, actually Chomsky Normal Form allows productions to the left-hand side (LHS) to have two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals. So each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a.\n\nBut in this grammar, some rules have a single terminal, like NT10 -> 't77', which would mean that NT10 can produce that string, which is just a single 't77' token. So each non-terminal can produce a terminal, which can be one token, or a pair of non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, I'll need to see how the string is built up. The string given is a sequence of terminal symbols, all starting with 't', so the terminals are things like t43, t53, etc. So each of these must be generated by some non-terminal's production.\n\nLet me start by looking at the top-level production: S -> NT6 NT34. So S generates a string that starts with NT6 followed by NT34. Each NT may produce a terminal or a combination.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string backward, trying to see if I can derive it from the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to see if each part can be matched to some production. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, maybe I can construct a parse tree for the string and see if it's valid. But I'm not sure how to do that without more detailed steps.\n\nLet me first see if I can split the string into parts that match the production rules.\n\nThe string is: t43 t53 t45 t40 t67 t12 t12 t83 t57 t43 t61 t35 t68 t47 t28 t45 t40 t50 t68 t11 t50 t39 t80 t80 t61 t72 t41 t49 t29 t49\n\nWait, that's pretty long. Let me count the number of tokens: it's 31 tokens. So the string has 31 terminal symbols.\n\nLet's see: each NT production either produces two non-terminals or one terminal. So the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree should lead to 31 terminals. Let me think about the structure.\n\nEach production in the grammar creates a string by combining two non-terminals. So for example, S -> NT6 NT34, so when NT6 and NT34 both produce terminals, the S production will yield two terminals. Similarly, if NT6 and NT34 each produce non-terminals, then each of those can produce strings, so S would result in their concatenation.\n\nBut for the string to be possible, the entire sequence must be a concatenation that follows the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a context-free grammar where each rule can generate either a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in a grammar, each production is of the form A -> some string. So each rule corresponds to a possible way to produce a part of the string.\n\nLet me try to look at each production and see where a 't' token comes from.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT10 -> 't77' \u2192 produces 't77'\nNT15 -> 't65' \u2192 't65'\nNT19 -> 't47' \u2192 't47'\nNT22 -> 't77' \u2192 which is same as NT10, so 't77'\nNT1 -> 't61' \u2192 't61'\nNT6 -> 't20' \u2192 't20'\nNT27 -> 't72' \u2192 't72'\nNT4 \u2192 't29' and 't36' (wait, some have multiple rules, like NT4: 't29' and 't36')\nWait, looking again, some non-terminals have multiple production rules. For example:\n\nNT27 -> 't72' and also NT21 -> 't81' and NT21 -> 't29'. Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe some symbols have multiple possible terminal outputs, but in this case, each production that's a terminal is specific.\n\nLet me make a list of terminals each non-terminal can produce.\n\nStarting from the leaves:\n\nNT10 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't65'\nNT19 -> 't47'\nNT22 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT6 -> 't20' (but there's another rule for NT6: -> NT27 NT19, which is 2 non-terminals.\nNT27 -> 't72'\nNT21 -> 't37' (only one production)\nWait, but looking back, I think I see that some non-terminals have both single and two-symbol productions, but perhaps some have multiple single productions.\n\nWait, for example, NT1 has NT14 NT28 as one rule, and NT1 -> 't61' as another. Similarly, NT27 has two production rules: NT7 NT7 and 't72'. Wait, no: NT27 has two rules: NT7 NT7 and NT7 NT7 again?\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps both rules are the same. Alternatively, maybe I misread. Looking back, the production for NT27 is:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nAnd that's it. So NT27 can only produce two NT7's.\n\nHmm, proceeding.\n\nLet me check each production and see which non-terminals can directly produce each token in the string.\n\nFor example, 't43' occurs twice. So where does 't43' come from? Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT31 -> 't43' (as per the third bullet point)\nNT22 -> 't43' (another production)\n\nWait, let's check the given productions:\n\nAt one point:\n\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17\nNT15 -> 't65'\nNT22 -> 't77' (so that's 't77')\nWait, in the list above, looking for 't43':\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\nNT31 -> 't43' (appears twice)\nNT22 -> 't43' (appears once)\n\nSo 't43' can be produced by NT31 or NT22.\n\nSimilarly, 't53' is in the string. Looking for where 't53' comes from. Checking the productions, I don't see 't53' directly, but maybe through a non-terminal that can produce it. Wait, does any non-terminal have a direct production for 't53'? Let me scan:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT10: t77\nNT15:65\nNT19:47\nNT22:77 and 43\nNT1:61\nNT6:20, 31 (since NT6 has two rules: NT27 NT19 and 't20')\nWait, looking back, for NT6, the productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo 't20' is an option. But in this case, the string has 't43' and 't53' as tokens. Let me check if any non-terminal produces 't53' directly.\n\nLooking for 't53':\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT directly being 't53'. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me re-examine the productions given by the user:\n\nHere's the full list of productions again for clarity (only the terminal parts):\n\nNT10 -> 't77'\nNT15 -> 't65'\nNT19 -> 't47'\nNT22 -> 't77'\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT6 -> 't20'\nNT1 -> 't29' (Wait, does NT1 have multiple rules? Let's check again.)\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nThe productions include:\n\nNT6 -> 't61' and NT6 -> 't20'?\nWait, no, in the initial list, under NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nWait, that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, in the grammar, I see NT6 has the rule NT6 \u2192 NT20 NT19. Oh, right, so NT6 is composed of NT20 and NT19.\n\nWait, let's list the steps. First, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So after S, the next tokens should be from NT6 and then NT34.\n\nSo looking at NT6: NT6 produces either NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, or others... But the end symbols are 't20', 't21', etc. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT20 NT21? Wait, checking the grammar, there's NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 and NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, but also NT6 has a production to 't20' (from NT1). Wait, wait, no: looking at the production rules, some NT rules have terminal symbols as their options. For instance, NT1 \u2192 't61', NT6 \u2192 't20' (NT6 \u2192 't20' is one rule: yes, at the end, NT6 \u2192 't20').\n\nWait, the grammar has multiple NT terminals pointing to specific 't's. So I think I can map each NT to the possible 't' symbols it can expand into.\n\nGiven that, let's list each NT and what terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\/'t29'\/'t14'\/'t11'\/'t27'\/'t66'\/'t77'\/'t14'\/'t11' etc. Wait, no: each rule has specific terminals.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each non-terminal on the left side expands to two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. My string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t36 t50 t53 t71 t14 t67 t30 t25 t57 t65 t47 t61 t65 t71 t29 t29 t38 t28 t68 t45 t45 t35 t37 t68 t38 t66 t12 t54 t65 t22 t54.\n\nSince it's a context-free grammar, I need to see if this string can be derived by applying the productions step by step, starting from the start symbol S and working my way down to the terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S starts as NT6 NT34. Each of these can be terminals or non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals. Let me try to parse the string starting from the first symbol.\n\nThe string starts with t36, so I look at the productions for symbols matching t36. In the grammar, NT4 \u2192 t29, NT21 \u2192 t37, and NT25 \u2192 t49 or t57. Wait, but t36 isn't directly listed except in some cases. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking at NT25: NT25 \u2192 t49 or NT57, but t36 isn't directly an output of any non-terminal except maybe via intermediate steps.

Looking through the list of productions, I see:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t49, t57\n- NT21 \u2192 t37\n- NT4 \u2192 t29\n- NT27 \u2192 t72, t73, t80 (since NT7 can be t66 or t73)\n- NT22 \u2192 t25, t38, t77\n- NT20 \u2192 t45, t66\n- NT17 \u2192 t66\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n- NT19 \u2192 t47, t54, t77\n- NT6 \u2192 various, including t20, t33, t56, etc.\n- NT1 \u2192 t29, various others.\n- Others: looking for t36, it appears only in NT21's production as t37 and NT25's t49, t57, and NT4 as t29, etc.\n\nWait, but my string starts with t36. So I'm looking for a production that starts the expansion with t36. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT where t36 is directly produced.

So does that mean the string starts with t36, but no NT in the grammar can produce t36 as the first symbol? If that's the case, the string can't be generated because there's no way to start with t36.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've overlooked a non-terminal that can expand to t36. Let me check all the NTs again.\n\nLooking at NT25: \u2192 NT24 NT5, NT26, NT47, etc. Hmm, but t36 is a terminal, so maybe through the right steps, but I don't see a direct production for t36. So, perhaps the first symbol t36 can't be derived from any of the NTs.\n\nWait, unless I made a mistake in reading. Let me check the rules again carefully.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t29, t39\n- NT15 \u2192 t65, t73\n- NT21 \u2192 t37\n- NT22 \u2192 t25, t38, t77\n- NT24 \u2192 t14\n- NT25 \u2192 t49, t57\n- NT27 \u2192 t72, t73, t80\n- NT10 \u2192 t14, various\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n- NT19 \u2192 t47, t54, t77\n- NT6 \u2192 various, but not t36\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT31 \u2192 t35, t43, t57\n- Others don't seem to produce t36.\n  \nSo, it seems that none of the NTs directly produce t36.

Let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule starts with a non-terminal on the left and has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing, although since we're just trying to generate the string, maybe we can find another approach.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t28 t12 t45 t11 t10 t3 t23 t30 t30 t14 t23 t14 t23 t49 t55 t36 t28 t28 t30 t73 t61 t71 t71 t37 t20 t61 t81 t77 t61 t61 t23`.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several non-terminals that produce terminal symbols, like NT10 -> 't12', NT2 -> 't28', etc. Some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, which suggests that we'll need to substitute these in steps.\n\nSince the string is a series of terminal symbols, our approach will involve replacing the non-terminals in the grammar with the correct terminals and seeing if the entire string can be constructed that way.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which is defined as NT6 NT34. So the string should start with the productions of NT6 and NT34. Let's check the productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT19 -> 't47' (so ending here gives us 't47')\n\nBut wait, NT6 also has another production: NT6 -> NT33 NT19, and another: NT6 -> NT21 NT25. So let me see. We need to see how NT6 and NT34 break down.\n\nWait, the string starts with t28, which is the result of NT2 producing t28. Let me check the productions for NT2:\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT20\nNT0 -> 't66'\nNT20 -> NT45\n\nLooking at NT45: I don't see an NT45 in the grammar, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the given grammar has NT14 -> 't72', NT20 -> 't45', etc. Wait, actually, looking again:\n\nNT20->'t45' is correct. Because in the grammar list, under other non-terminals, I see NT20 -> NT45, but wait no, actually checking the provided grammar, the NT20 is written as NT20 -> NT45. But in the given string, there's t45, which is the terminal output when NT20 produces it. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar says NT20 -> NT45. Hmm, but in the given terminal string, there's t45. So that suggests that somewhere in the derivation, we have NT20 producing 't45'.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I see NT20->'t45' under which entries? Let me scan the grammar:\n\nYes, there's NT20 -> 't45' listed. So NT20 can directly produce 't45'. That must be part of the derivation.\n\nSo starting from S: NT6 NT34.\n\nFirst, NT6: Let's see. The possible productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT27 could break down into NT7 NT7 (since there's NT17 -> NT7 NT7, but no, wait. Let me check NT27:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT27 has two productions:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nand \n\nNT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, but in the initial breakdown, I think NT27 is part of NT6's rule. So let's try to parse step by step.\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Perhaps a better way is to work backwards from the string, applying the grammar rules in reverse to see if we can reduce the string to S.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's try to construct the string step by step, ensuring that each part of the string corresponds to symbols in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the entire string for clarity: t28 t12 t45 t11 t10 t3 t23 t30 t30 t14 t23 t14 t23 t49 t55 t36 t28 t28 t30 t73 t61 t71 t71 t37 t20 t61 t81 t77 t61 t61 t23.\n\nLooking for the first symbol, t28. So which non-terminals produce t28? Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nSo the first part could be coming from NT2. But the starting symbol is S, which is NT6 NT34. So maybe S is supposed to be a two-part string, and the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo perhaps the string is a combination of two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nLet's first see if S can produce the string by splitting into two parts.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be generated by the grammar, following the production rules.\n\nLet me try to map each terminal in the string to a possible non-terminal.\n\nFirst, t28. Looking for terminals and seeing which NT produce them.\n\nI see:\n\nNT2 -> 't28' (so production 1)\n\nNT27 -> 't73', 't66'\n\nNT7 -> 't66', 't73'\n\nNT17-> 't66', 't72', 't73'\n\nNT6 -> 't80', 't20', 't37', etc.\n\nBut let's see: t28 is 't28', which is only produced by NT2.\n\nBut S is NT6 NT34, not NT2.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the starting point is S, which branches into NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo let's look at the first symbol, t28. If NT6 can produce 't28', then maybe the first part of the string comes from NT6.\n\nWait, no. NT6 has productions that end in non-terminals, like NT27 NT19, and nt19 is NT19->'t47', which is a terminal. So starting from NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nWhich would give NT27 and 't47'. So the first part would be the output of NT27 followed by 't47'.\n\nBut 't28' is not 't47'. So perhaps the first symbol t28 doesn't come from NT6's initial productions. Alternatively, maybe we should be looking for a way to get 't28' from another path, but since NT2 is a single non-terminal, perhaps we need to find where t28 comes from elsewhere.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is the concatenation of the derivations from S, which is NT6 and NT34. So perhaps the string should be split into two parts, one from NT6 and one from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is t23, which is 't23'. Let's look for which non-terminals produce t23.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT11 -> 't11', so that's a terminal.\n\nNT19 -> 't47' (fixed)\n\nLooking further, I don't see a direct terminal for t23. Wait, I see NT19 -> 't47', but maybe there's another production I missed. Let me scan:\n\nLooking at NT11: NT11->'t11'\n\nNT15->'t65'\n\nNT22->'t77'\n\nNT2->'t28'\n\nNT6->'t20'\n\nNT1->'t61'\n\nWait, in the later productions, I see NT23 being used as a terminal, perhaps. Wait, no, looking carefully:\n\nWait, looking through the list, I don't see an NT23 with a terminal, except if someone wrote it as part of a production. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking for any NT that produce 't23':\n\nWait, perhaps NT22 -> 't77' and other terms, but none directly.\n\nWait, perhaps NT23 is a non-terminal and doesn't produce a terminal. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't23' as a terminal. So perhaps the string contains a 't23', which isn't possible, implying that the string is invalid.\n\nWait, that can't be, because then we would immediately say 'No'. But maybe I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-582","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production has two non-terminals or a terminal. Looking through the rules, I see that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, which are all the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT6 and NT34. So the string must start by expanding S into NT6 NT34. That means the first parts of the string will come from NT6 and NT34. Let me note that down.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't3'. Where does 't3' come from? Checking the grammar, NT34 goes to 't3' directly. So that's good. The first part is handled by NT34, which is 't3'.\n\nNow, the rest of the string after 't3' is 't61 t22 t81 t67 t18 t3 t30 t67 t25 t30 t40 t23 t41 t36 t3 t68 t28 t18 t80 t40 t29 t49 t41 t39 t39 t22 t43 t80 t25 t40 t22'.\n\nWait, but S splits into NT6 and NT34. So the string needs to be built as NT6 leads to some sequence and NT34 leads to 't3'. So after 't3', the next part should come from NT6.\n\nLet me parse the next part: after 't3', the next token is 't61'. Where is 't61' coming from? Looking at NT6 rules, I see NT6 can go to 't20' directly. But 't61' is another terminal. Let me check if NT6 can produce 't61' elsewhere.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT1 goes to 't66', NT14 to 't72', NT10 to 't12' and 't84', NT1 goes to 't61'. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, I see NT1 is 't61'. So possibly, NT6 can go to NT1, which is 't61'. So yes, that works.\n\nWait, checking the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT80 (Wait, no, in the given grammar, NT6 has several productions, but I don't see NT6 directly going to 't61'. Instead, NT1 directly goes to 't61'. So how does NT6 become 't61'?\n\nWait, perhaps through a chain. Let me re-examine NT6. NT6 has productions, but I don't see any terminal except through another non-terminal. For example, NT6 can go to NT27 NT19, and so on.\n\nBut since the string's next token after 't3' is 't61', and from NT6, I don't see any direct rule that gives 't61'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps there's a path through the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe entire string is: t3 t61 t22 t81 t67 t18 t3 t30 t67 t25 t30 t40 t23 t41 t36 t3 t68 t28 t18 t80 t40 t29 t49 t41 t39 t39 t22 t43 t80 t25 t40 t22.\n\nSince S is NT6 NT34, let's split the string into two parts: one generated by NT6 and the other by NT34. NT34 directly produces 't3', which is the first token 't3', so that part is matched.\n\nNow, the next part of the string should be generated by NT6. So starting with 't61', let me see:\n\nNT6 can go to NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT21 NT25, NT17 NT7, NT80, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I think NT6 is 't61' because looking at the initial list, there's a NT1 -> 't61'. So perhaps NT6 can be NT1, which gives 't61'.\n\nSo the second token is 't61' from NT1.\n\nFrom NT1, what can we do? The grammar says NT1 -> NT14 NT28. So NT1 needs to expand into NT14 and NT28.\n\nThe third token after NT6's 't61' is 't22' from NT22. So after 't61' comes 't22'. So after 't61', the next token is 't22'.\n\nSo after producing NT1 as 't61', we need to expand NT14 and NT28.\n\nLooking at NT14, it goes to NT2 NT1. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.\n\nWait, let me think about how the parsing would work. The string starts with 't3' (NT34), then 't61' (NT1), then 't22', etc.\n\nLet me try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo first, NT34 produces 't3'. Then, we need to process the rest of the string starting after 't3', which is 't61 t22 ...'.\n\nSo we're left with processing the part generated by NT6, which must start with 't61'.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT6, there are several options:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT6? No, seems direct productions only if there's a terminal. Wait, no, in the initial list, I think NT6 can go to 't20' via NT17 NT7? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, in the initial list, looking for NT6, I see:\n\nNT6->NT27 NT19\nNT6->NT33 NT19\nNT6->NT21 NT25\nNT6->NT17 NT7\nNT6->NT6? No, I don't see that. Wait, no, in the given grammar, I think NT6 can only produce combinations of non-terminals, not terminals. Therefore, the 't61' must be produced by some NT that eventually goes to a terminal. So for that, we might have NT1 giving 't61'.\n\nSo maybe S->NT6 NT34 becomes:\n\nNT6 generates 't61' via some chain, and NT34 generates 't3' directly.\n\nLet me focus on NT6 now. Starting after 't3', the next token is 't61', so we have to find a way for NT6 to produce that.\n\nLooking again at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nSo none of these are terminals. Therefore, the only way 't61' can come out from NT6 is if it goes through a chain where one of these non-terminals eventually produce a terminal.\n\nSo let's explore each possibility.\n\n1. Let's see if starting with NT6->NT27 NT19 can eventually produce 't61'.\n\nLooking at NT27:\n\nNT27 can go to NT7 NT7, or NT2 NT18, or NT38 via other paths? Wait, looking at NT27's productions:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, let me check. The list includes:\n\nNT12-> NT14 NT0\nWait, no, for NT27:\nNT27-> NT7 NT7\nWait, no, looking at the initial list, NT27's rules include:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, no, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nand\nNT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, but the given list doesn't have NT27 being a terminal. So how does 't61' get into NT6? Alternatively, maybe NT1 gives 't61', so perhaps NT6 can go to NT1, which is a direct production.\n\nWait, I think in the initial list, NT1 is a non-terminal with 't61' as its production. So perhaps NT6 can go to NT1?

So, the string must be split into two parts, the first generated by NT6 and the second by NT34.\n\nSo the initial step is to check if the string can be split into two parts: part1 and part2, where part1 starts with the symbols generated by NT6 and part2 starts with NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t67. So, does NT6 produce t67 directly? Looking at NT6's productions, none of the rules seem to produce t67 directly. Because NT6's rules are all about combining two NTs, and none have a terminal.\n\nWait, but maybe through NTs. For example, perhaps NT6 can expand into a sequence that includes the symbol t67. So, maybe I need to see if the production for NT6 can generate t67 through expansions.\n\nLooking deeper, let's consider the productions for NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nOther rules for NT6?

Let me check:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some lines. For example, under NT6, is the rule NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25? Yes, I see that line. So, NT6 has several rules, each expanding into two NTs.\n\nSo, in order to get t67, perhaps a production chain exists where NT6 eventually produces t67 through NTs.\n\nLooking at the productions, perhaps I need to trace from NT6 to NTs that produce t67.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce t67, we can see from the grammar that NT7 \u2192 t66 and t73.

{"custom_id":"request-587","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. That should make things a bit easier because I know each step in the derivation will involve producing two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string we need to evaluate: \n\nt39 t18 t49 t65 t61 t40 t65 t38 t37 t37 t65 t55 t54 t50 t66 t53 t25 t71 t53 t55 t83 t55 t49 t43 t52 t49 t53 t68 t0 t57 t53 t50 t43.\n\nThat's quite a long string. Okay, so each symbol here is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Some of them are definitely terminals, like t39, t18, etc., while others like S, NT14, NT20, etc., are non-terminals. But in this string, all the elements seem to be terminals except N? Maybe the N is just part of the string labels?\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the string was generated by some formatting issue. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar's non-terminals are all names like S, NT14, etc., while the terminals are things like t39, t49, etc. So the string provided is a sequence of terminals, so the question is whether this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nSo, the task is to parse the string according to the grammar, ensuring that each step of the derivation matches the productions.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree will be a binary tree, and the string will have length equal to 2^n, where n is the number of productions. Wait, but let's count the number of symbols in the string. Let me count them: \n\n1 t39, 2 t18, 3 t49, 4 t65, 5 t61, 6 t40, 7 t65, 8 t38, 9 t37, 10 t37, 11 t65, 12 t55, 13 t54, 14 t50, 15 t66, 16 t53, 17 t25, 18 t71, 19 t53, 20 t55, 21 t83, 22 t55, 23 t49, 24 t43, 25 t52, 26 t49, 27 t53, 28 t68, 29 t0, 30 t57, 31 t53, 32 t50, 33 t43.\n\nWait, that's 33 symbols. Hmm, but with each production in CNF producing two symbols, the length of the string should be 2^n where n is the number of productions. Let's see: 2^5=32, 2^6=64, so 33 doesn't fit. That might be a problem because the string length doesn't fit the expected number for a binary tree derivation. Maybe I did the count wrong.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1. t39\n2. t18\n3. t49\n4. t65\n5. t61\n6. t40\n7. t65\n8. t38\n9. t37\n10. t37\n11. t65\n12. t55\n13. t54\n14. t50\n15. t66\n16. t53\n17. t25\n18. t71\n19. t53\n20. t55\n21. t83\n22. t55\n23. t49\n24. t43\n25. t52\n26. t49\n27. t53\n28. t68\n29. t0\n30. t57\n31. t53\n32. t50\n33. t43.\n\nYes, that's 33 symbols. So the possible problem is that the string's length isn't a power of two. Chomsky Normal Form for a context-free grammar leads to parse trees with height log2(n), so the string length should be 2^n where n is the number of levels. 33 isn't a power of two, so maybe the string isn't in the language. But 32 is the nearest power of two, and 33 is one more than 32. So perhaps it can't be derived.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to approach it differently. Maybe the start symbol S, which starts as NT6 NT34. Each of these could be a separate component. Let's see what each of these are.\n\nLooking up the productions:\n\nNT6 has two possible productions:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nSo S starts as NT6 NT34, which can combine these.\n\nLet me see NT34's productions:\n- NT34 -> 't3' (terminal)\n- NT34 -> 't50' (terminal)\n\nSo S = NT6 NT34, which can be either:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 followed by 't3' or\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19 followed by 't50'\n\nWait, no, because S is a non-terminal that produces NT6 NT34. Since both are non-terminals, we can expand them one step. Let me see:\n\nWait, more accurately, S is NT6 NT34, which is two non-terminals. Each would expand, leading to a four-step process.\n\nBut wait, the string is t39 t18..., so perhaps each step produces a terminal, but that would require all the non-terminals to expand in a way that the terminals line up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from S, and trying to expand step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is structured, maybe I can try to work backwards from the string and see if it can be reduced to S using the reverse of the productions.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string step by step.\n\nLet's try to process the string:\n\nThe string is:\nt39, t18, t49, t65, t61, t40, t65, t38, t37, t37, t65, t55, t54, t50, t66, t53, t25, t71, t53, t55, t83, t55, t49, t43, t52, t49, t53, t68, t0, t57, t53, t50, t43.\n\nSo, let's start by considering the entire string and trying to split it into pairs according to the grammar rules.\n\nWait, since the grammar uses NTx -> NTy NTz, each application adds two symbols. So the initial S is two non-terminals, so in the expansion, each step adds either a terminal or another non-terminal, and so on.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split into the right components according to the grammar.\n\nBut perhaps this is too involved. Given that the string length is 33, which isn't a power of two, it's impossible because the derivation starts with two symbols and each step replaces each non-terminal with two, hence the length after n steps is 2^{n+1}, but here 33 isn't such a number. Wait, actually, S is a single non-terminal that becomes two non-terminals, and each can produce either two more non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the initial expansion from S is one step, but each non-terminal production can either introduce terminals or new non-terminals, leading to the string length being such that it's 2^n, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully.\n\nThe Chomsky Normal Form rules mean that each non-terminal A -> BC, which are two symbols, either both non-terminals or both terminals, but wait, no, in CNF, each production is A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A -> a where a is a terminal. So in the initial step, the entire string is one non-terminal and eventually becomes multiple terminals, each production either adding one terminal or expanding into two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that each production either introduces a terminal or splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals. Therefore, the string length must be such that it's a sum where each step can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me see if any NT6 production can lead to these.\n\nWait, actually, in the NT6 rules, I see:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19: so NT27 and NT19.\nBut wait, under NT19, looking at the grammar, the production is NT19->'t47' or 't23'.

So the production is NT6 NT34, but NT6 and NT34 are variables, so their expansions would produce the first two symbols (if they're terminals) or further variables.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t22, then t23, etc., so let's see if these can come from NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, the first two symbols are t22 and t23.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes it a bit easier to handle with parsers or through derivations. The string to check is a sequence of tokens, and each token must be derived from the non-terminals step by step.\n\nFirst, I should write down the string again to make sure I have it correctly: t68, t81, t72, t83, t38, t45, t28, t68, t10, t20, t53, t39, t49, t55, t39, t55, t43, t49, t67, t14, t71, t20, t43, t84, t20, t35, t80, t43, t43, t55, t10, t67, t36, t30.\n\nI know that the grammar's non-terminals start with S, so the first symbol in the string should be derived from S. Let me look at the production for S: S -> NT6 NT34. So, S expands into NT6 and NT34. That means the first step is to see if the first part of the string can be generated by NT6, and the second part by NT34.\n\nLooking at the first token, t68. I need to find a production for NT6 that can derive t68. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT1 -> 't61' and a few others, but looking for t68.\n\nWait a minute, in the provided grammar, the rule NT6->t68 is not directly present. So, let me see where t68 comes from. Looking through the NT6 rules, I don't see any that produce t68 directly. Hmm, maybe I should check if any other production of NT6 can lead to t68.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the entire NT6 productions again:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT1 -> 't61'\n- Some other NT6 rules that produce t20, t27, t33, t52, t54, etc., but none produce t68.\n\nSo t68 must come from one of the non-terminals that derive to it. Let me see if any non-terminals produce t68. Looking through the rules, NT0, NT2, NT1, etc., produce various tokens. Let me check NT35: no, NT35 is used but not producing t68. Looking for 't68' in any production of a non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the string, after t68, it's t81, t72, t83, etc. Maybe I should consider the derivation of each symbol step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the string starts with t68, but in the grammar, no production of a non-terminal directly gives t68. So to have t68 as the first symbol, there must be a production where Nt6 or something else can produce t68. But looking through the rules, I don't see any NT6, NT1, etc., that produce t68.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for where t68 comes from further in the string. Let me see, the tokens are t68, t81, t72, t83, t38, t45, t28, t68, t10, t20, t53, t39, t49, t55, t39, t55, t43, t49, t67, t14, t71, t20, t43, t84, t20, t35, t80, t43, t43, t55, t10, t67, t36, t30.\n\nWait, maybe the first t68 is from a production that requires multiple steps. Let me think: S -> NT6 NT34. So NT6 needs to derive t68, which would require some production chain.\n\nWait, looking at the first symbol t68. Let's see what NT6 can do.\n\nLooking back, the production for NT6 is:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT1 -> 't61' (but that gives t61, not t68)\n- Also, other NT6 rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps I overlooked a production. Let me re-examine all NT6 production rules.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n5. NT6 -> NT1 -> 't61' (but maybe more?)\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I don't see any NT6 productions that produce t68 directly, and I'm not sure if t68 is a terminal or part of a non-terminal. But in the string, t68 is a terminal symbol, so it must be derived directly from a production of a non-terminal that gives it as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, which non-terminals produce t68 as a terminal? None of them seem to, because NT6's production doesn't include t68. So that suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the first symbol can't be derived.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed something. Let me scan all the production rules again.\n\nLooking at the end of the provided rules:\n\nLooking at NT6, the rules are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nNT6 -> NT1 -> 't61'\n\nAnd after that, it seems there are more rules, perhaps ending with other productions. Wait, looking further down, I see:\n\nNT22 -> t66, t28, etc. Wait, let me make sure I scan all the rules.\n\nWait, actually, the rules are listed, so let me list all the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6-> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6-> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6-> NT21 NT25\n\nNT6-> NT17 NT7\n\nNT6-> NT1 -> 't61'\n\nNT6-> NT6 -> t52 (Wait, no, probably not; perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for any other NT6 rules.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, the list of production rules is very long, but I need to find if any NT6 production results in 't68'. Let me check each production:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19: So NT27 and NT19. Both of these are non-terminals. So need to expand them.\n\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19: Same logic.\n\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25: NT21 and NT25.\n\n4. NT6 -> NT17 NT7: NT17 and NT7.\n\n5. NT6 -> NT1 -> 't61': So this is NT1 producing 't61'.\n\n6. Any others? Let's see further down the rules:\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 -> 't73' directly. So if I follow that path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me build the parse tree for the string step by step, keeping track of each symbol and their possible derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since the first token is t68, and no NT6 production directly provides t68, it's impossible to derive t68 from NT6, meaning the entire string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut before jumping to that conclusion, I should confirm if there's any non-terminal which can produce t68 in one step. From the list, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t68, as per the '->' rules, only specific terminals are produced. So unless t68 is the output of a production, which it doesn't seem to be, this string's first symbol might not be derivable.\n\nTherefore, my initial thought is that the string can't be generated because the first symbol t68 isn't an output of any production in the grammar. So the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the non-terminal NT0 or another can expand into t68 through a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-602","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal symbol on the left (like S, NT14, etc.) expands into two other non-terminals on the right. The grammar is provided in a list, but it's a bit dense. I need to parse it carefully.\n\nLooking at the string I need to evaluate: `t3 t84 t36 t30 t3 t53 t68 t54 t68 t68 t30 t73 t55 t23 t41 t57 t84 t22 t61 t77 t81 t53 t61 t43 t41 t52 t71 t61 t20 t25 t80 t66 t39 t81`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is likely a terminal symbol representing that specific string. So, I need to see if the derivation of this string can be made using the grammar's rules.\n\nI'll start by identifying the order of the symbols. The start symbol in the grammar is S, which expands into NT6 and NT34. So the first step is to see if the string starts with t3 or t84, which would correspond to NT34 or another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT34 can produce certain combinations. Wait, actually, the first production is S -> NT6 NT34. So S produces two non-terminals, and the string starts with t3. Hmm, that suggests the string might start with a terminal, but the first production from S requires two non-terminals. That might mean the first non-terminal produces t3, but wait, in the string, the first token is t3, which is a single terminal. So perhaps the first derivation would have S -> NT6 NT34, and then each NT could expand further.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look for the non-terminals that produce t3, t84, etc. Let me go through the productions to see which NT can produce each terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT34 -> 't3' (so NT34 can produce 't3')\n- NT7 -> 't66' and 't73'\n- NT6 -> 't20', 't39', etc.\n- NT14 -> 't72', which is a production\n- NT4 -> 't29', etc.\n\nSo, 't3' is directly produced by NT34. So that's good.\n\nThe string starts with t3, which is produced by NT34. Now, looking at S's production: S -> NT6 NT34. So to get the first symbol t3, which is NT34, I need to derive nt34 from something. Wait, actually, the production S -> NT6 NT34 is how S is produced, so the entire string should be generated by expanding S into NT6 and NT34, and then each of those NTs expand into sequences that generate the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but the string is a single sequence of terminals. So perhaps the entire string should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34 derived from S.\n\nSo, perhaps the string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 followed by the expansion of NT34.\n\nBut the string is quite long, so maybe it's better to approach it step by step.\n\nLet me check the first few symbols: t3 t84 t36 t30 t3 t53.\n\nThe first symbol t3 is NT34. So in S -> NT6 NT34, the NT34 in the second position produces t3. Therefore, the NT6 in the first position must produce the rest of the string up to that point.\n\nWait, but that might not be right because S's expansion is NT6 and NT34. So the string should start with the expansion of NT6 followed by the expansion of NT34. So if the string starts with t3, that would require that NT34 produces t3, which it does, but then NT6 would have to produce t84 t36 t30 t3 t53.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of symbols. Let me see:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nThen NT34 -> t3.\n\nSo the first part is NT6 must produce the rest of the string starting from t84. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t3 (from NT34), then t84, t36, t30, t3, t53, etc.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Because if S is NT6 followed by NT34, and NT34 produces t3, then the string should be NT6's expansion followed by t3. So the entire string should be NT6 expansion + t3.\n\nBut the string starts with t3, not the expansion of NT6. That suggests that perhaps I made a mistake. Or maybe the string is actually starting with NT34, which produces t3, and then NT6 starts with t84.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused about the order. The string starts with t3, which is from NT34. So S -> NT6 NT34 would expand to NT6's expansion followed by NT34's expansion (which is t3). So the string would be NT6 expansion followed by t3. But the string starts with t3, which would mean that NT34 is the initial production, which doesn't align with S's first production.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps S is derived first, so S -> NT6 NT34. Then each of those NTs can produce other NTs. Let's see if any of the NTs can produce sequences leading to the string.\n\nLooking for NTs that can produce t84, which is a terminal. Let's search the productions for t84.\n\nLooking through the productions, some NT expansions produce terminals. For example, NT10 -> 't12', 't84', etc. Wait, actually, the list shows NT10 -> t12, t84, t12, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking through each NT's production:\n\n- NT20: 't45', 't12'?\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nNT31 -> ... some 't's.\nNT10: 't12', 't81'?\n\nWait, the line says NT10 -> 't84', 't12', 't84', etc. Let me check the exact lines:\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar lines, for NT10:\n\nNT10: t84, t12, etc. But in the lines:\n\nNT10 -> 't66', 't12', and other 't's. Hmm, this is getting messy. Maybe I should make a list of NTs that can produce each terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't3' comes from NT34.\n- 't84' comes from NT31 (looking at the productions: NT31 -> t43, t10. No. Wait, some NTs produce t84. Looking through NT21 lines: Wait, in the production for NT21: t37; no, that's 't37'.\n\nWait, looking through the NT productions for any that produce t84.\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT10: in the production lines, one of them is 't84' for NT10. Let me find it:\n\nLooking through the NT10 productions: \"NT10 -> NT4 NT31 | ...\". Wait, no, NT10's specific production lines are:\n\nLooking for 't84' in the NTs:\n\n- NT14: NT2 NT1 (no 't')\n- NT24: NT21?\n- Looking for specific productions. Wait, perhaps it's in NT31. NT31 -> 't43', 't0', etc. No. Wait, no.

{"custom_id":"request-610","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal or a terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in Chomsky Normal Form, the grammar is suitable for a shift-reduce parsing method, but maybe that's more advanced than I need right now. The key thing is that each production is concise and only involves two symbols. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see symbols like S, NT14, NT2, etc., which I assume are the non-terminals. Some of these, however, have productions that directly lead to terminals like 't77' or 't66'. The string to evaluate is a series of t's with numbers, so the terminals in the grammar are all t's followed by numbers. \n\nLet me write down the target string: t66 t83 t11 t84 t84 t18 t38 t3 t41 t12 t72 t50 t84 t0 t72 t18 t10 t25 t45 t49 t14 t77 t84 t39 t50 t83 t28 t36 t68 t61 t11 t65 t20 t25 t35.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step. But since the string is long, maybe I can look for patterns or possible paths.\n\nLet me check if there's a rule that can produce t66. Looking at the grammar, I see NT0 -> t66. So t66 must be the terminal produced by NT0.\n\nNow, in the string, the last symbol is t35, which is produced by NT35. Let's see if NT35 has any production. Looking through the grammar, I notice NT33 -> NT31 NT17, and NT33 is a non-terminal. Similarly, NT21 -> t81 in one production and t29 in another. Wait, but I don't see any NT35 in the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the symbols listed go from NT0 up to NT35, I think. Let me list out the NT symbols:\n\nNT14, NT20, NT12, NT19, NT22, NT31, NT11, NT10, NT31, NT6, NT1, NT6, NT22, NT33, NT27, NT15, NT27, NT28, NT2, NT31, NT12, NT6, NT21, NT27, NT18, NT10, NT1, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT33, NT22, NT24, NT10, NT31, NT10, NT33, NT21, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT25, NT25, NT24, NT10, NT31, NT10, NT33, NT21, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT25, NT25, NT24, NT10, NT31, NT10, NT33, NT21, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT25, NT25, NT24, NT10, NT31.\n\nWait, no, I might be getting this wrong. Let me check each symbol:\n\nWait, the symbols in the grammar are: S, NT14, NT2, NT15, NT20, NT12, NT19, NT22, NT31, NT11, NT10, NT31, NT6, NT1, NT27, NT4, NT21, NT27, NT28, NT2, NT31, NT12, NT6, NT21, NT27, NT18, NT10, NT1, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT33, NT22, NT24, NT10, NT31, NT10, NT33, NT21, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT25, NT25, NT24, NT10, NT31, NT10, NT33, NT21, NT11, NT18, NT22, NT34, NT25, NT25, NT24, NT10, NT31.\n\nWait, there are repetitions here, like NT10, NT31 appearing multiple times. So each NT symbol must have a unique production.\n\nLooking back at the string, I see a lot of t's and numbers. Let me try to find where the non-terminal symbols appear. For each element in the string, it's a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, so all the symbols to the right must consist of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo, the start symbol is S: S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo, S produces NT6 followed by NT34. Each of those is a non-terminal. So for S, we need to find rules for NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6: The grammar says NT6 has multiple productions, like NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT27 NT19, etc. Wait, looking at the first part: NT6 -> NT27 NT19, then later NT6 -> NT33 NT19, NT6 -> NT21 NT25, etc.\n\nSo NT6 can become several combinations. Let's pick one production for NT6 and then follow it down to see if we can reach the string.\n\nLet me see, for the string starting with t66, which is the symbol generated by NT0. But the start symbol S is not NT0. So perhaps the entire string must be derived from S through a series of steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if t66 appears somewhere in the possible derivations. Since t66 comes from NT0, and looking at the grammar, NT0 -> t66, so NT0 can be replaced directly by t66.\n\nNow, looking at the string, the first symbol is t66, which is produced by NT0. So in the derivation, somewhere there must be a production that introduces NT0, which then becomes t66.\n\nLooking at S: S -> NT6 NT34. So S leads to NT6 and NT34. Then, to get to NT0, which leads to t66, we need to see if either NT6 or NT34 can produce NT0.\n\nLooking at the grammar, do any of the non-terminals have a production that includes NT0?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT0 being produced by any non-terminal except itself, or perhaps through other rules. Wait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nNT1 -> 't29'\n\nNT27 -> 't72'\n\nNT4 -> 't29'\n\nNT21 -> 't37'\n\nNT0 -> 't66'\n\nAh, so NT0 is a terminal, right? Or wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that directly lead to terminals. For example, NT10 -> 't12', which is a terminal. So NT10 is a non-terminal that can produce a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 -> 't66' is a terminal. So in the grammar, NT0 is a terminal symbol, or is it a non-terminal that produces a terminal? This is confusing. Wait, in CFGs, non-terminals are the ones that can be replaced by other symbols. Terminals are leaves. But in this case, NT0 is written as a rule producing 't66', which would mean it's a non-terminal that directly produces the terminal 't66'.\n\nSo in the string, whenever I see 't66', that must come from NT0. Similarly, NT10 is a non-terminal that produces 't12'.\n\nSo, back to S: S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nTo generate the string starting with t66, I guess that in the derivation, one of NT6 or NT34 must produce a string that starts with 't66' via NT0.\n\nBut looking at NT6, earlier, we have NT6 -> NT27 NT19, among others. Let's pick one: NT6 -> NT27 NT19.\n\nThen, NT6 becomes NT27 followed by NT19. Now, let's see what NT27 and NT19 produce.\n\nLooking at NT27, it has rules like NT27 -> NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-612","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that context-free grammars (CFGs) are defined by a set of production rules, and they generate strings through a series of derivations. The grammar here is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it all checks out. Each production either has two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal. Good, so it's in CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t52 t52 t67 t47 t20 t20 t61 t40 t0 t14 t57 t30 t0 t83 t50 t35 t18 t52 t52 t66 t81 t81 t20 t66 t47 t49 t67 t38 t23 t80 t66 t0 t83 t40 t23`.\n\nI notice that this string consists solely of terminal symbols, so my task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the string should start with a derivation from NT6 and NT34. Let me check what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6, it has multiple productions. For example, NT6 can produce NT27 NT19 or other combinations. Wait, but looking at the provided grammar, there are multiple productions for NT6, such as NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, etc. But when I look more carefully, I see that NT6 also has a production NT6 \u2192 't20', which is a terminal. Hmm, but in CNF, you can't have a production where the left-hand side is a single terminal. Wait, wait, actually, in CNF, the terminals are handled by productions like A \u2192 a. So, in this grammar, some of the non-terminals produce terminals directly.\n\nWait, let me clarify. NT6 has a production that leads directly to 't20', so that's a terminal. But when we're trying to derive the string, each step can choose a production for each non-terminal, replacing it with another non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nSo the string starts with t52 t52... Let's see.\n\nThe string is a series of t's followed by numbers. Since these are terminals, each must correspond to some production in the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the beginning: The first symbol is t52. So I need to find a path in the grammar that leads to t52. Looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce t52 directly. For example:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT25 \u2192 't52' and NT52? Wait, maybe not listed. Wait, looking:\n- NT25 \u2192 't57' and 't49' (multiple productions for NT25)\n- NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't20' (t20 isn't in the string except once, but the string has t52 starting). Wait, but looking at the data, I notice that some non-terminals have t47, t20, etc., but not t52 directly. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a production where a non-terminal can derive t52.\n\nLooking back, I see under NT25: NT25 \u2192 't57' and 't49', so that's two terminals. Hmm, I don't see a production directly for t52 in the non-terminals. Wait, but in the provided grammar, I see NT25's productions are 't57' and 't49', so no, NT25 doesn't produce t52.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I should look for non-terminals that can produce t52. Let me check all the rules.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't immediately see any non-terminal that produces t52 unless it's produced via another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work from the string backwards, trying to see if each t can be matched to a production in the grammar.\n\nLet's take the string as a series of tokens: [t52, t52, t67, t47, t20, t20, t61, t40, t0, t14, t57, t30, t0, t83, t50, t35, t18, t52, t52, t66, t81, t81, t20, t66, t47, t49, t67, t38, t23, t80, t66, t0, t83, t40, t23].\n\nSo, the entire string is 36 tokens long.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe number of symbols in the string should follow the pattern 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., because each step in the derivation doubles the length when moving from a left-hand side (LHS) symbol to the right-hand side (RHS). However, the initial string is of length 36, which is 36. Let's see, log2(36) is about 5.17, so not a power of 2, which suggests that this string might not be derivable, but maybe I'm wrong because the number could vary depending on the structure.\n\nWait, no, because not all non-terminals produce both non-terminals and terminals, but wait, in CNF, productions are binary, so each step increases the length by a factor of 2. So the length of the string must be a power of 2. Let me check: 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. 36 is not a power of 2, so that would suggest that the string is invalid, but I might be mistaken because in this case, the initial step starts with two non-terminals, so the initial length is 2, then 4, 8, etc. So the final string must have a length of 2^k. Since 36 is not a power of 2, that could indicate that the string is uns derivable.\n\nWait, no, the initial string has two symbols, then each production could contribute to the length. Wait, no, the initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which is two non-terminals, so that's length 2. Each time you expand a non-terminal, it's replaced by two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), so the length can increase as 2, 4, 8, etc., but in this case, the string is 36 symbols, which isn't a power of 2, so it's impossible for it to have been generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, that would be a solid argument. Because the minimal length is 2, and any expansion step doubles the length, so the possible lengths are 2,4,8,16,32,64, etc. 36 is not in this list, so the string cannot be generated.\n\nBut wait, in the case of the initial S producing NT6 and NT34, each of which can be terminals or non-terminals. If any non-terminal in NT6 or NT34 expands into terminals, then the total length would decrease, but in CNF, each production either stays the same (if terminals) or doubles (if non-terminals). Wait, no, each production is from a single non-terminal, which can be replaced by two symbols, either two non-terminals, or two terminals, or a mix. Wait, but in the problem statement, the grammar is in CNF, which would mean that all productions are A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each production of a non-terminal A can only produce two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so each can produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So when replacing a non-terminal, the output is either two non-terminals (length increases by factor 2) or one terminal (no change in length). Hmm, no. Wait, the string is a series of symbols. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step can replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals (increasing the count by 1) or with a terminal (no change).

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the string: `t81 t30 t50 t73 t72 t66 t23 t14 t20 t81 t65 t71 t53 t0 t22 t35 t41 t81 t23 t14 t11 t45 t72 t35 t55 t40 t57 t20 t67 t18 t11 t49 t39 t38 t39 t71`.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal, either 't' followed by a digit, or some other letters and numbers. Wait, actually, in the grammar provided, all terminals are 't' followed by a number. So tokens like 't72', 't23', etc. So the string is a sequence of these 't' followed by digits.\n\nThe task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step increases the length of the string by one, and the entire string must be generated by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals remain.\n\nSince the string is quite long, let's see how to approach this. Maybe we can work backwards, starting from the string and trying to find the productions that could have generated each part. Alternatively, perhaps identifying the leftmost derivations or using the parsing table method.\n\nAnother approach is to think about the structure of the grammar. Let's list the productions again to see which terminals correspond to which non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- The start symbol S produces NT6 NT34. So S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nEach of these NTs produces other NTs or terminals. Let's look at NT6:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19, among other productions. But in the string, we see t66, t72, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the terminal mappings:\n\nFrom the grammar, many rules end in terminals:\n\nNT1 -> t61\nNT6 -> t20\nNT14 -> t72\nNT19 -> t47\nNT15 -> t65\nNT22 -> t77 (twice)\nNT27 -> t72 (twice)\nNT4 -> t29\nNT2 -> t28\nNT31 -> t35, t43, etc.\nNT21 -> t37\nNT0 -> t66\nNT7 -> t66 or t73\nNT25 -> t49, t57\nNT24 -> t14\nNT10 -> t84, t40, t12, t84 again?\nNT33 -> t30\nNT34 -> t3\nNT20 -> t45\nNT17 -> t40 or t54, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, let's list the tokens:\n\nt81, t30, t50, t73, t72, t66, t23, t14, t20, t81, t65, t71, t53, t0, t22, t35, t41, t81, t23, t14, t11, t45, t72, t35, t55, t40, t57, t20, t67, t18, t11, t49, t39, t38, t39, t71.\n\nSo, t81 is a problem. Let's check the grammar rules where t81 appears. Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t81. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any production rule that has t81. All the productions either produce other non-terminals or terminals that are 't' followed by digits not 81.\n\nHmm. So, the token t81 isn't appearing on the right-hand side of any production rule in the grammar. That suggests that either the string has a symbol that's not in the grammar, making it impossible, or maybe a typo. Wait, let's double-check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules provided:\n\nThe provided grammar has productions like NT7 -> t66, NT17 -> t66, NT18 -> t22, and so on. I don't see any production that results in 't81'. So, the grammar doesn't produce 't81' as a terminal. That would mean that any string containing 't81' is not possible, hence the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed a rule that outputs t81. Let's go through the rules again. Looking at the NT rules, it seems none of them result in t81. For example:\n\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17: Doesn't produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT that expands to 't81'. So the token 't81' is not in the terminal symbols of the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated because it contains a symbol that the grammar doesn't produce.\n\nSo the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-621","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means it consists of productions where each rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have a single terminal. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which is rewritten as NT6 NT34. So S produces two non-terminals: NT6 and NT34. Each of these non-terminals will have their own productions. My task is to see if the string provided can be derived from S through a series of these productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t55 t61 t77 t28 t72 t49 t80 t66 t50 t25 t73 t65 t22 t12 t83 t40 t68 t14 t39 t65 t3 t29 t41 t11 t18 t11 t29 t22 t23 t43 t81 t45 t36 t18 t47`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many non-terminals eventually resolve to terminal symbols. So I can probably work backwards, from the string to the start symbol S, by matching the string tokens to the terminals in the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me start by listing all the non-terminals and their productions to see which ones produce the given tokens.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that NT7 is sometimes t66 or sometimes t72. Similarly, NT0 can be t66 or t73. NT1 can be t61 or t29. NT2 can be t28 or t37, and so on.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to match the left-hand side of the grammar and see if I can produce the entire string.\n\nThe first step in the string is t36. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT24 produces t14, NT25 produces t49, and NT24 also appears as a terminal in some rules. Wait, let me check NT24.\n\nLooking at NT24: It can produce NT24 -> NT21 NT21 and also NT24 -> t14. So if I have t14 in the string, that's possible. But the string starts with t36, so I need a non-terminal that can produce t36.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT34 can produce t3. Hmm, not helpful. What about NT21? It can produce t71 or t29 or 't28' or 't21'? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the NT21 productions are:\n\nNT21 -> NT4 NT0\n\nBut also, according to the rules, NT25 -> t49, so if I have a production that could lead to t49, I could get t49.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should approach this by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar, starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with t36. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't36'? Let's search all the rules:\n\nChecking NT21: It has NT21 -> t28 or t29 or NT4 NT0, etc. NT4 -> t29. Hmm, but t36 is a terminal. I need a non-terminal that can yield t36.\n\nLooking again, I see that NT11 has a production where it can become 't18', 't43', 't67', 't39', or 't68', but that's for NT11. Not helpful for t36.\n\nWait, NT22 has some t73 and t31? Let me check:\n\nNT22 can produce 't10', 't22', 't23', 't43', 't11', etc. Hmm, no t36.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I might have missed NT21. Let me check NT21's productions again. Oh! NT21 has a production NT21 -> 't83' and 't29'. So t29 is possible. But how to get t36?\n\nWait, NT31 can produce 't43' or 't40' or 't35', etc., but also, NT31 appears in NT10's productions: NT10 -> 't84', 't22', 't31', 't21', 't40', 't73'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should see if there's a way to split the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is quite long, so I might need to figure out the structure. The first part is t36 t55 t61. Let's see where these tokens come from.\n\nt55 could be from NT33 -> 't55'. And t36 is from NT21, and t61 can be from NT10 or NT1.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nStarting from S: NT6 NT34.\n\nNT6 has several options. Looking at NT6: It can produce 't20', 't27', 't19', etc. For example, NT6 -> 't20' (if that was an option), but also NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> NT31 NT19.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 (twice) and NT6 -> NT31 NT19 once.\n\nSo from NT6, we can have two NT27s or one NT31.\n\nIn the string, after t36, we have t55, t61, which are all later tokens, so perhaps this is a bottom-up approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to use the CYK algorithm, which is appropriate for CNF grammars. But given that the string is quite long, maybe I can spot any immediate conflicts or impossibilities.\n\nWait, another thought: Each production in CNF uses two non-terminals, except when a non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So every step of the derivation alternates between getting a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nBut the string consists entirely of terminals: all tokens are 't's followed by numbers, so this suggests that the derivation must end directly with terminals. So each step would produce terminals when needed.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, the start symbol's productions produce non-terminals, which then may produce non-terminals or terminals. So a complete derivation would have a series of steps building up the string by replacing non-terminals.\n\nBut given that the string is all terminals, the derivation must consist of replacing each non-terminal with a terminal, step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we're dealing with a single left derivation or right derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to look for possible parse steps.\n\nThe first symbol in the string is t36. So looking for a non-terminal that can derive t36. From the grammar, checking each non-terminal to see if it can produce t36:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT21 can produce t28 and t29, but not t36.\n\nWait, NT21 can also produce NT4 NT0. If NT4 can produce t29 and NT0 can produce t66 or t73, but how does that help get t36?\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT22: It can produce 't73', 't12', 't18', etc., but not t36.\n\nLooking at NT24: It can produce 't14' but also NT21 NT21. But still, t36 isn't in that.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT33: It has 't55', but that's not t36.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminal NT31 can produce 't43', which isn't t36.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see where the 't36's come from. Looking at the grammar, let's check each production. \n\nLooking through all the productions, I see that NT21 can produce t28 (from some rules) and t29 from others. Also, looking at NT31, it's 't43' or 't40' or 't35', etc.\n\nHmm, so maybe it's possible for a non-terminal to produce nt21, which could then produce t28 or t29, but none of them give t36.\n\nWait, am I sure that the grammar includes a non-terminal that can directly produce t36?\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I notice that NT21 can produce t28 and t29, but I don't see any rules that produce t36 directly.

This way, I can see if the string can be derived according to the given productions.\n\nLet me consider the string and see if I can break it down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t30 t84 t20 t29 t11 t55 t41 t14 t30 t28 t52 t67 t80 t77 t39 t49 t10 t3 t29 t35 t43 t28 t47 t72 t83 t39 t30 t84 t61 t43 t73 t0 t37 t72 t41 t80 t65.\n\nLet me write it as a list: [t30, t84, t20, t29, t11, t55, t41, t14, t30, t28, t52, t67, t80, t77, t39, t49, t10, t3, t29, t35, t43, t28, t47, t72, t83, t39, t30, t84, t61, t43, t73, t0, t37, t72, t41, t80, t65].\n\nI'll start from the first symbol, t30. Now, I need to find a production that starts with t30. Looking at the grammar, I see NT11 -> t83, NT12 -> t68, NT14 -> t66, NT15 -> t54, NT17 -> t66, NT18 -> t22, NT22 -> t77, etc. Hmm, looking for a rule that directly produces t30.\n\nWait, none of the rules directly produce t30. Let me check all possible nt's and their productions to see which produce t30.\n\nLooking through the NT rules:\n\nLooking for any NT rule that is directly assigned to t30. Scanning through the definitions:\n\nNT6 is assigned to 't20', 't29', etc. Wait, let's look:\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar, under NT6, I see 't20', 't29', etc. Wait, no, that's in the middle. Let me find the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT productions that might produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't20', 't29', 't33', 't19', 't4', 't19' (duplicate?), etc. Wait, perhaps it's better to look for each nt that directly produces terminals.\n\nLooking through all the productions, any NT with a rule equal to a single terminal?\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT10 -> 't77', 't84', etc. Wait, NT10 has multiple rules, but I don't see any that produce t30.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan through each NT rule:\n\nNT10:\n- NT10 -> 't77'\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't11'\n- NT10 -> 't10'\n\nSo, NT10 directly produces t77, t12, t14, t11, t10.\n\nWait, no, that's for NT10. So none of them produce t30.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT5, but I don't see it in the list.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I need to see if any of the nt's have a production that results in t30. Looking through all the NT rules, perhaps NT35, NT43... no, perhaps none.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which nt rule can derive to t30. Looking through, maybe it's NT30. Wait, but looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't66'\n\nNT31 -> 't35'\n\nNT33 -> 't31', etc.\n\nWait, looking for NT30, perhaps:\n\nWait, checking through all the nt rules, I don't see an NT30 rule. So t30 must be produced by an NT that has a rule that eventually leads to t30.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string starting from the end or from the beginning, looking for the possible nt rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps constructing the derivation tree step by step.\n\nLet me try starting with the entire string and see if it can reduce to S.\n\nThe string is S, which is NT6 NT34. So S must expand into NT6 and NT34, each of which are non-terminals.\n\nSo, the first two non-terminals are NT6 and NT34. Wait, no, S expands into two non-terminals, so the entire string starts with the symbols generated by NT6 and then by NT34.\n\nWait, actually, in a leftmost derivation, S would first produce NT6 followed by NT34, so the string should start with NT6's expansion and then NT34's. So, the first part of the string should be generated by NT6, and the second part by NT34.\n\nSo, I need to check if the provided string starts with a correct expansion of NT6 and the remainder is correct for NT34.\n\nSo, the entire string is:\n\nt30 t84 t20 t29 t11 t55 t41 t14 t30 t28 t52 t67 t80 t77 t39 t49 t10 t3 t29 t35 t43 t28 t47 t72 t83 t39 t30 t84 t61 t43 t73 t0 t37 t72 t41 t80 t65.\n\nLet me split it into two parts: the first part generated by NT6 and the second by NT34.\n\nWait, but NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals, so their expansions will produce sequences of terminals. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nThus, I can try to see if the string can be divided into two parts, where the first part is generated by NT6 and the second by NT34.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to look for the possible expansions of NT6 and NT34 that would generate these sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start from the start and work my way through.\n\nBut perhaps this will take too long. Maybe I should look for the production rules that directly produce t30, but from the given grammar, I don't see any nt producing t30 directly. So t30 must be produced via a chain of productions down to terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal can generate t30.\n\nLooking through NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> 't20', 't29', 't33', 't19', etc.\n\nWait, for example, NT6 -> 't20' (direct). But we need to get t30 somehow. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me list all the nt rules that produce terminals:\n\n- NT10 -> 't77', 't12', 't14', 't11', 't10'\n\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n\n- NT18 -> 't22"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-629","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol and has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side, except for the start symbol which might produce terminals directly. Wait, but looking at the grammar, it seems that all non-terminals produce two non-terminals, except for the start symbol S which goes to NT6 and NT34. Hmm, no, wait: in CNF, every production should be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. But some of these rules seem to have terminals on the right side, like NT10 \u2192 't77'. That might not fit the strict CNF definition, but maybe the problem allows for some variation. Alternatively, perhaps 't' is a terminal, and the grammar mixes terminals with non-terminals, meaning it's actually an Extended Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nAnyway, the task is to see if the given string can be derived from the grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals: t23 t28 t77 t55 t47 t29 t71 t38 t43 t37 t72 t18 t67 t11 t40 t25 t61 t30 t83 t36 t45 t40 t35 t53 t57 t72 t41 t3 t41 t55 t55 t23 t65 t72 t57 t83 t57.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to break down non-terminals into combinations of other non-terminals and eventually into terminals. The first step is to see how to derive this string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with the expansion of NT6 and then NT34, concatenated together.\n\nI'll approach this by parsing the string from left to right, using the grammar rules to see if I can match each part.\n\nLet's start by breaking down the string into tokens, as they are all separated by spaces. The tokens are:\n\n1. t23\n2. t28\n3. t77\n4. t55\n5. t47\n6. t29\n7. t71\n8. t38\n9. t43\n10. t37\n11. t72\n12. t18\n13. t67\n14. t11\n15. t40\n16. t25\n17. t61\n18. t30\n19. t83\n20. t36\n21. t45\n22. t40\n23. t35\n24. t53\n25. t57\n26. t72\n27. t41\n28. t3\n29. t41\n30. t55\n31. t55\n32. t23\n33. t65\n34. t72\n35. t57\n36. t83\n37. t57\n\nThis is quite a long string. My plan is to see if I can reconstruct it using the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with NT6 expanded followed by NT34 expanded.\n\nLooking at the beginning tokens: t23, t28, t77... Hmm, but the first token is t23. Let's see what possible rules could start with t23.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT10, 11, 18, ..., I see that some produce 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT10 \u2192 't77', NT15 \u2192 't65', etc. So perhaps the first part of the string comes from a non-terminal that eventually produces a 't' token.\n\nLooking at the first token: t23. Checking the grammar, I don't immediately see any rule that directly produces 't23'. Wait, perhaps through a chain of productions. For example, if a non-terminal eventually produces 't23' through a series of steps.\n\nLooking across the rules, I don't see any terminal with 't23' except once in NT19 \u2192 't47' and some others, like NT22 \u2192 't77' etc. Wait, perhaps looking for a chain that can lead to 't23'.\n\nWait, looking for rules that end in 't23'. Let's see: There's a rule NT22 \u2192 't77', but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe through other rules.\n\nWait, the first part of the string is t23, t28, t77, t55, t47, t29, etc. It's four 't's at the start and then another t29. Maybe S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so NT6 and NT34 are both non-terminals, and each will expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28, etc. Hmm, perhaps looking for a way to get 't23' from NT6 or NT34.\n\nWait, in the grammar, are there any rules that produce 't23'? Let's check: looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that starts with NTX \u2192 't23'. So perhaps 't23' comes from a recursive expansion. Let's trace through possible expansions.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t23 t28. Since the string starts with NT6 \u2192 something, perhaps NT6 expands to produce t23 and t28.\n\nWait, let's look for a rule where the first symbol is t23. Scanning the rules, I don't see any direct production from a non-terminal to 't23'. So maybe t23 is the result of expanding a non-terminal step by step.\n\nLooking deeper, perhaps t23 can be derived from NT19: NT19 \u2192 't47', which is not helpful. Wait, maybe from NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'. Hmm, perhaps I'm going in the wrong direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains 't23' as part of a larger expansion. Maybe after expanding a non-terminal several times, the string of tokens emerges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string isn't in the language because 't23' can't be derived from any non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps looking into the rules, do any non-terminals derive into 't23'?\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals in the grammar and their production rules, I don't see any production that results in 't23'. For example, ND rules for NT10, 11, etc., produce various 't's, but none seem to be 't23'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the rules and see if 't23' appears anywhere.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT11 \u2192 't11'\n\nNT12 \u2192 't68'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT18 \u2192 't66'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77' (multiple times)\n\nNT27 \u2192 't72' etc.\n\nNT28 \u2192 't45'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29' etc.\n\nNT25 \u2192 't57'\n\nNT33 \u2192 't30'\n\nNT21 \u2192 't81'\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that produces 't23'. Therefore, it's impossible to derive 't23' from the given grammar. Thus, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first token 't23' doesn't appear in any production.\n\nWait, could it be that I made a mistake in not seeing the rule? Let me check again. Looking through all the rules, the non-terminals NT6, NT10, etc., all expand into other non-terminals, but none of them seem to produce 't23'. So perhaps the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string starts with 't23', which cannot be derived from any non-terminal in the given grammar. \nNo\n\nAnswer: No"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, all right, let me carefully scan each production.\n\nHere's the full list of production rules for the grammar (simplified):\n\nAll the NT rules start with NT, but for clarity, let's look for NT24. Is there a production where NT24 is the left side?\n\nI see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNo, that's NT22.\n\nLooking for NT24, it's there in another part.\n\nWait, the given grammar is long, perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, maybe I can list them in more organized way.\n\nLooking through each production in the grammar, it's a list of rules, each starting with a capital letter.

{"custom_id":"request-642","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG). The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is useful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to reason about the structure of the generated strings. CNF has production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of exactly two non-terminal symbols or a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n`t81 t84 t73 t71 t40 t30 t10 t65 t81 t50 t54 t29 t39 t84 t12 t55 t0 t55 t37 t25 t30 t23 t47 t23 t61 t11 t12 t37 t40 t67 t72 t18 t25 t30 t67 t54 t73 t55`\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the productions and terminals in the grammar. The terminals are the 't' tokens followed by numbers, like 't73'. Each production's RHS consists of either two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S -> NT6 NT34. So the derived string must start with the concatenation of the strings derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6 and NT34, let's see their productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25 or NT17 NT7 or NT27 NT19 or NT6 NT27 NT19 or NT31 NT17 or NT22 NT19 or NT4 NT3 (wait, no, the actual productions are more varied).\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each production in the CFG must decompose the string into parts that match the terminals derived from each production.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has either one or two non-terminals on the RHS. Therefore, when generating a string, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the derivation tree must decompose the string into a sequence of these two-symbol steps.\n\nLet's consider the string's structure. It starts with 't81', which is a terminal. But in CNF, each production step can only produce two symbols. So 't81' must be the result of a production that directly produces it, or it must be part of a larger production that expands further.\n\nLooking at the grammar's productions, the only place 't81' appears is in NT21 -> t37 and in NT7 -> t66 and t73. Wait, but in the grammar, NT7 has two productions: NT7 -> t66 and NT7 -> t73. Similarly, NT21 has NT21 -> t37 and NT21 also has another production.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT21 are:\nNT21 -> t37 and NT21 -> t81 as per the grammar? Or is that a typo? Wait, in the user's input, the grammar has:\n\nUnder NT21, the productions are:\nNT21 -> t37 and NT21 -> t81.\n\nWait, looking at the user's grammar lines, I see:\n\nNT21 -> t37\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT21 -> t81\n\nYes, there are two productions for NT21: one produces t37 and another produces t81.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string:\n\nLooking through the string, we have:\n\nt81, t84, t73, t71, t40, t30, t10, t65, t81, t50, t54, t29, t39, t84, t12, t55, t0, t55, t37, t25, t30, t23, t47, t23, t61, t11, t12, t37, t40, t67, t72, t18, t25, t30, t67, t54, t73, t55.\n\nI notice that several of these are terminals. So each must appear as a terminal in some production.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is t81, which is produced by NT21.\n\nLooking at NT21, it can produce either t37 or t81. So the first symbol is t81, which corresponds to NT21 -> t81, so that's one possibility. Alternatively, it could be another production leading to t81, but in this case, only NT21 -> t81 exists.\n\nWait, let me check again: in the grammar, under NT21, there is:\n\nNT21 -> t37\n\nand\n\nNT21 -> t81\n\nSo NT21 can produce t81, which is the first symbol in the string.\n\nNext, the second symbol is t84. So after the first symbol t81, we have t84. But in CNF, the production steps break down into pairs. So perhaps the next part after t81 is part of another production.\n\nWait, maybe the parsing tree is such that the entire string is a result of a series of productions where each non-terminal is expanded into two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial productions of S (S -> NT6 NT34) will generate a string that's a sequence of symbols, and each non-terminal step will expand into pairs.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build the derivation tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which expands to NT6 NT34. So the first two symbols in the string must be the start of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, the first symbol in the input string is t81, which is from NT6. Because NT6 is the first part of S's expansion, right?\n\nWait, S -> NT6 NT34, so the string starts with the expansion of NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t81, which is from NT6. So the expansion of NT6 must start with t81, which would mean that NT6 -> ... starts with t81. But looking at the grammar, NT6 has several productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT6 NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT31 NT17\nNT6 -> NT22 NT19\nNT6 -> NT4 NT3 (I think, because I saw that the last line is NT6 -> NT4 NT3, but wait, actually the user's grammar has multiple entries for NT6, but looking at the list, the actual productions are:\n\nLooking through the user's grammar lines:\n\nNT6 is defined as:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT31 NT17\n- NT6 -> NT22 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT4 NT3\n\nWait, so NT6 has multiple productions, including some that produce two non-terminals. So the first symbol of the string is t81, which comes from NT21 (since NT21 can produce t81).\n\nBut wait, the initial step is S -> NT6 NT34. So the first part of the string must be generated by NT6 and then by NT34.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a parsing process. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parser typically uses a stack-based approach, reading the string from left to right, decomposing according to CNF rules.\n\nSo let's simulate this.\n\nThe string is: t81 t84 t73 t71 t40 t30 t10 t65 t81 t50 t54 t29 t39 t84 t12 t55 t0 t55 t37 t25 t30 t23 t47 t23 t61 t11 t12 t37 t40 t67 t72 t18 t25 t30 t67 t54 t73 t55\n\nLet me list them for easier processing:\n\nt81, t84, t73, t71, t40, t30, t10, t65, t81, t50, t54, t29, t39, t84, t12,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that structure makes it easier to analyze, especially with methods like CYK parsing.\n\nFirst, let me look at the string. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, each being a string like 't81', 't73', up to the end. My task is to determine if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe grammar starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT6 and NT34. So the first step is to check if S can derive the string, which means breaking it down into the rules of the grammar.\n\nLooking at the top-level productions, S -> NT6 NT34. So the entire string must be a combination of what NT6 and NT34 can produce. Let me see what each of these non-terminals can generate.\n\nStarting with NT6: Looking at the production rules, NT6 can expand into several combinations. From the grammar, NT6 can be NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25 or NT6 NT25. Hmm, that seems a bit complex. Let me see if any of these produce tokens we have in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't81'. Let me check NT6's productions:\n\nLooking for 't81' in the right-hand sides of NT6's productions. From the rules, NT6 can produce 't27' and 't19' via NT27 -> 't72' and NT19 -> 't47', which are different from 't81'. Alternatively, NT6 -> NT27 NT19, which would give 't72' 't47'. But the string starts with 't81', so that might not be the right path.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's break down the string into segments and see if each segment can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nThe string is: t81 t73 t23 t52 t57 t36 t55 t80 t81 t12 t36 t43 t30 t12 t80 t72 t35 t45 t77 t47 t10 t40 t3 t38 t30 t30 t49 t72 t30 t35 t14 t35 t40 t18 t23 t81 t71 t65 t53.\n\nHmm, that's a lot. Let me try to group it into chunks that might correspond to non-terminals. Maybe I can start from the beginning.\n\nThe first symbol is 't81'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't81'? Let me check the rules. Scanning through, I see NT21 and NT10 produce some tokens.\n\nLooking for 't81' in the right-hand sides of any production. Let me see:\n\nNT21 -> 't37' and 't12' (from rules), but that's not 't81'.\n\nWait, another way: Maybe I should list all symbols and see if they correspond to terminals produced by the non-terminals.\n\nWait, another approach is to consider each terminal symbol as a terminal production. That is, each tXX corresponds to exactly one rule, so each token in the string must be matched to a terminal rule in the grammar.\n\nSo, for each token in the string, I need to see if it's a terminal, and then check if that terminal is produced by any non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production eventually terminates in terminals or non-terminals. The right-hand sides of non-terminals are combinations of other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, let me look at the grammar again. For example, S -> NT6 NT34, but NT6 and NT34 also have productions. Each of those may ultimately lead to terminals, like 't20', 't72', etc.\n\nPerhaps it's better to map each terminal in the string to its corresponding production rule.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFrom the grammar, we can see that each non-terminal leads to certain terminals:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nFor example, NT10 -> 't12', 't14', etc. Wait, no.

For example:\n\nEach non-terminal that has a production where the right-hand side is a terminal directly (i.e., a production like 't12' or 't55', etc.) is a rule that can produce that terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here's a list of all rules that produce terminals (each production where the right-hand side is entirely terminals, ignoring non-terminals that might be on the RHS):\n\n- NT1 -> 't14'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't29'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT27 -> 't72'\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n- NT6 -> 't80'\n- NT2 -> 't37'\n- NT21 -> 't37'\n- NT21 -> 't29'\n- NT4 -> 't36'\n- NT25 -> 't49'\n- NT25 -> 't57'\n- NT24 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT10 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't84'\n- NT19 -> 't47'\n- NT22 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT22 -> 't38'\n- NT31 -> 't43'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT11 -> 't83'\n- NT12 -> 't68'\n- NT12 -> 't54'\n- NT19 -> 't23'\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT21 -> 't71'\n- NT11 -> 't67'\n- NT15 -> 't18'\n- NT34 -> 't41'\n- NT22 -> 't25'\n- NT20 -> 't45'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n- NT6 -> 't52'\n\nWait, that's a long list.

{"custom_id":"request-658","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string I need to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow that structure. The start symbol is S. \n\nThe string to check is: `t68 t50 t71 t67 t45 t66 t53 t77 t61 t30 t18 t14 t73 t55 t29 t61 t40 t68 t23 t43 t12 t10 t22 t80 t50 t45 t43 t35 t65 t12 t57 t40 t53 t57 t29 t52 t14 t67 t57`. \n\nI think I should try to parse this string using the grammar. Parsing can get tricky, but maybe I can find a way to split it into the non-terminals as per the productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t68. I need to find where 't68' appears in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34, and NT12 is also being defined as generating 't68' (from the rule NT12 -> 't68'). But wait, looking back, I see NT12's productions:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34\nNT12 -> 't68'\n\nSo yes, NT12 can produce 't68'. So the first part of the string 't68' comes from NT12. \n\nNow, the remaining string after t68 is t50 t71 t67 t45 t66 t53 t77 t61 t30 t18 t14 t73 t55 t29 t61 t40 ... etc.\n\nWait, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. So it's a linear sequence, not the interleaving of non-terminals and terminals. Hmm, maybe it's a leftmost derivation. So starting with S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the first step would split into NT6 and NT34. \n\nBut in the string, the first terminal is t68, which comes from NT12. So perhaps S must first produce NT6 and NT34. So NT6 would produce the first part, and NT34 the rest? Or maybe the splitting isn't that straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the derivation alternates between NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the structure. The start symbol S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So in the derivation, we'll have S \u21d2 NT6 NT34 \u21d2 (something) (something else) ... until we get to the terminals. But since it's a CNF grammar, each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nSo the string is a flat sequence of terminals. To get a flat sequence, the derivation must fully expand all non-terminals. So the entire string must be formed by expanding S through the grammar, step by step, without any nested structures.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, each production for a non-terminal leads either to two non-terminals or a terminal. So let's try to map the string step by step.\n\nLet's list the string's terminals: t68, t50, t71, t67, t45, t66, t53, t77, t61, t30, t18, t14, t73, t55, t29, t61, t40, t68, t23, t43, t12, t10, t22, t80, t50, t45, t43, t35, t65, t12, t57, t40, t53, t57, t29, t52, t14, t67, t57.\n\nThat's 37 terminals. Since each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the number of non-terminals in the derivation tree would be 2^(n) -1, where n is the number of production steps. But since the string is a flat sequence, the number of terminals is equal to the number of leaves in the tree. The number of leaves would be 2^(k), where k is the number of production steps. Wait, that might not be the case because some productions produce terminals directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal can be traced back through the grammar to a path starting from S.\n\nLooking at the first term, t68, which as I saw comes from NT12. So t68 \u2192 NT12 \u2192 t68 (from NT12's production), meaning that NT12 can produce t68, so the first symbol comes from NT12.\n\nNow, since S \u2192 NT6 NT34, maybe the string starts with NT6's expansion. But the first symbol is t68, which comes from NT12. So perhaps NT6 must also produce t68. But wait, NT6's productions are:\n\nLooking back at the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 can also produce terminals like 't20' (but I don't see that here), wait no, in the NT6 productions, I don't see any terminal directly, only non-terminals. So for NT6 to produce a terminal, it must go all the way through to a terminal. Let's see:\n\nFor example, looking for 't68', which is in NT12. But in the NT6 productions, I don't see any production that leads directly to 't68'. So perhaps this is a problem. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check NT6's productions again.\n\nWait, the NT6 productions in the grammar are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT17 -> NT72 (and others) wait, no, I think NT17 is a non-terminal that eventually leads to terminals like 't72' and 't66'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t68. We know that in the grammar, t68 is produced by NT12 \u2192 't68'. But S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so how does t68 come out of S?\n\nThat suggests that the first production from S must somehow produce t68 as one of its terminals. But S \u2192 NT6 NT34, both are non-terminals. So for t68 to be the first symbol, either NT6 or NT34 must produce t68. \n\nBut looking at the production rules, NT6's paths don't seem to have any direct terminal except perhaps indirectly through other productions. Let's look at NT6's productions again:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nNow, following each of these:\n\n1. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (from NT27-> NT7 NT7)\n2. NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\n3. NT21 \u2192 NT6 NT18\n4. NT4 \u2192 NT29 (but that's a terminal via NT4).\n\nWait, let's follow each branch:\n\nStarting with NT27:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\nSo the terminal from NT27 is 't66' or 't73'. \n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\nNT24 \u2192 NT14\nNT14 \u2192 NT72\nNT72 \u2192 't72' or others, but wait, looking at NT72, do I see any production that produces a terminal?\n\nLooking back, NT72's production:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT22 NT0?

{"custom_id":"request-662","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is: `t38 t68 t71 t41 t57 t41 t20 t22 t25 t39 t29 t55 t20 t22 t18 t83 t29 t12 t73 t12 t81 t81 t20 t55 t36 t84 t39 t50 t38 t55 t11 t36 t30 t66 t50 t0 t47 t84 t39 t36`.\n\nWow, that's a long string. The string consists of a bunch of 't' followed by numbers. Each 't' probably represents a terminal symbol, I think the numbers are just part of the terminal strings. Now, each production rule in the grammar has either one terminal or two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the derivation process follows a specific structure.\n\nI need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the string should start with the sequence of symbols that NT6 and NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at the NT6 productions: There's a list of NT6 \u2192 ... So, for example, NT6 can \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT21 NT25, NT33 NT19, etc. Each of these leads to more productions until they reach terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look for the sequence of terminals in the string and see if they can be generated in the order specified by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nThe string starts with t38, so I need to see if the start symbol S can directly produce a terminal, or if it goes through non-terminals.\n\nLooking back, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first part is NT6, then NT34. So the first symbols should be what NT6 generates, followed by what NT34 generates. \n\nSo, T6 is the first in the string. NT6's first production is NT27 NT19, so the first t38 might come from NT27 or NT19. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't38' and NT25 \u2192 't49' and NT4 \u2192 't36' etc. Wait, actually, looking at the rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't38' directly. Because in the list, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't38'\n\nYes, so NT22 can produce t38. So perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT22 ... ?\n\nWait, looking at the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 | NT33 NT19 | NT21 NT25 | NT22 NT19 | NT12 NT0 | NT6 -> other things, etc.\n\nWait, in the initial response, the user split the grammar into individual productions, so I'm referring to the list they provided.\n\nLooking at the NT6 rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 has several productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT19\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT12 NT0\n6. NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT27 (but wait, this is in the list: NT6 -> NT6 NT27? Wait, no, looking back, I think the grammar provided is in a list that repeats, so I need to make sure.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar given:\n\nLooking through, let me find NT6's rules.\n\nYes, here's NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 \nNT6 -> NT33 NT19 \nNT6 -> NT21 NT25 \nNT6 -> NT22 NT19 \nNT6 -> NT12 NT0 \nNT6 -> NT6 NT27 \nNT6 -> NT6 NT25 \nNT6 -> NT6 NT19 \nNT6 -> NT6 NT17 ? \n\nWait, in the provided grammar, it's split into multiple lines, so let me list all NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT22 NT19\nNT6 -> NT12 NT0\nNT6 -> NT6 NT27\nNT6 -> NT6 NT25\nNT6 -> NT6 NT19\nNT6 -> NT6 NT17\n\nSo NT6 can produce itself and various other combinations. But in a top-down approach, we don't want infinite recursion, so we have to see if the first portion can be built.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t38. So looking at NT6's rules, one of them is NT22 \u2192 t38. So if NT6 can produce NT22, then the first part t38 is correct.\n\nBut wait, NT6's first production is to NT27 NT19, so S \u2192 NT6 NT34 would start with NT6, which produces NT27 NT19 or similar. So for the string to start with t38, NT6 must produce a NT22, which would produce t38.\n\nBut let's see if that's possible. So starting from S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Then the first two symbols are derived from NT6 and NT34. So NT6 must derive to produce t38 first, and NT34 must produce t68.\n\nWait, let's break down the string into pairs according to S \u2192 NT6 NT34. The first part is the output of NT6, and the second part is the output of NT34.\n\nSo the first symbol is t38, which is the start of NT6's expansion. NT6 must somehow derive to t38 as the first symbol, followed by what NT34 produces.\n\nBut NT6's first step is either of the NT productions, but to have t38 as the first symbol, it must be that NT6 can derive to something starting with t38. Looking at NT6:\n\nNT6 can directly produce NT22, which produces t38. So if NT6 \u2192 NT22, then the first symbol is t38. So that's possible.\n\nThen, the second symbol in the string is t68. So what does NT34 produce?\n\nLooking at NT34: According to the grammar, NT34 \u2192 't3', so it can produce directly t3. But wait, in our string, the second symbol is t68, which doesn't match t3. That's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps we're missing something. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT30 is defined, but not directly producing t68. Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar has various NTs, including NT12 \u2192 ... But the second symbol is t68. Where does t68 come from?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT12 has a rule \u2192 NT14 NT0. Not t68.\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are t38 t68 t71...\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to reconstruct.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 nt34. Then the first part is NT6, which becomes t38, and the second part is nt34, which becomes t68.\n\nWait, but from the grammar, nt34 only directly produces t3. So how does nt34 produce t68? That's impossible. So the string can't be generated because the second part requires nt34 to produce t3, not t68.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me make sure.\n\nThe string is: t38 t68 t71...\n\nSo after t38 comes t68. So if first part is from NT6 producing t38, then the next part should come from NT34, which should produce t68.\n\nLooking at nt34's productions:\n\nNT34 can only produce 't3' directly because, checking the grammar, it's defined as:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo nt34 can only produce 't3', which doesn't match the second symbol in the string, which is t68.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated because after t38, nt34 cannot produce t68.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps I need to check if the string can be generated by considering all possible productions.

{"custom_id":"request-669","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is a bit complex with a bunch of non-terminals and productions, and the string I need to check is a series of tokens. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has two rules for productions: each production is either A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. In this grammar, all the productions are in CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is good because it's two non-terminals. NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1 is also fine. All the way down, some rules have a single terminal, like NT10 \u2192 't77'.\n\nSo the string given is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. The string is: t73 t41 t72 t14 t38 t83 t49 t18 t3 t18 t83 t29 t10 t38 t84 t14 t18 t35 t81 t83 t45 t80 t54 t23 t10 t80 t23 t36 t67 t80 t84 t66 t40 t67 t11 t28 t50 t83 t35 t77.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. The approach here is to work from the string backwards, trying to match the productions. Essentially, we'll try to parse the string using the reverse of the grammar, checking if it can be generated.\n\nStarting from the entire string, I'll look for the rightmost non-terminal and see if it can produce the relevant part of the string. Let's walk through this.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a series of terminals. Let's group them into possible non-terminals by matching the productions in reverse.\n\nLooking at the productions, some terminals only appear on the right-hand side of certain productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\nWait, wait. Let me look more carefully. Hmm, looking at the grammar, NT7 appears on the right-hand side of NT7 -> t66 and t73. So NT7 can produce either 't66' or 't73'.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 has several productions leading to various non-terminals, but some terminals like 't20', 't80', etc.\n\nBut maybe it's better to start from the end of the string and see which production can derive the last few tokens.\n\nThe last token is t77. Looking at the grammar, the productions that have t77 as a terminal are:\n\n- NT18 -> t77\n- NT10 -> t77\n- NT6 -> t77?\n\nWait, looking through the list, NT7 \u2192 t66 and t73. But t77 is not there. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking again, I think I made a mistake.

Hmm, in the productions, is there any NT that produces t77?

{"custom_id":"request-679","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal on the left side of an arrow expands into two non-terminals on the right. Some of these non-terminals might be terminals, so each production essentially replaces one symbol with two others. The start symbol is S, and from there, we derive strings until we reach all terminals.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's written out as a series of productions like S -> NT6 NT34, and then each NT has its own productions. Some of these NTs eventually expand into terminals like 't0', 't3', etc. So, each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by expanding one into two, until eventually, the whole string is made up of only terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t41 t73 t67 t22 t50 t14 t50 t68 t83 t41 t49 t23 t54 t30 t25 t30 t50 t71 t65 t28 t40 t20 t38 t39 t30 t80 t68 t36 t39 t12 t14 t41 t57 t83 t81 t12 t66 t36 t20 t54`.\n\nMy approach is to reverse the process. Instead of starting from the start symbol S and generating the string, which could be complicated, I'll try to parse the string from the end, checking if each pair of terminals can be derived from the grammar, working backward to the start.\n\nBut maybe a better way is to consider that in CNF, each production produces exactly two symbols, so the total number of symbols in the derived string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps, starting from the single start symbol. Let me count the tokens in the given string. The string has 37 tokens. Wait, 37 is an odd number, but since each step doubles the number of symbols or something similar, perhaps that's not possible. Wait, starting from 1 symbol (S), each expansion step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length becomes 1, then 2, then 4, etc. So the total number of terminals after each expansion is 2^k, where k is the number of expansions. But here, we have 37, which is not a power of two, since 2^5=32 and 2^6=64. So that immediately raises a red flag. Maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Wait, let me recount the string's tokens:\n\nLooking at the string: it's 37 tokens. Let's count them: 1 (t37), 2 (t41), 3 (t73), 4 (t67), 5 (t22), 6 (t50), 7 (t14), 8 (t50), 9 (t68), 10 (t83), 11 (t41), 12 (t49), 13 (t23), 14 (t54), 15 (t30), 16 (t25), 17 (t30), 18 (t50), 19 (t71), 20 (t65), 21 (t28), 22 (t40), 23 (t20), 24 (t38), 25 (t39), 26 (t30), 27 (t80), 28 (t68), 29 (t36), 30 (t39), 31 (t12), 32 (t14), 33 (t41), 34 (t57), 35 (t83), 36 (t81), 37 (t12), 38 (t66), 39 (t36), 40 (t20), 41 (t54). Wait, that's 41 tokens. So I must have miscounted earlier. Let's recount correctly.\n\nLooking again: the string is t37 t41 t73 t67 t22 t50 t14 t50 t68 t83 t41 t49 t23 t54 t30 t25 t30 t50 t71 t65 t28 t40 t20 t38 t39 t30 t80 t68 t36 t39 t12 t14 t41 t57 t83 t81 t12 t66 t36 t20 t54.\n\nCounting the number of spaces: let's split the string into parts:\n\n1. t37\n2. t41\n3. t73\n4. t67\n5. t22\n6. t50\n7. t14\n8. t50\n9. t68\n10. t83\n11. t41\n12. t49\n13. t23\n14. t54\n15. t30\n16. t25\n17. t30\n18. t50\n19. t71\n20. t65\n21. t28\n22. t40\n23. t20\n24. t38\n25. t39\n26. t30\n27. t80\n28. t68\n29. t36\n30. t39\n31. t12\n32. t14\n33. t41\n34. t57\n35. t83\n36. t81\n37. t12\n38. t66\n39. t36\n40. t20\n41. t54.\n\nSo, the string is 41 tokens long. 41 is an odd number, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production results in two symbols. So starting from one symbol (S), each step replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols increases as 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. 41 isn't a power of two, and it's not possible for the string to be generated if it's not a power of two. Wait, is that correct? Or is there a way to handle that? Let me think: if the start symbol S is a non-terminal, then initially, the string is just S (1 symbol). After one expansion, it's two symbols. After two expansions, it's four, and so on. So the total number of symbols at any point is always a power of two. So if our string has 41 symbols, it can't be generated by this grammar because 41 is not a power of two.

Similarly, NT6 can expand into 't72' or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't' tokens, so each 't' must be matched by a terminal production rule from a non-terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, we need to see if the entire string can be derived by expanding S through a series of productions to terminal symbols.\n\nSince the string is quite long (62 tokens), manually expanding would be time-consuming, so perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some patterns can be observed. For instance, looking for repeated terminals or sequences that might not fit any production rule.\n\nLooking at the string: `t72 t20 t35 t38 t36 t20 t20 t30 t0 t68 t39 t43 t28 t80 t68 t14 t30 t43 t0 t84 t22 t84 t12 t11 t52 t40 t52 t45 t3 t54 t77 t28 t39 t53 t65 t20 t20 t49 t3 t30 t71`.\n\nI notice that 't77' appears twice. Looking back at the productions, NT10 \u2192 't77' and perhaps there's a production for NT7 leading to 't73' but not 't77'. Wait, NT7 can expand into 't72' or 't73'? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\nSo NT7 can be 't73', which happens later in the string, but where is 't77' coming from? Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that leads to 't77'. However, NT10 can be 't77'. So 't77' must come from NT10.\n\nBut looking at the string, 't77' appears at positions: 15 (counting from 0? Or maybe not, let's see the exact string: positions after the first token.

It has a starting symbol S that produces NT6 NT34. Then each of these NTs has productions that eventually break down into a series of terminal symbols. Some NT symbols produce other NT symbols, and others produce terminal characters like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nSince the string only has 't' followed by numbers, I'll need to see if the grammar can derive this string. I'll start by breaking down the string into its components: each \"tX\" is a terminal symbol, so I need to find a production path that eventually leads to each of these.\n\nI'll try to map the string from the start symbol S. S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Then each of these can be further broken down.\n\nNT6 \u2192 various options, but looking at the end of the string, I see t50, t68, t45, etc. Checking the productions for NT6, I see NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 ... Wait, looking back, some rules might be more productive. For example, NT6 has several rules, but I need to find which can lead to the required t-values.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 again. Each of these depends on NT27, NT19, etc.\n\nLooking at NT27, it has two options: NT7 NT7 or NT7 NT7 again. Wait, checking the grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT7 NT7? Wait, in the provided grammar, NT27 has two rules: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 again? Or perhaps it's a typo. No, looking again, NT27 is defined as NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, it's written as NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 again. So that's redundant, perhaps.\n\nSo NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. NT7 has two productions: NT7 \u2192 t66 or NT7 \u2192 t73. So each NT27 can generate either t66 t66, t66 t73, or t73 t66, or t73 t73. So that's four possibilities.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice t68 appears. So how do we get t68? Let's look for a production that includes t68. Looking through the grammar, I see NT20 has a production NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT31. Wait, checking the productions: NT20 has NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT31 or NT15 is defined elsewhere. Wait, in the grammar, looking for 't68': in the productions, NT12 \u2192 NT14 NT0; NT14 \u2192 t72; so if NT14 is t72, then NT12 would produce t72 followed by NT0. Looking at the grammar, NT0 is only defined as NT0 \u2192 't66'. Wait, no, at the end of the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't66'.\n\nWait, so NT20: looking in the grammar, NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT31. And NT15 has NT15 \u2192 't65'. So NT20 \u2192 't65' NT31. Now NT31 has several productions: NT31 \u2192 't35', 't43', 't50', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar for NT31, it can produce 't35', 't43', 't50', 't31 t43' again, etc. So for example, NT31 can produce t35, t43, t50, t31 t43, t35 t36, etc. Also, NT31 \u2192 NT10 NT31 and NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0, among others.\n\nBut in the end, NT31's terminals are either several t's or 't66' since NT10 is 't12' or 't40' and so on.\n\nWait, but in the string, I see 't68' a couple of times. Let's see if any NT can produce 't68'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't68'. So maybe I need to see if any combination can produce 't68'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's generated via some combination of productions. For example, looking at NT28: NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11. NT20 is 't65' or other things? Wait, no, NT20 \u2192 't65' as per the grammar? Wait, let me check: in the grammar, the exact productions are:\n\nLooking for 't68': the only NT that directly produce a 't' are those with 't' followed by a number. So NT6 \u2192 't20', NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73', etc. So to get 't68', perhaps it's generated via a two-step production. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and each of those can produce certain t-values.\n\nWait, perhaps NT27 is 't73', and NT19 is 't47'. So NT27 NT19 \u2192 't73 t47'. But the string has 't68' and another 't68' later. So maybe 't68' comes from another path.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, is there an NT that can produce 't68'? Let's check all NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20' (among others)\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't12' or 't40'\n\n- NT11 \u2192 't11' or 't54'\n\n- NT12 \u2192 't68'?\n\nWait, looking at NT12: in the grammar, NT12 has several productions, including NT12 \u2192 NT14 NT34. Wait, but in the string, 't68' appears. Looking at the grammar, does any NT directly produce 't68'? I don't think so. The productions only define certain NTs to terminal t's.\n\nWait, perhaps 't68' is generated via a chain of NTs. For example, NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11. If NT20 produces 't65' and NT11 produces 't54', then that's 't65 t54', which wouldn't give 't68'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT12: in the grammar, NT12 \u2192 NT14 NT34. Now NT14 \u2192 't72', and NT34 \u2192 't3'. So NT12's terminals would be 't72 t3', which is 't72 t3' \u2192 '72 3' but the string has '68'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT22: in the grammar, NT22 has several productions, including NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15. Now NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT15 \u2192 't65' \u2192 '29 65', which isn't '68'.\n\nAlternatively, NT22 can produce 't72' and 't10 t14' and others. Let's check: NT22 \u2192 't72' \u2192 but '72' is too high and the string has '68'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the grammar again for any NT that can produce 't68':\n\nLooking at NT33: NT33 \u2192 't55', and other options: NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17. So NT31 could produce 't50' etc., and NT17 can produce 't66' or 't66' again.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT19: NT19 can produce 't67' or 't47'. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-689","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, CNF is where every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, right? So each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. That should help in parsing and determining derivation steps.\n\nThe grammar is given with a bunch of productions. Let me try to list them out to get a better picture. Starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S is the start symbol and it's generating NT6 and NT34. Both NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals, meaning they need to be expanded further.\n\nNext, I should see if any of these non-terminals produce terminals. Looking through the list, I spot several places where NTs directly produce terminals. For example, NT10 \u2192 't77', NT15 \u2192 't65', NT19 \u2192 't47', and so on. So each NT that has a production ending in a single 't' is a terminal.\n\nNow, the input string is: \n\nt50 t55 t83 t28 t53 t30 t65 t14 t57 t81 t52 t54 t68 t84 t14 t35 t45 t53 t80 t53 t57 t38 t10 t40 t61 t49 t37 t28 t53 t36 t71 t80 t49 t65 t38 t18 t55 t65 t55 t71 t30 t14.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from S by following the production rules. Since each production is in CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, wait no\u2014no, in CNF, each production must be either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Therefore, during derivation, each non-terminal can expand to either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the input string, we have a sequence of terminals. That means the derivation path must consist of expanding non-terminals all the way down to terminals, never stopping until we get exactly the string.\n\nSo each step in the derivation involves replacing a non-terminal with two other symbols, which may themselves be non-terminals or terminals. So every time we expand a non-terminal, it becomes either two non-terminals or a terminal. Therefore, the length of the string increases by one each time a non-terminal is expanded into two symbols.\n\nWait, but in the input string, the length is fixed. So perhaps we need to model the derivation steps to see if the input can be obtained starting from S.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S expands into NT6 and NT34. Both of these are non-terminals. So the next step would involve expanding each into their respective productions.\n\nLooking at NT6 and NT34. Let me see what their productions are.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, or also NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19. So NT6 can expand into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 NT3 NT17, and NT34 \u2192 NT55. Wait, looking back at the grammar, NT34's productions are:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT17, and NT34 \u2192 NT55. Wait, no, in the provided grammar, I think I might have misread. Let me check:\n\nYes, looking again, the grammar shows NT34 \u2192 NT3 NT17, and also NT34 is involved in other productions like S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nWait, I might need to list all the productions systematically. Let me go through each NT and note their possible expansions.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nNT6: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19.\n\nNT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, or NT27 \u2192 NT7 (wait, looking back). Wait, in the grammar, NT27's productions are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and also NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Wait, in the given grammar, does it have more than that? Let me check.\n\nLooking again, for NT27:\n\nNT27 has two productions: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 again? No, perhaps I misread. Wait, I see:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT27: \n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 again? Or perhaps that's a typo. Wait, looking back, under NT27:\n\nNT27 is followed by:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nThen, under other NTs, like NT7 appears here: NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't73'.\n\nSo, NT27 can only expand into two instances of NT7, which itself can produce either 't66' or 't73'. \n\nSo, back to NT6, when expanded, becomes two NT27s. So NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT27. Then each NT27 becomes two NT7s, which can be terminals.\n\nWait, so let's model this step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nNT6 expands to NT27 NT27. Now, NT34 expands to NT3 NT17. Then NT34 continues to produce NT55? Wait, in the grammar, NT34's productions are:\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT34:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT17\n\nand\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT55.\n\nWait, no, is there an NT55? Let me check.\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT55 is a terminal: NT55 \u2192 't55'.\n\nWait, wait, in the grammar list, under NT55, it's a production: NT55 \u2192 't55'.\n\nSo yes, so when NT34 is expanded, it can go to either NT3 NT17 or NT55.\n\nBut wait, looking again:\n\nThe grammar under NT34 is:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT3 NT17,\n\nand later, under NT55:\n\nNT55 appears under S, wait no, under other NTs.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar:\n\nUnder NT24, there's a production to NT14. Under NT19, NT19 \u2192 't47'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of all non-terminals and their possible expansions.\n\nLet me try to list each non-terminal and their possible right-hand sides (RHS). For each NT, RHS options:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n\n- NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\n\n- NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\n- NT24 \u2192 NT14 NT0\n\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 | NT33 NT19\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT29 NT29\n\n- Wait, let me go through each NT step by step.\n\n1.

Let's see, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal. But looking at the grammar, it seems all the productions are correctly in CNF. So that's good.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t23 t37 t45 t37 t12 t50 t49 t53 t52 t73 t23 t36 t20 t49 t68 t10 t65 t12 t29 t72 t36 t80 t38 t77 t39 t3 t57 t10 t71 t20 t52 t25 t41 t29 t54 t28 t53 t67 t65 t52 t22 t12`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation should follow the rules exactly. So I'll try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it production is S -> NT6 NT34. So the first two symbols must be NT6 and NT34. Let's check the string:\n\nt12... is the first token. Wait, but S's first production gives NT6 and NT34, so that means the first two tokens should be the results of NT6 and NT34.

Wait, what does NT6 produce?\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT17 -> t66\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, NT6 is:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT6 NT19 (Wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I don't see that.

Maybe I can make a table of all non-terminals and their productions, then try to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or recursive calls. But since this is a thought process, I can outline the steps.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\n1. The string starts with t12. So the first non-terminal must be NT12, since in CNF, the only way to get a terminal is through a production that terminates. So NT12's productions will end with a terminal. Let me look at NT12's productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\nNT12 -> NT1 NT34\nNT12 -> NT14 NT0\n\nWait, so NT12 can produce NT1 NT34, or NT14 NT0. But to get a terminal, perhaps the only way is if one of these productions leads to a terminal. Wait, but in this grammar, looking through each NT's productions, almost all of them produce non-terminals except for those that directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar:\n\nLooking at NT1: NT1 -> NT14 NT28, but ends with NT14 -> NT2 NT1... So it's terminal? No, let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way to get a terminal is through leaves, so each NT must produce two NTs, and their derivation leads down to a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, are any of the NTs directly producing a single terminal or more?\n\nLooking, for example:\n\nNT7: NT7 -> t72, or t73, etc. Wait, yes, in the grammar, some NTT produce terminals:\n\nNT7: NT7 -> t66, but wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT7's productions:\n\nLooking back, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 -> t66\nNT7 -> t73\n\nWait, is that correct?

The string starts with t12. Check if 12 is a terminal. Looking at the NT12's productions, I see NT12 can go to NT1 NT34. NT1 can derive further, so maybe that's not direct. Alternatively, perhaps NT12 isn't part of the derivation at the start.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first check what the first non-terminal can derive to t12.\n\nLooking, the NT12 can produce two NTTs, neither of which is a terminal, so perhaps t12 is produced by another rule.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, is there any NT production that can derive to t12?\n\nLooking through all NTTs, perhaps.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\nNT12 -> NT1 NT34 (so it goes further)\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19, etc.\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-693","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is long, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two non-terminals or terminals on the right. This structure should make parsing manageable, especially using algorithms like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing.\n\nLooking at the string, I see it's a sequence of terminals like 't41', 't61', etc. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nTo do this, I consider that each step of the derivation will involve replacing non-terminals with their right-hand sides. Since each production has two parts, I can model this as a tree where each node has exactly two children, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nThe string has 33 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree for a string of length n must have a height of log2(n), approximately. So, for n=33, log2(33) is around 5. Therefore, the minimum height is 5, meaning the derivation should involve steps that build up from the root to the leaves in 5 levels.\n\nI'll start by looking at the start symbol S. S -> NT6 NT34. So the root of the tree has two children: NT6 and NT34.\n\nEach of these non-terminals must be expanded. For example, NT6 can expand into two parts. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or others. Each step is a choice of production.\n\nI realize this could take a lot of branches, so perhaps it's better to work backwards from the string. Parsing the string to see if it can be segmented into parts that match the productions.\n\nLet's see the string:\n\nt41 t61 t25 t65 t0 t73 t54 t68 t18 t50 t18 t61 t61 t3 t80 t65 t80 t84 t55 t39 t29 t83 t57 t71 t37 t28 t55 t77 t72 t22 t52 t36 t81 t81 t40 t18 t43 t30 t12 t71 t23 t36 t68.\n\nPerhaps I can break it down into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t41. Looking at the productions, is there any rule that directly produces t41? Let me check. I see NT34 -> t3, NT33 -> t55, NT22 can produce t77, etc. There's a rule NT24 -> t14. Wait, looking further, NT34 has NT22 -> t77, but not directly t41.\n\nWait, looking again, the last production is NT34 -> t3. So, perhaps t41 is from a production like NT4 -> t29, but that's another NT.\n\nWait, NT15 -> t65. No, not sure.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and see which ones appear. The terminals in the grammar are various 't' followed by numbers. So I need to see if the string consists only of these terms and if each step can produce them.\n\nLooking at the productions, each non-terminal either produces another non-terminal or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation must either replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. So, in each step, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, for the string to be derived, each node in the tree must split into two parts, which may themselves split further until leaves (terminals) are reached.\n\nGiven the string's length, the derivation must happen over several levels, as I thought earlier.\n\nI think it might be complex to track the entire derivation, so perhaps I can try to find a way to split the string into parts that align with the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each production starts with a non-terminal that expands into two parts, and each part can be another non-terminal or a terminal. So each step in the derivation would split the string into two parts from a non-terminal, each part being the result of expanding those non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of recursive segmentation. For example, the root S splits into two parts: NT6 and NT34. So the string should be split into two parts, each of which must be derivable from NT6 and NT34, respectively.\n\nSo, for the entire string to be derivable, it must be possible to split it into two substrings, the first derivable from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nLooking at the entire string, the first symbol is t41. Let's try to see if the first part can be derived from NT6.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT6 NT25 or NT21 NT25 or NT25 NT25.\n\nWait, the possible productions for NT6 are:\n\nLooking back, the given rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT6 NT25\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 -> NT25 NT25\n\nSo, NT6 can expand into two parts, each of which can themselves expand further.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is t41 t61 t25 t65 t0 t73 t54 t68 t18 t50 t18 t61 t61 t3 t80 t65 t80 t84 t55 t39 t29 t83 t57 t71 t37 t28 t55 t77.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to try smaller sections.\n\nLet me consider that each production for a non-terminal can be represented as two symbols, each of which can be a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for example, if a non-terminal X has a production X \u2192 a b, then to derive a string starting with a, the string must start with a, followed by whatever comes from b.\n\nSimilarly, for X \u2192 Y Z, Y and Z can be any non-terminals or terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is large and complex, perhaps it's more efficient to look for the string to consist only of a sequence where each pair of consecutive elements can be derived from some production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so each step must involve non-terminals being expanded until they produce terminals.\n\nBut since the entire string is a series of terminals, every non-terminal in the derivation must eventually produce a terminal. So, each production path from the root to a terminal must generate the string correctly.\n\nI think this could be challenging without a more systematic approach. Maybe I can start from the beginning and see if each terminal can be matched by some production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the string to contain the necessary terminals in a way that each production allows the next step.\n\nFor example, let's see if 't41' is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see NT22 can produce 't77', and others. Wait, looking for 't41', I notice that in the grammar, NT24 -> t14, but that's not t41. Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT34 -> t3\n\n- NT33 -> t55\n\n- NT22 -> t77\n\n- NT19 -> t47\n\n- NT15 -> t65\n\n- NT22 -> t50 (wait, earlier I thought NT22 has another rule: in the first given list, 'NT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nWait, wait, looking back, the grammar has multiple entries for some non-terminals. For example, NT22 has:\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\n\nNT22 -> NT10\n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think I might misread the grammar rules. Let me parse the grammar again more carefully.\n\nThe grammar is given with each line as S -> NTa NTb NTc (assuming triple?), but actually, I think each line is S->NTa NTb.

{"custom_id":"request-705","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S, and the string we're evaluating starts with multiple tokens. I think each token might correspond to a production rule derivation step, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol S generates NT6 and NT34. So, the string should start with the symbols derived from NT6 and NT34. Let's parse the string token by token.\n\nThe string is: t20 t41 t14 t43 t22 t39 t28 t61 t57 t52 t54 t14 t77 t53 t43 t29 t43 t47 t36 t47 t14 t47 t29 t68 t0 t61 t65 t65 t36 t3 t40 t57 t49 t12 t52 t36 t73 t49 t40 t22 t41 t37 t65 t40.\n\nEach token like t20, t41, etc., corresponds to a non-terminal that has a production which results in that terminal. For example, if there's a production NT20 \u2192 t45, then when NT20 is used, it's replaced by t45.\n\nI think the approach here is to simulate the derivation steps starting from S. Since S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the first step is to see if the string starts with the concatenation of NT6 and NT34. So the first two tokens should be whatever NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLooking at the NT6 productions, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT35 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nWait, maybe I should check each production for NT6.

{"custom_id":"request-709","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the provided string is generated by this grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. First, I should probably understand how the grammar works and what the start symbol is. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34, so the start symbol is S. The string I have to evaluate is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t73 t83 t84 t47 t81 t50 t52 t77 t22 t45 t50 t25 t68 t23 t72 t0 t35 t84 t40 t67 t45 t28 t29 t61 t28 t22 t73 t23 t0 t37 t28 t68 t35 t68 t39 t39 t45 t0 t84 t53 t30 t23 t38 t61`.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string using the given grammar. If I can successfully derive the string from S, then it's in the language. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nGiven that it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production is non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut wait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT34. So I start with S, which must be replaced by NT6 and NT34. Then each of those non-terminals can be expanded further according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each 't...' is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals correspond directly to specific terminals.\n\nFor example, looking at the productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT6 -> 't20'\nNT14 -> 't72'\nNT20 -> 't45'\nNT1 -> 't29'\nNT6 -> 't33 NT19' or 't27 NT19'\nWait, but some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT15 -> 't65', NT19 -> 't47', NT22 -> 't77', etc.\n\nSo the strategy is to try to match the string by applying the grammar's productions, ensuring that each terminal in the string is matched by the appropriate production.\n\nAlternatively, constructing a parse tree from the string and seeing if it can be derived using the grammar.\n\nBut doing this manually might be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if certain sequences must come from specific non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start the parse and see if the string can be completely broken down using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to do this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t73 t83 t84 t47 t81 t50 t52 t77 t22 t45 t50 t25 t68 t23 t72 t0 t35 t84 t40 t67 t45 t28 t29 t61 t28 t22 t73 t23 t0 t37 t28 t68 t35 t68 t39 t39 t45 t0 t84 t53 t30 t23 t38 t61.\n\nThis is a long string of 44 tokens. I need to see if each of these can be matched by the grammar's rules.\n\nStarting with S: it produces NT6 and NT34. So the string must start with NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nLooking at the first token: t73. So let's see which non-terminals produce 't73'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't73' and another production: NT7 -> 't73' only. Wait, no: looking back, in the grammar, NT7 is defined as:\n\nNT7 -> 't73' and another production? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the given context, there's a line:\n\nNT7 -> 't66' and another line:\n\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nYes, so NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'.\n\nSo, for the first token t73, NT7 can be either t73 or t66. Since the first token is t73, I need to see which production in NT7 can give me that.\n\nIn the grammar, NT7's productions are:\n\nNT7 -> 't66' and NT7 -> 't73'.\n\nSo if the first token is t73, then NT7 must have been expanded to 't73'. So that's one possibility.\n\nWait a second, but I thought S starts with NT6 and NT34. So in the parse, the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nThus, the first part of the string should come from NT6, followed by NT34. So the first token, t73, would have to come from NT6 or NT34.\n\nWait, no: in the production S \u2192 NT6 NT34, this means that NT6 and NT34 are the first two symbols to be directly produced. So in the string, the first token is t73, which comes from NT6 or NT34.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT6 can produce several things. Let me check:\n\nNT6's productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nWait, so NT6 can produce a combination of two non-terminals or also directly produce 't20'.\n\nBut the first token is t73, so it must come from a non-terminal that can produce t73, which is either NT7->'t73' or other NTs? Wait, do any other non-terminals produce 't73'? Let me see: looking through the grammar, only NT7 has 't73'.\n\nSo, if the first token is t73, then that must come from a NT that produces 't73', which is only NT7. But in the initial expansion, S produces NT6 and NT34. So they must be the first two symbols. Therefore, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT6 and NT34 in that order.\n\nSo the first token is t73. But NT6 doesn't have a production that produces 't73' directly or via another path? Wait, let's double-check.\n\nNT6's productions:\n\nNT6 can expand into NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT21 NT25, NT17 NT7, or directly 't20'. Wait, but 't20' is only one token. So if the first token is t73, which is not 't20', the NT6 can't produce t73 directly because none of its productions directly produce 't73'; the only NT that produces t73 is NT7, and S\u2192NT6 NT34, so NT6 can't directly produce t73 in one step.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the initial assumption must be wrong. Then how does the first token t73 come from NT6?\n\nAh, maybe more steps are needed. Because in the grammar, we can have multiple steps of expansion.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the string starts with NT7, not S. But no, S must be the start symbol, so it should expand first.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a left or right recursion involved. Let me check: looking through the grammar, I don't see any left recursion, as most productions are of the form A->BC. So left recursion isn't present.\n\nWait, but if S is S\u2192NT6 NT34, then the first two symbols should be the first two components of these, i.e., if NT6 expands to something that starts with t73, or maybe NT34 does.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the expansion, after a few steps, NT6 or NT34 can produce a sequence leading to t73.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can look for a path that starts with S and leads to the first token t73.\n\nSince S\u2192NT6 NT34, the first two symbols are the first symbols of NT6's expansion and NT34's expansion.\n\nSo the first symbol is t73, which must be the first symbol generated by NT6 or NT34.\n\nLooking into NT34's productions:\n\nCheck the grammar for NT34. I see:\n\nNT34 -> 't3' and NT34 -> 't55' and others? Let me look:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT34 -> 't3' and NT34 -> 't55'. Also, NT34 is produced by itself in some lines:\n\nWait, in the given grammar, looking through, I see:\n\nNT34 is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The strategy is to try to derive the string step by step using the productions.

So the string must start with the expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLet me look at NT6. From the grammar, NT6 can produce two options: NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19. Wait, looking again, the user input shows some duplicates. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT6 productions: The user listed NT6 as:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, it's:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nYes, two productions. So NT6 can go to either NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 \u2192 't3'. So the string starts with NT6 NT34, so the first part is NT6, which must expand into either NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19, followed by NT34 which is 't3'.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t45 t55... So the first part, after S, needs to expand to something that starts with t45.\n\nLooking at NT6's expansions:\n\nCase 1: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nCase 2: NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nLooking at NT27 and NT33, see if they can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nNT27 can be:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nor NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n\nWait, no, looking back: NT27's productions are:\n\nFrom the user's grammar:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n\nAlso, in the user's list, under NT27, it's:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18\n\nSo NT27 can produce either NT7 NT7 or NT12 NT18.\n\nBut wait, earlier in the user's grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT12 NT18.\n\nSo if NT27 is used, it needs to be broken down into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT33's productions are:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nand\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT21 NT17\n\nWait, in the user's grammar, under NT33:\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT21 NT17\n\nSo NT33 expands into either NT31 NT17 or NT21 NT17.\n\nAlso, looking at NT31, it has several productions:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 (left recursive, possible infinite loop)\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\nWait, actually, looking back:\n\nFrom the user's grammar, NT31 has:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT35 (Wait, no, under NT31, looking again:\n\nThe user's grammar lists:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT35 NT25\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, context-free grammars are defined by production rules. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided has non-terminals like S, NT14, NT20, etc., and terminals like 't77', 't47', etc. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t53 t80 t10 t72 t10 t72 t25 t22 t23 t0 t30 t14 t54 t38 t83 t38 t83 t57 t28 t40 t40 t36 t14 t72 t83 t55 t10 t50 t38 t55 t28 t53 t49 t47 t35 t73 t55 t11 t39 t18 t68 t49 t41 t23 t52`.\n\nI need to see if this string is in the language generated by the grammar. To do this, I can try constructing a parse tree using the productions, starting from S and breaking down the string step by step.\n\nLet's start by looking at the grammar rules:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34\n   So the string must start with NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is 't53 t80 t10 ...'. Let's match this with NT6 and NT34.\n\n2. NT34 \u2192 t3\n   So the second part of S is 't3'. Looking at the string, after 't53', the second part is 't80 t10 ...'. Wait, that doesn't match 't3'. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the entire string is the concatenation of NT6 and NT34. Therefore, the string must split into two parts: the first part derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nFirst part: 't53 t80 t10 t72 t10 t72 t25 t22 t23 t0 t30 t14 t54 t38 t83 t38 t83 t57 t28 t40 t40 t36 t14 t72 t83 t55 t10 t50 t38 t55 t28 t53 t49 t47 t35 t73 t55 t11 t39 t18 t68 t49 t41 t23 t52'\n\nSecond part: the string starting from t53, but that's the entire string. Wait, no. Let's correct: the string is split into two parts by S. So the first part must be NT6 and the second part NT34.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, after NT6, the next part is NT34.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to parse the string step by step.\n\nBut maybe it's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can see if each symbol in the string can be derived by the rules.\n\nLet me check the start symbol S \u2192 NT6 NT34.

{"custom_id":"request-731","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this grammar problem to solve, and honestly, it's a bit intimidating at first glance. But let's break it down step by step. The question is about determining whether a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar provided. CNF grammars have production rules where the left side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier for algorithms like CYK to parse the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that it's quite large with a lot of non-terminals. The production rules are all in the form of S -> NT..., and each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. That's good. Now, the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's with numbers, like 't29 t72 t39 ...' and so on. \n\nSince it's a CNF grammar, the string length should match the derivation steps. Specifically, for a string of length n, the number of symbols should be 2^(n-1). Let me count the number of tokens in the string. It seems like each 't' is a separate token, so let's count them:\n\nt29, t72, t39, t20, t45, t55, t3, t73, t37, t11, t25, t45, t37, t80, t55, t80, t23, t54, t47, t29, t61, t83, t43, t80, t65, t14, t18, t45, t66, t28, t71, t37, t3, t25, t55, t30, t12, t3, t38, t61, t36, t23, t61, t72, t39, t10.\n\nLet me count these. Hmm, 47 tokens. For a string of length n in CNF, the total number of symbols in the derivation should be 2^(n-1). Let's check: 2^(47-1) is 2^46, which is a huge number, way more than we have. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I misunderstood.\n\nWait, no, I think I need to think differently. In CNF, the derivation starts with the start symbol and each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal). So each step increases the number of symbols by 1. Thus, starting from 1 symbol (the start symbol S), after k steps, the number of symbols is 1 + k.\n\nBut the string has 47 tokens, so the number of steps would be 46. But how does that relate to the start symbol? Hmm, maybe that's a red herring because the string length is 47, which suggests it's a leftmost derivation of 46 steps from S. Each step would expand until the leaves are terminals.\n\nBut wait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be constructed by the grammar. Each symbol in the string must be either a terminal that appears on the right-hand side of a production or a non-terminal that can derive to the next token.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't29'. So I need to see if any production rule directly produces 't29'. Looking at the grammar, I see several productions where terminals are listed, like NT1 -> 't61', NT6 -> 't20', etc. Scanning through, I find:\n\nWait, let me list all the terminal productions given:\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT1 -> 't29'\nNT6 -> 't20'\nNT6 -> 't33' ('t33' is different)\nWait, I see:\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT1 -> 't29'\nNT4 -> 't29'\nWait, yes, looking at the productions, there are two rules that produce 't29':\nNT1 -> 't29'\nNT4 -> 't29'\n\nSo the first token is 't29', which can be produced by either NT1 or NT4. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nAssuming we choose NT1 first, then the next step is to expand NT1, which is part of NT14 and other rules. Looking at the grammar, NT14's production is NT2 NT1, meaning it's composed of two non-terminals, NT2 and NT1.\n\nWait, but that's going too deep. Maybe another approach: since the string is a sequence of terminals, each must be the result of a production. Let's see the entire string:\n\nt29, t72, t39, t20, t45, t55, t3, t73, t37, t11, t25, t45, t37, t80, t55, t80, t23, t54, t47, t29, t61, t83, t43, t80, t65, t14, t18, t45, t66, t28, t71, t37, t3, t25, t55, t30, t12, t3, t38, t61, t36, t23, t61, t72, t39, t10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and we can use the fact that in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So the entire string must be a leftmost derivation starting from S and ending with the given string.\n\nBut it's more efficient to use theCYK algorithm, which parses the given string according to the grammar. However, manually applying CYK would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down based on the available productions.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't29', which comes from NT1 or NT4. Let's take NT1 first.\n\nNT1 is defined as NT14 -> NT2 NT1.\nSo NT14 is NT2 NT1. So the first step is NT14 -> NT2 NT1. Then NT1 is 't29' or another option.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the entire string and see if each terminal can be found in the grammar and if the sequence makes sense based on the productions.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string:\n\n't29', 't72', 't39', 't20', 't45', 't55', 't3', 't73', 't37', 't11', 't25', 't45', 't37', 't80', 't55', 't80', 't23', 't54', 't47', 't29', 't61', 't83', 't43', 't80', 't65', 't14', 't18', 't45', 't66', 't28', 't71', 't37', 't3', 't25', 't55', 't30', 't12', 't3', 't38', 't61', 't36', 't23', 't61', 't72', 't39', 't10'.\n\nEach of these terminals must appear in some production rule as the right-hand side. Let me check each one:\n\nt29: exists as NT1 -> 't29' and NT4 -> 't29'\nt72: NT27 -> 't72', NT14 -> 't72' (from NT6 production), etc.\nt39: NT22 -> 't39' (from NT6 production)\nt20: NT2 -> 't20'\nt45: NT20 -> 't45' (from NT15 production)\nt55: NT33 -> 't55' (from NT33 production)\nt3: NT27 -> 't73' and another rule\nWait, t3 appears in several places, like NT27 -> 't72'? No, checking NT27: NT27 -> 't72' and another -> 't73' and also NT27 -> 't72'? Wait, looking back, the production for NT27 is NT27 -> 't72' and NT27 -> 't73'?

{"custom_id":"request-725","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar starts with the start symbol S, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies the grammar, making it easier to analyze with parsers like the CYK algorithm. However, since I'm manually trying to determine if the string is generated, I might not need the CYK method here.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it's defined as S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first two symbols of any string generated by this grammar must be NT6 and NT34. Similarly, each non-terminal breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals. My goal is to trace from S down to the string, replacing non-terminals step by step until I get all terminals.\n\nThe string given is: `t3 t71 t37 t65 t61 t80 t67 t67 t83 t11 t3 t40 t23 t67 t55 t22 t45 t52 t55 t54 t38 t52 t40 t68 t47 t12 t67 t77 t55 t20 t54 t53 t39 t84 t43 t41 t40 t0 t61 t39 t3 t0 t38 t20 t49 t35`\n\nI'll break it down into tokens:\n\n1. t3\n2. t71\n3. t37\n4. t65\n5. t61\n6. t80\n7. t67\n8. t67\n9. t83\n10. t11\n11. t3\n12. t40\n13. t23\n14. t67\n15. t55\n16. t22\n17. t45\n18. t52\n19. t55\n20. t54\n21. t38\n22. t52\n23. t40\n24. t68\n25. t47\n26. t12\n27. t67\n28. t77\n29. t55\n30. t20\n31. t54\n32. t53\n33. t39\n34. t84\n35. t43\n36. t41\n37. t40\n38. t0\n39. t61\n40. t39\n41. t3\n42. t0\n43. t38\n44. t20\n45. t49\n46. t35\n\nThe string has 46 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but in CNF, it's two non-terminals or a terminal). So each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols, but in this case, I need to see if the tokens can be derived from S through these steps.\n\nBut with 46 tokens, it's a lot to track. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards from the start symbol S and see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the first tokens: t3 and t71. Wait, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So NT6 and NT34 should correspond to the first two tokens. But the first token is t3, which must be either a terminal or come from a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, NT6 has multiple productions. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, etc. So NT6 can produce t3 if one of its productions leads to t3. Looking at the grammar, I see NT34 \u2192 t3. So if NT34 directly produces t3, then that's possible.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which would make the first two symbols NT6 and NT34, but in the string, the first two are t3 and t71. Hmm, that doesn't match because NT6 would start with something that produces t3, but in the string, it's t3 followed by t71. So perhaps that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the non-terminals are all named NT followed by numbers. Each of these non-terminals can produce a combination of other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nFor example, NT6 can produce NT27 NT19, or NT33 NT19, etc. Meanwhile, NT34 has a production to t3, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is t3, which would come from NT34. But S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the first two non-terminals would need to produce t3 and another non-terminal, but the string starts with t3 followed by t71.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the first two symbols must be the results of NT6 and NT34. So the first symbol should come from NT6, and the second symbol from NT34.\n\nIn the string, the first symbol is t3, which comes from NT34 (since NT34 \u2192 t3). But the production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so NT6 would produce the first symbol, and NT34 would produce the second.\n\nBut in the string, the first two symbols are t3 and t71. So that would require NT6 to produce t3, but looking at the grammar, does NT6 produce t3?\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT6: NT6 can go to NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT21 NT25, etc., but I don't see any production where NT6 directly produces a terminal except maybe in the rules listed. Wait, looking back, under NT6, there are multiple productions, but none of them directly produce t3 except for NT34 and others.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, the rules for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\nNT6 \u2192 NT14 NT31\nNT6 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 NT6 seems to go on, but none of the NT6 productions end with a terminal like t3. So NT6 cannot directly produce t3. That means the first symbol in the string, t3, cannot come from NT6. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the first symbol is from NT6, which cannot be t3 because NT6's productions don't include any terminals except through other non-terminals. So unless NT6 can produce t3 through a chain of productions, but looking at NT34's rules, NT34 is a terminal, so it's only NT34 \u2192 t3. So unless NT6 can somehow derive to t3, but from the given rules, I don't see that.\n\nSo the initial step is that S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Therefore, the first symbol must be from NT6, which can only produce non-terminals, not terminals. So the first token being t3, which is a terminal, cannot come from NT6. Therefore, the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check if any non-terminal in NT6 can ultimately produce a terminal, especially t3. For example, if NT6 can derive to a terminal t3 through some chain, but from the given rules, it seems that NT6's productions involve other non-terminals. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT14 NT31\n\nNone of these end with a terminal. So NT6 cannot produce a terminal directly or indirectly, only through other non-terminals. Therefore, the first symbol, t3, cannot be produced by NT6. Hence, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo the conclusion is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, but in the grammar, NT17 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and then NT7 can produce 't72' or also 't66'? Wait no, looking back, NT7 has two productions: NT7 \u2192 NT77 and NT7 \u2192 NT66.

Or wait, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar entries:\n\nI see NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't73'. So NT7 can be t66 or t73.\n\nBut the string has t40, which isn't a terminal, so it must come from a non-terminal. Let me check NT6 and NT34.\n\nNT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19. So if we apply NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, each of these needs to produce a terminal.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. So NT27 would produce two terminals. Each NT7 can be t66 or t73.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first token is t40, which isn't produced by NT27. Hmm. Maybe I need to find a way from NT6 to get to t40.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider building the parse tree starting from S.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\n\nSo the string should be a concatenation of the strings derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: after S starts with t40, which is the first token. So let's see how the string can be split into two parts, one from NT6 and one from NT34.\n\nWait, but the entire string is quite long, so it's easier to check if each part can be broken down recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at each production and see if their symbols are among the given ones. Wait, but the string uses t12, t45, t36, etc., so maybe I should find a sequence of productions that leads to these tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if each non-terminal in the grammar can be reduced to the string.\n\nLet me start with the first part: after S, the next symbols are t40, t12, t45, t36, t71, t53, t53, t25, t12, t25, t65, t37, t12, t0,...\n\nWait, but according to the grammar, S starts with NT6 and NT34, so the string should be the concatenation of two parts: one from NT6 and one from NT34.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts. Maybe the first part is up to t49 or something. But perhaps a better approach is to see if each part can be reduced.\n\nWait, maybe I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the string must start as NT6 NT34. Let me see if the beginning can be derived.\n\nLooking at NT6's production: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19.\n\nSo the string starts with NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19.\n\nChecking the string: first token is t40. If NT27 NT19 produces t40, then we would need NT27 to produce t40, but looking at the grammar, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and each NT7 \u2192 t66 or t73. So that can't produce t40. Alternatively, if NT33 is producing a terminal... Checking NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17 or NT31 NT7.\n\nLooking at the terminals for these: NT31 has two productions, but none directly producing a 't' except through other non-terminals. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. NT31 has a production where it can go to NT22 NT0 or other terminals. Looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT31:\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 (recursive)\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7 (also recursive)\nNT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19 (from some place)\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT22 (recursive)\nAnd also, it has some terminals:\nNT22 \u2192 't10' or others, but in the earlier list, NT22 is also in other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because some non-terminals directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'.\nNT17 \u2192 't66'.\nNT22 \u2192 't22', 't77', or others.

{"custom_id":"request-741","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, but I'm not exactly sure how to use that. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, looking at the grammar rules, they all seem to follow this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 breaks into two non-terminals, and many other rules have two non-terminals separated by an arrow. Some rules directly produce terminals, like NT10 \u2192 't77' or NT1 \u2192 't61'. So, that's good.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t20 t23 t37 t67 t47 t52 t25 t35 t29 t40 t73 t18 t84 t84 t54 t54 t80 t68 t68 t45 t20 t35 t49 t12 t40 t41 t41 t71 t39 t49 t80 t36 t73 t10 t25 t25 t25 t49 t65 t29 t30 t45 t57 t43 t39 t39 t81`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules.\n\nTo approach this, I think I can model the derivation process by tracking the non-terminals and terminals step by step. Each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, and so on until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nStarting with S, the first rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, S must start with NT6 followed by NT34. Let's break down both NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or 't20'\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, for NT34, it directly becomes 't3'. But in the string, the first part starts with 't20'. Wait, that might be a problem because S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and if NT34 is 't3', then S \u2192 NT6 t3. But the string starts with 't20', so that suggests that either S's expansion is incorrect, or maybe NT34 goes somewhere else. Wait, no: the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the entire string must be NT6 followed by NT34. But NT34 is either 't3' or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. NT34 has the rule NT34 \u2192 't3', but that's the only rule for NT34. So regardless of other expansions, NT34 produces 't3'. That would mean S, in the first step, would produce NT6 followed by 't3'. But the string starts with 't20', which is a terminal. So unless NT6 \u2192 't20' immediately, which it does (as per the rules: NT6 \u2192 't20'), but that's for NT6 \u2192 terminal. So in S \u2192 NT6 NT34, that would be NT6 (\u2192 t20) and NT34 (\u2192 t3), making S \u2192 t20 t3. But the string is longer, so maybe S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which becomes t20 t3, but the string is longer, so perhaps NT6 can expand further. Wait, I'm confused.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S's expansion starts with NT6 followed by NT34. So in the string, the entire sequence must start with whatever NT6 produces followed by whatever NT34 produces. But NT34 is 't3' according to the rules, right? Because the grammar is in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So NT34 is a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t20, then t23, etc. So that suggests that NT6 must expand to t20 followed by NT34, which is t3. But the string starts with t20, so that would mean that t20 t3 is the first part, but the string is much longer. Therefore, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look into the structure of the grammar more carefully. Perhaps there are other paths where S can expand further. Wait, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is the only rule for S. So S can only expand into NT6 and NT34, nothing else. Therefore, the string must start with whatever NT6 produces followed by NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6: multiple rules, including NT6 \u2192 't20', which is a terminal. So if NT6 is 't20', then the first token of the string is t20, as in the input. Then NT34 is 't3', so the next part is t3. So the first two tokens would be t20 t3, but in the string, it's t20 followed by t23, t37, etc. That suggests that either the NT6 doesn't directly produce t20, or NT34 doesn't produce t3. But that can't be because the rules define NT6 \u2192 't20' and NT34 \u2192 't3'. So perhaps the input is not compatible with the grammar because the first token is t20, which could come from NT6, but after that, NT34 should produce t3, which doesn't match the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but no, actually, maybe NT6 can produce more complicated sequences. For example, NT6 might expand further into other non-terminals, which themselves expand further.\n\nLooking back, NT6 has the following rules:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT20 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19 (but wait, NT34 is 't3', so that would mean NT6 \u2192 t3 NT19, which isn't useful because NT19 is another non-terminal.)\n\nWait, no, let me check NT6. From the rules, NT6 can go to several non-terminals, but the terminal 't20' is only for NT6's another rule. Wait, looking again, here's the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT20 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT34 NT19\n\nWait, is NT34 a non-terminal with a rule? Looking at the initial grammar: yes, NT34 \u2192 't3'. So NT6 can also produce NT34 if that's allowed, but since NT34 is a terminal, that's a rule for NT6 to produce 't3' followed by 't19'? No, wait, the arrows are rules, so NT6 \u2192 NT34 would require NT34 to be followed by NT19. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So for NT6, each rule is either pairing it with another non-terminal (like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19) or producing a terminal, like 't20'. So in the first step, S is NT6 followed by NT34. Since NT34 can only be 't3', that would mean S's first expansion produces NT6 (which could be various things) followed by 't3'. So the string should start with whatever NT6 produces followed by t3. But the string's first token is t20, so that suggests NT6 must produce 't20' as a terminal, which is allowed. Then, the expansion would be t20 followed by NT34, which is t3.\n\nBut then the rest of the string after t20 should be t3, but the string continues as t23, t37, etc. So that's a problem because after t20 t3, we shouldn't have any other tokens.\n\nWait, but maybe NT6 can produce more than just 't20' or other non-terminals. Perhaps, NT6 can go into NT20, which is another non-terminal with its own rules. Let me check NT20. Looking at the grammar rules, NT20 \u2192 NT14 NT31 or NT2 \u2192 NT0 NT20. So NT20 can split into two non-terminals, which themselves split further.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should consider parsing the string from the start, keeping track of possible reductions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the entire string must be a substitution of NT6 and NT34.

{"custom_id":"request-743","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the grammar is given with a bunch of production rules. CNF structures each production to have exactly two non-terminals on the left, except for the start symbol, which can be a single non-terminal. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a terminal symbol, which seems to be a string like 't67' or 't0'.\n\nI remember that a key feature of CNF is that every production produces two non-terminals or a terminal. The grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34, which is two non-terminals. The string starts with 't67' and then 't38', so I need to see how these tokens can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to see which non-terminals produce 't67' or 't38'. Scanning through, I notice that NT11 -> NT27 NT28 might be a starting point. Wait, no, NT11's productions are looking at NT27 and NT28. Let me see what those produce. NT27 has rules: one of them is 't72' and another is 't73'. So if NT11 is NT27 and NT28, then production could lead to 't72' or 't73'. But the string starts with 't67', which isn't directly from NT27.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string. S -> NT6 NT34, so both NT6 and NT34 need to generate the string's tokens.\n\nLet me check the productions for NT6. There are several rules, like NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> 't20'. The string starts with 't67', which isn't an immediate production from NT6. So probably, this process will involve more steps.\n\nWait, looking again, maybe NT11 is involved because 't67' appears in the string a couple of times. NT11 has productions NT27 NT28 and NT27 NT28 again but with different rules. Hmm, so starting from NT11, it can go to 't72' or 't73' via NT27 and NT28. But the string starts with 't67', which isn't generated by any of the immediate rules of NT6 or NT34.\n\nWait, let me look at NT7: NT7 -> 't72' or 't73'. Oh, that's from NT7. So maybe somewhere there's a step where NT7 could produce 't72' or 't73', but the string has 't67' which isn't directly matched by these.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a recursive approach. Starting from S, which is NT6 NT34. Let's see what NT6 can do. One of the rules for NT6 is 't20', another is NT27 NT19. The string starts with 't67', so maybe NT6 needs to generate 't67'. Let's see if 't67' can be produced by any rule from NT6. Looking at NT6's rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (again)\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25 (again)\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT20\nWait, no, looking again, the rules for NT6 are:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 -> NT21 NT25 again?\nWait, no, the duplicates might be a typo, but checking the list:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nBTW, there are duplicates but that's okay.\n\nSo, none of these directly produce a terminal. The terminal 't67' must come from a deeper derivation, via a chain of productions.\n\nSo, starting with NT6, which generates NT27 NT19, then each of those non-terminals must produce the next token.\n\nWait, let me clarify: The string is a series of terminals, so each token in the string must come from a production chain starting from S.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can model the string as a sequence of productions. But this could get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, every production is between two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation tree is a binary tree where each node has two children. Therefore, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n - 1, where n is the depth of the tree. Let me count the tokens in the string.\n\nThe string is: t67 t38 t77 t80 t35 t55 t61 t54 t71 t36 t83 t55 t54 t61 t49 t41 t71 t11 t71 t29 t84 t49 t22 t14 t23 t72 t52 t57 t29 t71 t72 t67 t77 t49 t0 t23 t25 t73 t77 t73 t28 t49 t14 t73 t12 t83 t67 t43.\n\nCounting these: Let's see, each space is a token. I can count them one by one.\n\n1: t67\n2: t38\n3: t77\n4: t80\n5: t35\n6: t55\n7: t61\n8: t54\n9: t71\n10: t36\n11: t83\n12: t55\n13: t54\n14: t61\n15: t49\n16: t41\n17: t71\n18: t11\n19: t71\n20: t29\n21: t84\n22: t49\n23: t22\n24: t14\n25: t23\n26: t72\n27: t52\n28: t57\n29: t29\n30: t71\n31: t72\n32: t67\n33: t77\n34: t49\n35: t0\n36: t23\n37: t25\n38: t73\n39: t77\n40: t73\n41: t28\n42: t49\n43: t14\n44: t73\n45: t12\n46: t83\n47: t67\n48: t43\n\nTotal of 48 tokens. So the length is 48. Since in CNF, each production adds one token at each level of the tree, the length of the string is 2^n -1. So 48 +1=49. Is 49 a power of 2? 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 49 isn't, so n isn't an integer. That suggests it's either not possible, but that's just a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nBut that might mean it's not a problem, as the string's length might be permissible. Alternatively, perhaps some other considerations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the string can't be broken down due to certain productions not existing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try to trace the derivation.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the first token must be generated by NT6, then NT34.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't67', which isn't directly produced by NT6 or NT34. So maybe S produces NT6 NT34, which then each of those produces their own sequence.\n\nLet's consider NT6 generating 't67'. Looking for a path where NT6 can produce 't67'. Looking through the NT6 rules:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n4. Others are either same or more.\n\nNone of these produce a terminal. So 't67' must come from a deeper node.\n\nWait, perhaps the string's first token 't67' comes from NT11, which has a production NT27 NT28, but then each of those"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, especially when they're in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. A grammar is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal and so on. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production must produce exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So looking at the productions, I see some have three parts? Wait, no, in the provided grammar, each production seems to have two symbols on the RHS. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, etc. So each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals? Wait, but that's not possible because in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols on the RHS. So maybe the way it's written, like NT6 is a non-terminal, so each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C can be either non-terminals or terminals? Or is it that in CNF, the productions have to be of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, and no terminals are allowed on the RHS except for the case where A \u2192 a. Hmm, perhaps the given grammar is in a mix of forms, but maybe it's supposed to be in CNF with only two symbols on the RHS, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production can only have two symbols on the RHS, both non-terminals. Because if you have a terminal, that complicates things, but perhaps the given grammar is in a form where it's more complex. Wait, looking more carefully, the productions have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4, which seems okay because it's two non-terminals. But then, in the second production for NT15 \u2192 't65'\u2014wait, no, looking at the provided grammar, some of the productions are things like NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4, NT15 \u2192 't65', and others. Wait, no, actually, the grammar seems to have a mix. For example, NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4 is one production, but earlier in the user's problem, some lines have 't' strings like NT15 \u2192 't65'. Wait, looking back, the user provided a list of productions where some produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal or a terminal and a terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps the user's grammar is not in CNF, but the user says it is. Hmm, maybe the grammar as provided by the user doesn't strictly adhere to CNF because some productions have three symbols on the RHS, like certain NT15 \u2192 NT6 NT19, which is three terms.

For example, NT22 has multiple productions, but some are to terminals and non-terminals. But in CNF, each production should have exactly two symbols on the RHS except for terminals. So perhaps in this grammar, all productions except for the terminals are of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. Let me check some examples:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21: That's two non-terminals, so okay.\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15: Two non-terminals, okay.\n\nNT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4: Two non-terminals.\n\nBut some productions have a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT19 \u2192 't47', which is terminal. Similarly, NT20 \u2192 't77', which is a terminal. Oh, so the grammar is not strictly in CNF because some productions produce a terminal and a non-terminal together. CNF requires that each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So in this case, the RHS can be two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo I'm confused because the user said it's in CNF, but some productions seem to have two non-terminals followed by a terminal. Or maybe the user made a mistake in writing the productions. Wait, looking at NT19 again: NT19 \u2192 't47' and NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21. Wait, but 't47' is a single terminal, not a combination of two non-terminals and a terminal. So perhaps the user's grammar isn't in CNF because some productions have more than one non-terminal and a terminal in the RHS.\n\nHmm, maybe the user intended it to be, and the way the productions are written is causing confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is in CNF, and the presence of two non-terminals in some productions and a terminal in others is permissible because the productions are either of the form A \u2192 a or A \u2192 BC.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, with B and C being non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-755","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which makes each production either a single terminal, or a combination of two non-terminals. The string given is a sequence of 't' tokens followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, let me parse the string. The string is: \n\nt0 t3 t47 t30 t68 t39 t39 t36 t40 t71 t52 t18 t37 t80 t39 t68 t65 t84 t43 t25 t77 t41 t23 t50 t65 t41 t72 t29 t3 t50 t40 t83 t47 t65 t22 t28 t68 t80 t53 t67 t20 t22 t14 t83 t22 t77 t52 t0 t36\n\nI notice that some parts repeat, like t0, t3, t47, etc. Since the grammar has a structure where certain non-terminals produce specific terminals, I can try to map the sequence back through the grammar.\n\nLet me look at the top-level production: S -> NT6 NT34\n\nSo the string should start with NT6 followed by NT34. Let me check the first part of the string: t0 t3 ?\n\nWait, NT6 and NT34 are sequences that must derive into these terminals or combinations. Let me check the productions for NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT6 can produce several things, including NT27 NT19 and NT33 NT19 and others, but also directly 't20' in some cases. Wait, in my earlier analysis, some of the NT6 productions produce 't20' directly, like NT6 -> 't20', etc. Wait no, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT6 has multiple productions, including NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT66 etc., but there's one rule where NT6 -> 't20'. Let me check.\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo if NT6 produces 't20', then in the string, t0 is likely the result of NT6 producing t0. Wait, no, because looking at the NT6 rules, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19, but also NT6 -> 't20' in some cases. But in the string, the first token is t0, which might come from NT6?\n\nWait, no, wait. The S production starts with NT6 and NT34. So the string must start with NT6 producing a terminal or a non-terminal. If NT6 can produce 't20' directly, then the first token could be t20. But in the string, the first token is t0. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the grammar again. Oh wait, looking back, I see that NT6 has multiple rules, including NT6 -> 't20' and others like NT6 -> NT27 NT19, and NT6 -> NT33 NT19, and some other combinations. But also, I see that some of the non-terminals like NT2, NT21, etc., have rules that produce certain 't' tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0. So that must be the result of a production that eventually derives to t0. Let's see which non-terminals produce t0. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't66'\n\nWait, but that's in a sub-production. Let me check all the rules for producing t0 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT22 -> 't77' (multiple times)\n- NT27 -> 't72' and 't73' (maybe, but I need to check the exact rules)\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, in some cases the NTx produce specific 't' tokens, like:\n\nLooking through all the rules, here are some that produce specific 't' followed by numbers:\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT22 -> 't77' (several times)\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't66' and 't73'\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT25 -> 't49' and 't57'\n- NT24 -> 't14'\n- NT21 -> 't37', 't80', 't29', 't81', 't22'\n- NT10 -> 't12', 't14', etc.\n- NT19 -> 't23', 't47'\n- NT11 -> 't54', etc.\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- etc.\n\nSo, to get t0, the productions from NT0: NT0 -> 't66' is the only one that produces t66, but that's not t0. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, looking again through all the production rules, perhaps some non-terminal produces 't0' directly. Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking for any production of the form NTx -> 't0':\n\nWait, in the given grammar, do any non-terminals produce 't0' directly? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't66' (produces t66)\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT2 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't29'\nNT6 -> 't20' etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NTx that directly produce 't0'. So t0 must be the result of a non-terminal that eventually produces 't0'. That means t0 must come from a chain of productions where the end non-terminal eventually produces 't0' via some intermediate steps.\n\nLooking deeper, for example, if a non-terminal X has a production X->NTa NTb, and NTa->...->t0, then that could mean t0 is in the string.\n\nLooking through the string again, after t0 comes t3, then t47, t30, etc. So after t0, t3. Let me check what t3 could come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t3 is produced by NT14 (from the rules, I thought NT34 -> 't3', but checking, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT34 -> 't3'\n\nWait, yes, under the grammar:\n\nNT34 -> NT341? Wait, no, looking closely:\n\nIn the grammar, the rules include:\n\nNT34 -> 't3'\n\nYes, so NT34 can produce 't3' directly. So in the string, after t0, we have t3, which could be the result of NT34 producing 't3'. Alternatively, maybe a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the entire string must be built by expanding S into NT6 and NT34, then each of those must be expanded, and so on, and the entire string must be built by concatenation.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree from the string up to the root S, which must produce NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut given that, let's try to analyze the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t0, which as we saw, might be a terminal from a non-terminal that eventually produces t0. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any direct 't0' production from any non-terminal, so perhaps it's a chain where the non-terminal eventually leads to 't0'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial symbols are more straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as working backwards. The string must be a concatenation of the two parts derived from NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, the first part: t0, t3, t47, t30, t68, t39, etc.\n\nThen the second part: t43, t25, t77, etc., but wait, perhaps I'm wrong because the string is given as a single list, so the entire string must be derived from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the entire string as the concatenation of the two parts from NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, let's see: the string starts with t0, then t3, t47, ..., which I assume is the expansion of NT6, followed by t42, t25, etc., which"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are quite long, which might make it a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall what Chomsky Normal Form is. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that every non-terminal can only produce two other non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar provided starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the start symbol is S, and it immediately produces two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. To generate the string, we'll need to expand these, possibly recursively, until we get all terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't38', 't18', etc. These are all the terminals, so each one must be the result of a production rule that ends in a terminal.\n\nI think a good approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be traced back to the grammar. Let me see if I can find a way to map the string to the grammar's productions.\n\nBut wait, this string is 69 tokens long, and the grammar has around 50 non-terminals. I might need a strategy to look for possible derivations or maybe use a parsing approach, maybe like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar isn't in a standard form (like left-recursive), I might have to look for specific patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can build a parse tree from the string upwards to see if it can be derived from S.\n\nAnother thought: since the grammar is in CNF, I can represent the derivations in terms of how many steps they take. The string's length is 69 tokens. Since each production produces two symbols (non-terminals or terminals), the number of steps needed to generate all terminals is such that 2^n -1 >= 69. Let me calculate that. 2^7 is 128, so 2^7 -1 is 127, which is more than 69. So in theory, it's possible. But I don't know if the grammar actually allows that.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for each symbol in the string and see if it's present as a terminal in the grammar. The grammar has several terminals like t3, t5, etc., but I need to check the specific symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: the tokens are t38, t18, t20, t43, t12, t28, t50, t39, t29, t71, t54, t41, t38, t77, t25, t57, t12, t35, t52, t52, t83, t67, t50, t55, t81, t66, t50, t68, t22, t73, t29, t0, t84, t41, t84, t12, t29, t18, t52, t80, t40, t84, t50, t84, t41, t71, t73, t52, t83, t49.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see any terminals beyond what's listed. For example, does the grammar include, say, t77? Yes, I see NT19 \u2192 't47', NT15 \u2192 't65', and so on. But I should check if all the tokens in the string are covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking through the string, all the 't' tokens are within the format 'tXX' where XX is two-digit numbers. For example, t38 is covered because I see NT22 \u2192 't77', NT28 \u2192 't22', etc. Let me cross-verify each token:\n\n- t38: Look in the productions. NT22 \u2192 't77', but wait, maybe NT18 \u2192 't22', so perhaps NT22 is involved. Hmm, perhaps I can find t38 somewhere else. Looking, I see that some non-terminals like NT17, NT27, etc., all have terminals like t66, t67, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should check if each token in the string exists as a terminal in the grammar. If even one token isn't a terminal, then the string can't be generated. Let's go through the string tokens one by one.\n\nt38: Check if any production ends with 't38'. Looking at the productions, I see NT25 \u2192 't49', but no NT25 produces t38. Hmmm, is there any non-terminal that leads to 't38'? Looking back, I don't see any production that ends with t38 directly. So maybe 't38' is not present in the grammar. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any NT that produces 't38'. For example, NT10 \u2192 't84' and 't12', which are there. NT7 \u2192 t66 and t73. NT24 \u2192 't14' (but NT24 isn't a terminal). NT22 has multiple productions, but none of them end with t38. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar includes NT25 \u2192 't49', NT25 \u2192 't57'. But there's no 't38'. So perhaps 't38' isn't even a terminal in the grammar, which would mean the string can't be generated because S starts with NT6, which according to the productions includes 't20' and 't21' as possible terminals, but I need to check for 't38'.\n\nWait, let me look for 't38' in the productions. Scanning through the productions:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT27 \u2192 't73'\n- NT4 \u2192 multiple times, but no 't38'\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n- NT1 \u2192 't29'\n- etc.\n\nHmm, no productions directly generating 't38'. But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake because maybe the production NT22 \u2192 't43' and NT19 \u2192 't47' and other combos. Wait, maybe I'm missing 't38' elsewhere. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, none of them have 't38' as a terminal. So that already suggests that the string is invalid because one of the symbols, 't38', is not present in the grammar, which only produces specific terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's a typo. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me double-check the productions to make sure. Scanning all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n- NT24 \u2192 't14'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72' (two productions: 't72' and 't2')\n- NT6 appears multiple times, but not 't38'\n\nWait, in the NT6 \u2192 ... there are multiple productions that end with specific terminals. Wait, perhaps 't38' is only produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT22: 't77', 't25', 't77' (no, it's t77, t52?), wait, actually, I need to check all NT22 productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT22 has two productions:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nand then NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0 (but that's different). Wait no, let's see:\n\nWait, the full list of NT22 productions is:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I think I have:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77' (no, looking again, no.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I should remember has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let me take a look at the grammar rules. There are a lot of non-terminals (NT1 to NT33, and some double NT like NT12, NT22, etc.) and some terminals. Each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a single terminal. Since it's in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of t-commands and numbers, like t36 t65 t29 ..., up to t0 and then some other t and numbers. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first two symbols should correspond to the productions of NT6 and NT34. Looking at the productions for NT6, I see that it has multiple rules. Let's see which one could produce the initial part of the string.\n\nThe first symbol is t36. So, checking NT6's productions, one of them is NT6 \u2192 't36'. That would mean NT6 can directly produce t36. Similarly, for NT34, the string starts with t36, so NT6 can produce t36, and NT34 needs to produce the next part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two parts are t36 and t65. So, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 should expand to t36 (from NT6) and whatever NT34 expands to. Let's check NT34's productions. NT34 has NT34 \u2192 't34', but in the string, after t36 comes t65. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, the string starts with t36 followed by t65, but NT34 should produce t65. So let's check if NT34 can produce t65.\n\nLooking at NT34's productions, the only terminal is t34. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so NT34 must have a production that can produce t65. Wait, the given grammar for NT34 is 't34' according to the provided rules, because in the NT line, NT34 \u2192 't34'. So NT34 can only produce t34. But the string starts with t36, which is from NT6, and the next is t65, which is not produced by NT34. There's a contradiction here because S starts with NT6 NT34, which would produce t36 followed by whatever NT34 does, which is t34. But in the string, after t36, it's t65, which can't come from NT34's only production.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT6 again. The production for NT6 includes 't36'. Also, check other productions for NT6. Does NT6 have any other rule that could make t36 and then something else?\n\nLooking at the NT6 rules, yes: NT6 \u2192 't36' is one production. But how do the others fit? For example, another production for NT6 is 't27' and NT19, etc. So if NT6 is to produce t36, that part is satisfied. Then NT34 should produce t65, but according to the grammar, NT34 can only produce t34. That seems impossible.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. The start symbol S is the first symbol, so the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. If NT6 is 't36', then NT34 must produce t65, but the grammar only allows NT34 to produce t34. So that's a problem. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because after t36, it needs to have t65, but NT34 can't produce that. So the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT34 has another production. Let me scan all NT34 productions. In the provided rules, I see NT34 \u2192 't34'. That's the only rule for NT34. So no, it can't produce anything else.

So, in the derivation, the last step for NT34 would be to produce 't3'.\n\nNow, the start symbol S expands to NT6 and NT34.

Since the productions are applied in order, the string should be t20 followed by t3, which matches.\n\nIs there any other way this could be derived? Maybe taking NT6 to NT27 and NT19, but since NT27 and NT19 can be terminals or non-terminals, let me see what they are. \n\nLooking back, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, but these could further expand. Wait, NT27 \u2192 t72 (from NT27 -> t72), but wait, looking at the productions, I might have misread. Let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, NT27 has a production NT27 \u2192 t72? No, let me recheck the productions. From the given grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t66, NT7 \u2192 t73,\n\nNT6 \u2192 t20, etc.\n\nLooking at NT27: the productions are:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nBecause I see the rule NT27 -> NT7 NT7. But in the list above, the relevant part is:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nWait, but do we have any other production for NT27? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, there's NT27 -> NT7 NT7, and also NT27 \u2192 t72 is not present. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier because looking at the list provided, I might have missed some rules. Let me list the NT27 productions from the code.\n\nThe user provided a list of productions, and looking for NT27:\n\nNT27 appears only once, as:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nSo, NT27 doesn't produce any terminal directly. So if S expands to NT6 NT34, and we take NT6 as t20, that's fine. But if we don't, what happens? Let's explore that.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose to expand NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, then we have to process NT27 and NT19. Let's see what NT19 produces.\n\nLooking at NT19:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\nNT19 \u2192 t47 (from NT19 -> 't47')\n\nSo, NT19 can directly produce t47. So if we expand NT6 to NT27 NT19, then NT19 is t47. But in the string, we have t3, not t47. So that path won't give us the desired string. Therefore, the correct path must be expanding NT6 to t20, and NT34 to t3.\n\nWait, but let's verify that again. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Let's expand NT6 to t20, giving t20, and NT34 to t3, giving t3. So the string is t20 t3. That's exactly the given string. Therefore, the string is derivable.\n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused.

{"custom_id":"request-32","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has specific rules that make it easier to analyze. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided has a series of productions. Each non-terminal (like S, NT14, NT20, etc.) produces other non-terminals or terminals. The string to evaluate is \"t72 t47 t50\". Since this is a CFG, each token in the string is a terminal symbol, so I need to check if I can derive this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the production for S is NT6 NT34. So the first step is to split the string into parts that match these two non-terminals.\n\nThe string is three tokens: t72, t47, t50. Since S produces NT6 and NT34, I'll need to see if \"t72\" is from NT6 and \"t47\" is from NT34. Let me check the productions for NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (but I don't see t72 here)\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (again)\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- Wait, I'm seeing multiple entries. The fourth production for NT6 is actually the same as the second. Maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the first rule under NT6 is NT27 NT19. Then it has another option: NT33 NT19. Third option: NT21 NT25. Fourth: same as the second. Fifth: NT17 NT7. Sixth: NT21 NT25 again. Seventh: NT27 NT19.\n\nHmm. So, none of these directly produce t72. But looking further, under NT27, it has a production that includes NT7 and NT7, which eventually produce t66, but that's inconsistent here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider how these non-terminals can lead to terminals. Let me see NT7's rules. NT7 has two productions: NT7 -> NT77, which is a terminal, and NT77. Oh, wait, no, looking back, under NT7, it says NT7 -> 't66' and NT7 -> 't73'. Oh, so NT7 can produce either t66 or t73.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go back. The string is t72, t47, t50. Let's see if any non-terminals produce t72. Looking through NT6's and NT4's productions.\n\nWait, no. Let me check each non-terminal that has a production leading to t72.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT27 has a production NT27 -> NT7 NT7. Since NT7 can produce t66 or t73, then NT27 can produce something like t66 t66, t66 t73, or t73 t73. None of these are t72.\n\nLooking further, is any non-terminal producing t72 directly? Checking the rules, I don't see any rule that directly produces t72. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t72 can be produced by a chain of rules. Let me check if any non-terminal produces t72. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT27 has NT27 -> NT6 NT19. But earlier I saw that NT6 doesn't produce t72 directly. Wait, perhaps there's a longer chain.\n\nWait, let me check NT14. NT14 -> NT27 NT2. Then NT27, as above, produces t66 or t73. And NT2 -> NT0 NT20, which is 't66' or something else. This might get too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by seeing if the string can be split into two parts corresponding to NT6 and NT34. So the first part should be t72 and the second t47. Let's see what options NT6 and NT34 have.\n\nWait, earlier I thought NT6 doesn't produce t72 directly, but maybe through a chain.\n\nWait, let me see: NT27 can be t73, and if in NT27 it's part of some larger chain, maybe it can lead to t72. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the string is constructed in a way that requires more steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see what NT6 can produce. From the rules, all productions for NT6 end with NT33, NT21, etc., which ultimately produce t's. Looking at each production:\n\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7. Then NT17 -> t66 or t54. Hmm.\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25. NT21 has rules that include NT29, etc. Which could lead to t49 or t39.\n- Maybe it's impossible for NT6 to produce t72 because all its productions involve other non-terminals that don't directly go to t72.\n\nWait, let's check NT20. Wait, no, the S's production starts with NT6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire string as three symbols. Since the production starts with NT6 and NT34, maybe the string is a concatenation of two parts. But the string has three symbols, which would mean one part might produce two symbols, which is possible only if a non-terminal can produce two terminals in one step, but in Chomsky normal form, each production produces two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, in ChN, each rule is A \u2192 BC, where B and C can be terminals or non-terminals. So each production leads to two symbols. So the process starts at S, deriving two non-terminals, then each of those could derive two more, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the string length must be a power of 2 times the derivation steps. But our string has three symbols, which is not a power of two. Wait, no, ChN allows for trees that may not be perfectly balanced, but each production adds exactly two symbols. So for example, starting with S, which is two non-terminals. Then each of those could expand into two more, making four, and so on. The total number of symbols would be 2^k for some k. So 3 is not a power of two. That suggests that the string \"t72 t47 t50\" has a length of 3, which perhaps isn't possible. But wait, maybe I'm wrong because each production could introduce more symbols, including some being non-terminals that can themselves produce more.\n\nWait, no, each production always replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, which could be one or two non-terminals and\/or terminals. So the total number of symbols increases by the number of terminals produced at each step. But the number of non-terminals can vary. However, in the end, the entire string must consist of terminals. Each step replaces non-terminals with two symbols, so the length increases by the number of terminals produced minus one each time. Hmm, maybe my initial thought is incorrect. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me try to see if \"t72 t47 t50\" can be generated by following the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, the string has three terminals. Let's see if any of the productions in the grammar could directly produce three terminals in a single step. No, because each rule produces exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo the derivation tree must have a certain structure that ends with three terminals. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work backwards. Starting from the string, see which rules in the grammar could produce it.\n\nWait, but the string is three terminals. It's possible only if the bottom of the parse tree has exactly three terminals. But ChN rules produce two symbols at each step, so the overall number should allow for it. Actually, since each step can introduce more non-terminals, the count of terminals can vary. For example, it's possible to have the root S produce NT6 and NT34 (each of which can be terminals or non-terminals). If both NT6 and NT34 produce a terminal each, you get two symbols. If one of them is a non-terminal that then produces two terminals, then you'd have three symbols overall.\n\nSo the string \"t72 t47 t50\" has three tokens, so maybe the initial step involves one non-terminal being a terminal (like t72) and the other being a non-terminal that expands into two terminals (t47 and t50). Let's explore that possibility.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Suppose NT6 produces t72, and NT34 produces t47 and t50"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-50","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t68 t53 t23 t41`, and the grammar consists of a bunch of production rules. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the given grammar follows CNF since all the left-hand sides are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t68 t53 t23 t41`. This is a sequence of four tokens, each starting with 't' followed by a number. Looking at the grammar, I notice that some of these tokens are terminals (like 't77', 't47', etc.), but others might be part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a recursive descent parser or perhaps work through the string from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with S, the production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first step is to see if the string starts with NT6, and then the next symbol is NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't68'. Let me check what NT6 can produce. Looking through the grammar rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 has several productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 \u2192 wait, that's the same as the first one. Also, another rule: NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19, but that's a left recursion, which isn't helpful here. Wait, no, actually that's not the case. Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT6 is first defined as NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and then another rule says NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, and another says NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 again. Also, there's NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, and another NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at each production for NT6:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n4. Also, there's NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, which is the same as the first one. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or duplicate. So, we have three unique productions for NT6.\n\nNow, the first token in the string is 't68'. So, I need to see if 't68' can be matched by any terminal in the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't29', but that's not 't68'. NT19 is another rule: NT19 \u2192 't47', also not matching. Let me check other terminals:\n\nLooking further down, I see NT6 \u2192 't20' and also NT19 \u2192 't23' (wait, no, NT19 \u2192 't23' is not present. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT19 has several productions:\n\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, NT19 \u2192 't47', and also NT19 \u2192 't23'? Wait, no. Looking at the details:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nNT19 -> 't47'\nNT19 -> 't23' (is that correct?) Let me check: yes, under NT19, there are two productions: one is NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, another is NT19 \u2192 't47'. Hmm, but also, is there another rule for NT19?\n\nWait, looking back: The user provided the grammar as:\n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\n\nand\n\nNT19 -> 't47'.\n\nSo, NT19 can either produce 't47' or something else (but nothing else in this case). But in the initial structure, looking for 't68' which is not covered by NT19's immediate productions.\n\nWait, no. 't68' would have to be produced by a terminal, right? So, perhaps the string's tokens are derived from non-terminals and terminals. So, 't68' is a terminal, so it must come directly from a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce 't68'. I'll go through the list of non-terminals and see where they have 't68' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20' (is that correct? Yes, under NT6's production: NT6 -> 't20'. Similarly, NT19 \u2192 't47', and other terminals.\n\nWait, looking further:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't53'\n\nWait, but our string starts with 't68'. So, none of the immediate terminals match 't68'. Maybe I need to see if 't68' can be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, are any of the non-terminals producing 't68'? Let me check each terminal rule:\n\n- Looking through, I see:\n\nNT1: 't61'\n\nNT2: 't28'\n\nNT3: 't29'\n\nNT4: 't29' and 't36'\n\nNT5: Not listed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me go through each rule to spot any that produce 't68'.\n\nLooking at NT27: 't72', 't66', 't67', 't73' come from NT7? Wait, NT7: NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'. Also, NT27 \u2192 't72' and 't73'. Wait, that's under NT27.\n\nWait, but the string's first token is 't68', which is not directly present as a terminal. So perhaps 't68' is produced by a longer chain of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The string is a sequence of terminals. So, each token in the string must be a terminal or a result of substituting a non-terminal's production chain down to a terminal.\n\nSo, for 't68', I need to find a non-terminal production chain that ends in 't68'. Let me see if any of the non-terminals immediately derive 't68'.\n\nLooking at the initial list, perhaps I missed a production for a non-terminal that produces 't68'. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar as provided includes:\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' and 't73'\nWait, no 't68' in there yet.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't53' and also NT22 \u2192 't77' or other things. And looking elsewhere:\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm missing it. Let me scan each ND rule for terminals:\n\n- NT6: 't20'\n- NT7: 't66', 't73'\n- NT15: 't65'\n- NT17: 't66', 't72'\n- NT18: 't22', 't66'\n- NT22: 't53', 't77'\n- NT24: 't14'\n- NT25: 't49', 't57'\n- NT27: 't72', 't73'\n- NT31: 't31's leading to various t's\n- NT33: 't55'\n- ... and others.\n\nWait, where is 't68'? Hmm. I don't see it. So perhaps 't68' cannot be generated by the grammar, which would mean the string 't68 t53 t23 t41' can't be generated, hence the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe 't68' is produced by some non-terminal. Wait, looking back, in the grammar rules for NT12: it's broken down into 't68', as in NT12-> 't68'? Let's check NT12's productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT12 -> NT14 NT34\n- NT12 -> NT15 NT4\n- NT12 -> NT14 NT0\n- Also, NT12 \u2192 't68' (is that correct?

{"custom_id":"request-49","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t35 t66 t23 t3` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Chomsky normal form means each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with one terminal on the right. So each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It has a bunch of non-terminals that eventually expand into terminals, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers or some other symbols. For example, I see that NT1, NT2, etc., all have productions that end up with terminal strings like 't66', 't3', etc.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t35 t66 t23 t3`. It's a sequence of four tokens, so I need to see if the grammar can derive this sequence in order.\n\nLet me start by breaking down each token and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\n1. t35: Looking through the grammar, I see that NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0, and NT22 has a production to t10 or other things, but I don't see a direct production for t35. Wait, looking further, there's NT33 and others. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I should look for any rule that directly produces t35. Looking through the grammar, I see NT31 -> NT31 NT17, NT33 -> NT31 NT17, etc., but nothing directly gives t35. Maybe I need to look for where t35 is defined. Wait, the grammar doesn't have a production for NT35, except in the rules. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nWait, the NT31 production has some where NT31 can go to NT22 NT0. So if NT22 can produce t10, and NT0 is t66, but that's not t35. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a production that reaches t35. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to look for a production that can reach t35.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their possible expansions to terminals to see if any can produce t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT31 can go to NT31 NT17, NT33 NT17, etc. So maybe through some chain, it ends up at t35. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for NT that can produce t35. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT35. So perhaps I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t35 through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I can try the first production: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string t35 t66 t23 t3 could come from S, which produces NT6 (something) and NT34 (something else). The string has four tokens, so S must expand into four non-terminals, but S only produces two. Wait, that doesn't add up. Because S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which would produce two parts, but the string is four tokens. So perhaps each of those non-terminals can further split into two parts. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string as a sequence of four terminals. So the string has four tokens: t35, t66, t23, t3.\n\nSince the start symbol is S, which produces two parts: NT6 and NT34. So the string would need to be a combination of the expansions of these two non-terminals, each expanding into two parts, making four in total. Wait, that might be possible. Let's try to map it.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first token t35 would come from NT6, and the other tokens would come from NT34. Let's see how that works.\n\nFirst, NT6's productions. Looking through NT6's rules, there are several:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 also has some other rules, but let's see which ones end up in terminals. Wait, I'm supposed to follow each production to find the terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for which non-terminals can produce t35.\n\nWait, but from the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly goes to t35. Hmm, maybe t35 comes from a chain of productions. Let's see if any NT can produce t35.\n\nLooking through all NT productions:\n\nNT31 has paths to NT22 and NT0. NT22's productions include t10 and other NTs. So for t35, perhaps it's via NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0, and NT22 can produce t10 and NT0 which is t66. So that would give t10 t66, which is t10 t66, but that's not t35.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for any NT that has a production that includes t35. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t35 is produced by some NT that I'm not seeing. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to map the entire string step by step.\n\nLet's assume the string is generated by S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first terminal, t35, must come from NT6, and the next three must come from NT34. But wait, NT6 and NT34 each produce two terminals, so the total would be four. Let's see.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 (gives t1, t2) and NT34 (gives t3, t4). So the string would be t1 t2 t3 t4.\n\nIn our case, the string is t35 t66 t23 t3. So let's try to see:\n\nIs there a way for NT6 to produce t35 and a part leading to t66, t23, t3?\n\nWait, wait. Let's see NT6's productions again:\n\nNT6 can go to NT27 NT19. Let's take the first option:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19.\n\nSo now, NT27 can produce certain things. Looking at the rule, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT7 NT7. Wait, no, NT27 has:\n\nLooking back, the rules include:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nAnd NT7 has:\n\nNT7 -> 't66' or NT7 -> 't73'.\n\nWait, so from NT27, each NT7 in its production can go to 't66' or 't73'. So for example, NT27 can expand to 't66' 't66' if both go to 't66'. Or 't66 t73', etc. But I'm not sure how that connects to t35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see which non-terminals can reach t35.\n\nLooking through all the productions, none directly produce t35. So perhaps the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is correct, but we need to see if NT6 and NT34 can produce the necessary tokens.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so two parts. So the string would need to be a combination of the expansions of NT6 and NT34, each contributing two tokens.\n\nSo the string is t35 t66 t23 t3. So maybe NT6 produces t35 t66, and NT34 produces t23 t3? But let's see.\n\nLooking at NT6's possible paths. Let's say NT6 can expand to t35 t66 via a chain.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nHmm, maybe through NT21 NT25?

{"custom_id":"request-69","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string `t66 t73 t14 t37 t3` is generated by the given grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, from S, we need to derive a string that starts with NT6 followed by NT34. \n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t66. Now, the NT6 symbol in the grammar has productions. Let me check what options NT6 has. From the grammar, NT6 can produce two options: NT27 NT19 and NT33 NT19. \n\nSince the first token is t66, I need to see which of NT6's productions can derive to t66. Looking at the productions for NT6, I don't see any direct t66. Wait, maybe I need to look deeper into the productions. There's also NT27 and NT33 that might lead to t66. \n\nLooking at NT27, it has a production NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two options: t66 or t73. So, NT27 can be t66 or t73, each from the NT7 productions. Similarly, NT33 can be NT31 NT17, and NT31 can derive to t43 or other things. Wait, maybe I should break it down step by step.\n\nLet's try the first option: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. The first token is t66, which could come from NT6 or NT34. So perhaps S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and then NT6 produces something that results in t66. \n\nLooking at NT6's productions, the first option is NT27 NT19. NT27 can go to t66 (via NT7 \u2192 t66). So, if NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, then NT27 can produce t66, which matches the first token. \n\nNext, NT34 from S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the next part after t66 should be whatever NT34 produces. Looking at NT34's productions: NT34 \u2192 NT33 NT15. Wait, actually, the initial string is t66 t73 t14 t37 t3. The second token is t73, so maybe I need to see if NT34 can produce that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Since the first token is t66, which comes from NT6, let's take the first production of NT6, which is NT27 NT19. So, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 becomes NT27 NT19 NT34. Now, the first symbol is t66, so NT27 must produce a string starting with t66. \n\nNT27's production is NT7 NT7. So, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7. Now, NT7 can be t66 or t73. So, for the string to have t66 as the first token, NT7 must produce t66. Thus, the first step is NT27 \u2192 t66. \n\nSo, now we have t66 (from NT27) and then we need to derive the rest of the string from the remaining symbols: NT19 NT34. The next token is t73. But after getting t66, we have to see if NT19 can produce something that starts with t73. \n\nLooking at NT19's productions: it can produce t47 or other things? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see NT19 \u2192 't47' directly. So, NT19 can produce t47. But in the string, after t66 comes t73, so that doesn't match. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go back. The initial S is NT6 NT34. NT6 can produce NT27 NT19, which would give us t66 (from NT27) and then NT19. But the next token is t73, not t47. So, perhaps this is the wrong path. Maybe I should consider the other production for NT6, which is NT33 NT19. \n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 \u2192 NT33 NT19 NT34. NT33 can produce NT31 NT17. Let's see: NT31 can then produce t43 or other things. But I'm not sure. Let's see: if NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17, and NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0, and so on. It's getting a bit complicated. \n\nWait, maybe I should try a different approach. Let me look at the string and see if each token can be derived from the grammar. The string is: t66, t73, t14, t37, t3.\n\nStarting with t66, which must come from NT6. The possible productions for NT6 are NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19. \n\nIf NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, then NT27 must produce t66 via NT7. So, NT27 \u2192 t66. Then NT19 must produce the next symbol in the string, which is t73. But NT19's production is either 't47' or, looking back at the grammar, I think I might have missed something. Wait, let me check again. \n\nLooking at the grammar, in the NT19 section: NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21 or NT24 NT14. Wait, no, let me find it. Oh, here it is: NT19 \u2192 't47' directly. So, NT19 can only produce t47 or perhaps other things? Wait, looking again, I see two lines for NT19: \n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\nNT19 -> NT24 NT14\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Looking at the grammar, under NT19, the production is only NT24 NT21 and NT31? Or maybe I'm misreading. Let me scan the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar is:\n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\nNT19 -> NT24 NT14\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, I see:\n\nNT19 is derived from NT24 NT21 and NT24 NT14. So, NT19 can produce two non-terminals. Then, looking further down, NT24 can produce NT14, and NT21 can produce NT13 or others.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me make a list of each NT along with their productions to avoid confusion.\n\nLet me parse the grammar step by step.\n\nFirst, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 | NT33 NT19.\n\nSo, NT6 can go to NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19.\n\nIn the string, after t66, the next token is t73. So, the second symbol is t73.\n\nIf the first symbol is t66 from NT6 via NT27 \u2192 t66, then the next symbol should come from NT19.\n\nBut looking at NT19's productions, it only goes to NT24 NT21 or NT24 NT14. So, after NT19, the next symbol is produced by NT24 or NT21?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider that each production of NT19 goes to non-terminals, which then produce the terminals. So, perhaps I need to trace the derivation step by step.\n\nLet me try the first approach again:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (since this is one of the options).\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 (its production).\n4. Each NT7 can produce t66 or t73.\n\nSo, if NT27 \u2192 t66, then the first token is t66.\n\nThen, the remaining symbols after S's production are NT19 NT34.\n\nNow, NT19's production is NT24 NT21 (or perhaps another option) and so on.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me start from the string and see if it can be split into symbols that match the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: [t66][t73][t14][t37][t3].\n\nEach symbol must be the result of a derivation from the non-terminals.\n\nLet me think about each symbol:\n\n1. t66: comes from NT6 (as we determined) via NT27 \u2192 t66.\n2. t73: comes from where?

{"custom_id":"request-71","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t68 t53 t14 t81 t50\". Hmm, context-free grammars can sometimes be tricky, but let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules: each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow that because all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's good; it's already in CNF.\n\nNow, the string in question is a sequence of terminals. So each word in the string must correspond to the RHS of some production rule. The idea is to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is to split the entire string into two parts: the first half derived from NT6 and the second from NT34. But wait, N and T are probably non-terminals, so we might have to split the string into components that match each non-terminal's RHS.\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is only a single non-terminal on the LHS, so to derive a string, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with a pair of non-terminals or a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, any non-terminal must expand into such elements.\n\nSo, starting from S, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Therefore, the string must be generated by first splitting into parts corresponding to NT6 and NT34. Since NT6 and NT34 are the next non-terminals in the chain, each would eventually generate a sequence that starts the string.\n\nLooking at the string \"t68 t53 t14 t81 t50\", it's five words long. The LHS of the grammar for S has two symbols, so perhaps the string is a result of expanding S into two parts, each handled by NT6 and NT34. Each of those would then further expand into smaller sequences.\n\nLet's try to parse the string backward. Let's see if the last few elements could come from a production.\n\nLooking at the RHS, the starting non-terminals N can be any of NT14, NT20, NT12, NT19, NT22, NT31, NT11, NT10, NT33, NT27, etc. Each of these non-terminals has their own productions.\n\nLet me check if the last few words can come from a particular non-terminal. The last word is t50. Looking at the productions, NT34 can produce 't3' or it can split into two non-terminals. Similarly, NT33 produces 't55' or splits. Wait, but t50 isn't a terminal in any production. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminal strings are things like 't66', 't20', etc. I notice some terminals like 't47', 't65', etc. Let's see if 't50' is a terminal in any production.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see 't50' as a terminal. Wait, let's check:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't3' or splits.\n\n- NT33 \u2192 't55' or splits.\n\n- NT31 can go to 't43' or splits.\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' or splits.\n\n- NT22 can go to 't77' or splits.\n\n- NT20 can go to 't45' or splits.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each production's terminal.\n\nLooking at NT34's production: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So when considering NT34, its productions include 't3', 't47', 't65', etc. Let me see if 't50' is a terminal in any production.\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I don't see any terminal 't50'. That might be a problem because the string has 't50' as the last element. So perhaps the string ends here, but 't50' is not a terminal in any of the productions. That would mean the grammar cannot produce 't50' at the end, so the string can't be generated by this grammar. But wait, maybe I'm missing it.\n\nLet me double-check. Looking at the productions:\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't76' wait, no, 't77' and 't73'\n\nWait, looking at NT6's productions, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20', 't27', etc.\n\nWait, but none of them produce 't50'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's part of a split. For example, NT31 can produce 't43' or split into more non-terminals. So maybe during expansion, one of the splits leads to 't50'?\n\nBut if the string ends with 't50', then that would mean that the derivation for that part must have 't50' as a terminal, but according to the productions, it's not present. So unless there's a typo and 't50' is supposed to be another terminal, perhaps the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but another possibility: perhaps 't50' is from a split that's supposed to generate t50 indirectly. Let me think. For example, a non-terminal X that produces Y and Z, where Y or Z is a non-terminal that leads to t50, but I need to trace all the way.\n\nWait, but according to the provided productions, none of the non-terminals end in 't50' except possibly NT34. Let me see NT34's productions.\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3' | NT31 NT17\n\nWait, NT34 can split into NT31 and NT17. Then, let's look at NT31's productions. NT31 can be 't43' or split into NT22 and NT0, or other rules.\n\nWait, in the list, NT31 has multiple productions, including:\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\nNT31 \u2192 NT2 \u2192 ? Wait, no, let me find.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT31:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0 (duplicate line?)\n\nWait, in the list:\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nLooking through all NT31 productions:\n\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT17\n\n- NT31 -> NT22 NT0\n\n- NT31 -> NT27 NT7\n\n- NT31 -> NT27 NT28\n\n- NT31 -> NT22 NT0\n\nWait, perhaps the last one is a typo, but regardless, let's focus on the relevant ones.\n\nSo, for example, if NT31 is split into NT22 and NT0, then NT22 might produce more, and NT0 is 't66'.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing t50 being generated. Maybe in a more complicated expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me take a different approach.\n\nLet me try to parse the string backward to see if each terminal can be a result of a production.\n\nStarting with the last word: 't50'. Is there any non-terminal that can generate 't50' as a terminal? From the productions, I can't see any NT whose only terminal is 't50'. So perhaps the grammar can't generate 't50' at all, making the string invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe 't50' is part of a larger production. For example, if a non-terminal X has a production that includes 't50' as an intermediate.\n\nLooking for NT productions that have 't50' in their RHS. Let me go through all the productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't20'; no.\n\n- NT14 -> 't72'; no.\n\n- NT20 -> 't45'; no.\n\n- NT12 -> 't68'? Wait, 't68' is a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for non-terminals:\n\nLooking through all production rules, I can't find any production that directly generates 't50'. So 't50' can only appear if it's generated by a split, but I don't see any such rule.\n\nTherefore, 't50' cannot appear as a terminal in the string produced by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-91","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this question where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar provided is quite extensive with many productions, and the string to evaluate is \"t29 t41 t54 t84 t23 t50\". \n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has specific rules. Each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, all productions are from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with something derived from NT6 and NT34. Let me check the terminal values: NT6 becomes 't20' and NT34 is 't3'. So the first two tokens should be 't20' and 't3'. But the string starts with 't29', which is different. That seems off. Wait, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the productions: NT6 can be 't27' or 't20'. Oh, so when I have NT6, sometimes it's 't27' and other times 't20'. But in the given string, the first token is 't29'. Let me check if any production results in 't29'. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT21 \u2192 't29' (twice) and NT11 \u2192 't54' (which doesn't help here). Hmm, wait, 't29' comes from NT4 and NT21. \n\nSo, if the string starts with 't29', that must come from either NT4 or NT21. Let's check the productions for NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT29 or 't41'. Wait, the grammar shows NT4 \u2192 't36' and other productions? Let me check the given grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT4 -> 't29' and another production: NT4 -> 't36'. Then, it also has NT4 -> 't39' and another rule: NT4 -> 't53'. Wait, no, more specifically, looking closer, the grammar shows:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nNT25 \u2192 't49' and 't57'\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\nNT10 \u2192 't50'\nNT27 \u2192 't72'\nNT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\nAnd others, but for NT4, it's directly mapped to 't29', 't36', 't39', etc. Wait, no, I'm confusing. Let me parse the given grammar again.\n\nThe grammar's rules for NT4 are:\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nNT4 \u2192 't36'\nNT4 \u2192 't39'\nWait, actually, in the list, I see:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nNT25 \u2192 't49' and 't57'\nNT21 \u2192 't29' (twice)\nNT4 \u2192 't36'?\nWait, let me go through each rule carefully.\n\nLooking at the rules, for NT4, it's written as:\nNT4 -> 't29'\nWait, is that the only rule for NT4? Or are there more?\n\nLooking again, the rule is listed as NT4 -> 't29' and other productions? Let me list all NT4 rules:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't27' and 't20' (but this is for NT6)\nWait, no. Let me find NT4. Actually, looking through the rules:\n\nI see:\nNT4 -> 't29'\nNT25 -> 't49' and 't57'\nNT24 -> 't14'\nNT10 -> 't50'\nNT27 -> 't72'\nNT7 -> 't66' and 't73'\nNT7 appears multiple times\nNT6 -> 't27' and 't20'\n\nWait, no, for NT4: Looking at the provided grammar, I see several entries. Let me list all NT4 rules:\n\nLooking through, I see NT4 -> 't29' is one. Wait, is that all? Because the provided grammar has:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nand then NT6's rules, NT20, etc. Wait, perhaps I need to recount.\n\nWait, the provided grammar has the following rules for NT4:\nNT4 \u2192 't29' (1)\nWait, is there another production for NT4? I'm scanning through the provided rules:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nI see NT1's production, NT2, etc. Let me find NT4 rules:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nNT25 \u2192 't49' and 't57'\nHTHink: So, based on that, NT4 has multiple rules but only NT4 \u2192 't29' is in the provided list. Wait, no, looking through, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't29' is one rule.\nWait, maybe I missed any others. Let me recheck:\n\nLooking again, the user provided the grammar as a list of rules, each line is A -> ... So searching for NT4, I find:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't49'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo, NT4 only maps to 't29' and is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Wait, no. Because in Chomsky normal form, non-terminals should expand to other non-terminals or terminals. If NT4 is a non-terminal, it must have productions that lead to other symbols. So if NT4 \u2192 't29' directly, that would make it a terminal production, which is allowed in CNF if a non-terminal can produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the user's grammar, S starts with NT6 and NT34. So S is the start symbol, presumably.\n\nSo the string is \"t29 t41 t54 t84 t23 t50\". Let's parse this string as a sequence of terminals. So the first token is 't29', which must come from a production, say NT4.\n\nBut in the grammar, the only rule for NT4 is NT4 \u2192 't29'. So that seems possible. But let's verify.\n\nIf the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo S becomes NT6 NT34.\n\nNow, NT6 can be expanded. Let's see what NT6 produces. Looking through, I see NT6 has multiple rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't27' (from NT6 -> 't27 NT19')\nWait, no: From the provided rules, for NT6:\n\nLooking again:\nNT6 -> 't27' (twice)\nNT6 -> 't20'\nNT6 -> 't27' (from NT6 -> 't27 NT19')\nWait, no. Wait, the provided rules for NT6:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT21 appears, and NT25.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the rules again for NT6:\n\nIn the provided list:\n\n- NT6 -> 't27' (appears twice, perhaps two productions)\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo NT6 can produce either 't27', 't20', or 't27' again via another production.\n\nSo if NT6 is 't20', that would make sense because the second token in the string is 't41'.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe string is 't29', 't41', 't54', 't84', 't23', 't50'.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSuppose NT6 is 't20' (from NT6 \u2192 't20'), but then the first token is 't29', not 't20'. So that's a problem. So NT6 cannot be 't20' in this case because the string starts with 't29'.\n\nAlternatively, if NT6 is producing a sequence that results in 't29', perhaps as part of a larger expansion.\n\nWait, since S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and both NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals, each must be expanded into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSimilarly, the entire string is the combination of these expansions.\n\nSo the string can be seen as the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nTherefore, the string \"t29 t41 t54 t84 t23 t50\" should be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the string `t38 t0 t54 t40 t47 t50` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it simplifies parsing; each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, it's S. So the derivation begins with S. The production for S is NT6 NT34. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34. That means in the parse tree, S has two children: NT6 and NT34. \n\nNow, the string we're checking is `t38 t0 t54 t40 t47 t50`. Since each production splits into two, the string should have an even number of symbols if all are terminals. Wait, but here the string is of length 6, which is even, so that's good. Each non-terminal in the grammar will be replaced by two non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by mapping each terminal symbol in the string to a non-terminal production. For example, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal that results from a specific production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT38 \u2192 maybe 't38'?\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT38: I don't see a production for NT38. Hmm, that's not possible. Wait, but in the string, the first token is t38. So in the grammar, where does t38 come from? Let me check the rules.\n\nWait, the list of rules is given as NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, etc. Let me search through all the productions to see which NTs produce t38, t0, etc.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t14\n- NT22 \u2192 t72, t38, t10, etc. Wait, let me check each NT.\n\nLet's list all the NTs and their productions:\n\n1.

Let me go through each terminal in the string and see where they come from.\n\nFirst, 't38'. Looking at the rules, does any NT directly produce t38? Let's check the rules for NT22: NT22 has productions like \u2192 NT6 NT19, \u2192 NT4 NT15, \u2192 t72, \u2192 t38, \u2192 t10.\n\nSo NT22 can produce t38. So if we have t38, that's from NT22.\n\nNext, 't0'. Looking into rules for NT0 \u2192 't66'. So t0 comes from NT0. So t0 is NT0 \u2192 't66'. So to get 't0', the non-terminal must be NT0.\n\nThen, 't54'. Wait, in the rules, does any NT produce t54? Let me check. I think NT21 \u2192 t37, NT15 \u2192 t65, NT19 \u2192 t67, NT24 \u2192 t14, NT27 \u2192 t73, etc. Hmm, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t54. Wait, perhaps it's via another step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's try to build the parse tree for the string t38 t0 t54 t40 t47 t50.\n\nSince each non-terminal expands into two parts, the string has 6 symbols, so the derivation should have 3 splits. Let me try to see how the symbols come from NTs.\n\nThe string is: t38, t0, t54, t40, t47, t50.\n\nSo let me try to see which NTs can produce these.\n\nt38 comes from NT22, as we saw.\n\nt0 comes from NT0.\n\nt54: Hmm, perhaps NT15 \u2192 t65, NT17 \u2192 t66, NT22 \u2192 t10, or other? Wait, maybe t54 is from NT27?\n\nLooking at rules, NT27 \u2192 't72' (from NT7 \u2192 t66), but maybe via a chain.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a path that leads to these symbols. Maybe it's easier to work backwards, trying to find the productions that lead to these terminals.\n\nLet me start from the last symbol, t50.\n\nt50 comes from which NT? Looking through the rules:\n\nCheck NT34: It has a production NT34 \u2192 t3, t50.\n\nSo NT34 can produce t50 via the production NT34 \u2192 t50.\n\nSo the last symbol t50 comes from NT34 \u2192 t50.\n\nThen, moving back, the previous symbols must combine into NT34.\n\nSo, before t50, we have t47, t50. So looking at the production NT25 \u2192 't49' and 't57', but that's not matching. Alternatively, looking for NT34 \u2192 't50' directly. Wait, perhaps NT34 is part of a larger NT's production.\n\nWait, the production for NT34 is NT34 \u2192 t3, t50.\n\nSo in the string, t54 comes before t40. Let me check if t54 comes from NT25.\n\nLooking at NT25: its productions are NT25 \u2192 't55' and others. Hmm, maybe I'm getting lost. Perhaps it's better to see which NTs can produce the necessary terminals.\n\nLet me approach this by writing the string and trying to map each token to a possible NT production.\n\nThe string is t38, t0, t54, t40, t47, t50.\n\nNow, the first symbol is t38, which comes from NT22 \u2192 t38.\n\nSo perhaps the first two symbols come from a production starting with NT22.\n\nBut wait, each NT's production splits into two. So maybe the first two symbols are the result of an NT's production.\n\nLet me try to see which NTs can split into t38 and something else.\n\nIf the first production is NT22 \u2192 t38 and ... Well, the first symbol is t38, so perhaps NT22 is the starting point.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nThen, in the first step, S splits into NT6 and NT34. So the first symbol is from NT6, and the second from NT34. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, the order in the string is t38, t0, etc. So perhaps the first step is to see where t38 and t0 could come from.\n\nWait, no, the order matters. So the first token in the string is t38. So t38 is the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the start S \u2192 NT6 NT34.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which has a few key characteristics: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production either gives two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, every derivation starts with NT6 and NT34, and they can't be broken down further unless those non-terminals can be replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI should break down the string into its components and see if they can be generated by the grammar. Let's split the string into individual tokens based on spaces:\n\n1. t72\n2. t45\n3. t67\n4. t3\n5. t53\n6. t47\n7. t41\n\nWait, but the grammar might require certain sequences, so I should see if each token is either a terminal or can be derived through a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice each non-terminal eventually resolves to a terminal. So, for each non-terminal, there's a chain of productions that lead to the terminal. For example, NT6 can produce 't20' directly, but in this case, the string has 't72', so maybe the non-terminal that produces 't72' is part of the chain.\n\nWait, let me check the productions given. Let me go through the list and note which NTs produce which terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73' (I think)\nWait no, let me check again. The productions for NT7: Looking at the list, I see `NT7 -> 't66'` and `NT7 -> 't73'`. Hmm, that's interesting. So NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'.\n\nBut in our string, we have t72, which isn't directly listed. So maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT17: NT17 \u2192 NT14 NT31 and NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4, etc. Also, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map all the non-terminals to their possible terminals, step by step, starting from the leaves.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the string and see if each token is reachable through some non-terminals that expand down to it.\n\nThe string is t72, t45, t67, t3, t53, t47, t41.\n\nFirst, t72: Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce t72?\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't see an immediate NT that produces 't72' directly. Wait, let me check the list again.\n\nWait, for example, NT77 is produced by NT7 NT7? Or wait, maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nWait, let me list the direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n- NT24 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49' or 't57'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7' and then further.\n- NT31 \u2192 't31' if it gets to the end, but more likely into terminals.\n- NT10 \u2192 't12' or 't40'\n- NT11 \u2192 't54'\n- NT19 \u2192 't23' and 't47'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29' or 't39'\n- NT22 \u2192 't38' and 't10'\n- NT34 \u2192 't3' or 't50'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n- NT34 \u2192 't50'\n- NT6 \u2192 't52'\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let's see:\n\nt72 is in the string. So, looking for a non-terminal that can produce 't72'. From the productions, I see NT14 -> 't72'. So, somewhere in the derivation, NT14 must have to be expanded to 't72'.\n\nSimilarly, t45 is next. Which non-terminals produce 't45'? Looking at NT20 \u2192 't45', so we need to derive 't45' as one token, so somewhere NT20 will expand to 't45'.\n\nWait, but let me check the productions again. Yes, NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0. Hmm. So, how does NT20 become 't45'? Because NT20 produces NT15 NT0. So, let's see: NT15 produces 't65' and NT0 produces 't66'. So, combining those, 't65 t66', which isn't matching 't45'. Hmm, that's a problem. So, that suggests that NT20 doesn't produce 't45'; instead, 't45' is a terminal, so perhaps it's one of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, the productions are in a list, so looking again:\n\nI think I misassigned which NT produces which terminal. Let me scan the list again carefully.\n\nHere's the list of productions:\n\nLooking for which non-terminals map directly to terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n- NT24 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49' or 't57'\n- NT27 \u2192 't7' and so on, eventually leading to 't66' or 't73'\n- NT31 \u2192 't31' and so on, leads to 't0', 't66', etc.\n- NT10 \u2192 't12' or 't40'\n- NT11 \u2192 't54'\n- NT19 \u2192 't23' or 't47'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29' or 't39'\n- NT22 \u2192 't25' or 't10'\n- NT34 \u2192 't3' or 't50'\n- NT6 \u2192 't52'\n- NT2 \u2192 't37'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37' or 't29'\n- NT4 \u2192 't39' or 't57'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49' or 't57'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37' or 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't52' or 't80'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' or 't37'\n- NT21 \u2192 't81' or 't29'\n\nWait, perhaps I need to correct my earlier statements. Let's go through each non-terminal and see exactly what it produces.\n\nLet me list all the NTs and their possible terminals:\n\n- NT6: produces t20, or breaks down into NT27 and NT19. Let's see what those produce.\nLooking up NT27: produces NT7 and NT7, which can lead to t66 or t73. So NT27 \u2192 t72 through t73? Wait, wait no, NT27 is a two-step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a mapping of all NTs to their terminals, step by step, to see what each one can produce.\n\nStarting with NT14:\n\nNT14 \u2192 't72' (direct terminal). So, if I have NT14, it can produce 't72'.\n\nNT20 \u2192 't45' (direct terminal). So, if I have NT20, it can produce 't45'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, each production is a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, that can't be, because in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So, in that case, NT20 is derived from NT15 and NT0.

{"custom_id":"request-116","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to figure out if the string `t77 t66 t66 t66 t54 t23 t3` is generated by it. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, looking at the grammar, it's a set of productions where each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals. The starting symbol is S, which immediately expands into NT6 and NT34. So the string starts with these two parts, and each of them will need to derive the respective parts of the string.\n\nThe string I'm given is `t77 t66 t66 t66 t54 t23 t3`. It seems like it's a series of terminals, so each of these must come from the terminals in the grammar. Let me look through the productions to see which non-terminals expand into these.\n\nStarting with NT6 -> NT27 NT19. Then NT27 seems to expand into NT7 and NT7. Wait, but the string starts with t77. Looking at NT7 and NT19 productions, I see NT7 can be 't72' or 't73'. So t77 isn't directly matched. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT19; in the grammar, NT19 -> 't47' and 't23'. Oh, right, t23 is a terminal. So might t23 come from NT19?\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is t77. NT6's production has NT27 and NT19. If NT27 is 't77', that would fit. Because earlier, I saw that NT27 -> 't66'? No, wait. Wait, no, let me check the productions again. From the grammar, NT27 -> NT7 NT7 or NT7 -> 't66', but wait, no: looking at the grammar, I see NT7 has productions to 't66' and 't73', and NT27's productions are: NT27 -> NT7 NT7, NT12, NT18, and others. Wait, let me correct that.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT27, it's written as NT27 -> NT7 NT7, so each symbol is a non-terminal, but in the string, the first symbol is 't77'. Wait, wait, actually, in the grammar, NT27 is written as NT27 -> NT7 NT7, but looking again, does any of these lead to 't77'?\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Because in the grammar, NT27's productions are all non-terminals except for NT27 itself. Wait, no, let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT27 is defined as NT7 NT7 and NT7 has 't66' and 't73'. So NT27 can produce 't66 t66', 't73 t73', or other combinations. But nowhere in the grammar does I see NT27 producing 't77'; that's only in NT19. So how does t77 come about?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the NTs. Let me check the initial productions:\n\nNT6 can produce NT27 and NT19. Wait, in the starting production, it's S -> NT6 NT34. So the first symbol would have to come from NT6. So if NT6 is NT27 and NT19, then the first two symbols would be... Hmm, actually, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary grammar, so each step in the derivation adds exactly two symbols. The fact that all productions are of the form A -> BC means every reduction in the parse tree will concatenate two symbols.\n\nBut this is the opposite of the usual approach, where the start symbol can produce multiple symbols, but here S starts with two non-terminals, each of which can themselves split into more symbols. Since it's CNF, each production is a binary split, so the total number of symbols in the derived string should be a power of two times the initial count, depending on the structure.\n\nWait, but our target string is seven symbols long, which is 2 + 3? Wait, no, the starting symbol S produces NT6 NT34, which is two non-terminals, so any valid derivation would result in a string of length equal to 2^k, but our string is length 7, which suggests that maybe the grammar can produce strings that aren't powers of two in length. Wait, that doesn't make sense, because in CNF, each production is two symbols, so the number of symbols should be a power of two.\n\nWait, 7 is not a power of two, which suggests that perhaps the string is not in the language. But I have to double-check because maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount: The string is `t77 t66 t66 t66 t54 t23 t3`, which has seven symbols. That can't be created by a CNF grammar because the number of symbols must be 2^k, like 2,4,8, etc. Wait, 7 is 2^3 + 1? No, that's not possible. So that's a problem because the grammar can only generate strings with a length that's a power of two. So that's a big hint that the string might not be in the language.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. For example, if the starting symbol S is a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals, and those can themselves produce more non-terminals, but eventually produce terminals. So each step in the parse tree increases the number of symbols by one (when combining two non-terminals into one terminal). Wait, no, that's not right. In CNF, it's always replacing one non-terminal with two, so the total number of symbols increases by one each time.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the right way. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that in CNF, every production is from a non-terminal to two other symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. The parse tree would start with S, which has two children. Each of those could themselves have two children, and so on until all leaves are terminals. So the total number of symbols is the number of leaves, which would be 2^k where k is the height of the tree.\n\nSo if the string has 7 symbols, which is not a power of two, that would indicate it's impossible to parse into a binary tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm counting the initial S incorrectly. S is just a non-terminal, so if the string is generated from S, the string length is 2^k. 7 is not a power of two, so that would immediately disqualify the string.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. 2^0 is 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8. So 7 symbols would be impossible in a binary grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nYes (I'm sorry, I can't respond to that.)"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string starts with t10. So I need a production that ends with t10. Looking for NT -> 't10' in the grammar. \n\nLooking at the rules, under NT22: \"NT22 -> 't77'\" and another rule \"NT22 -> 't10'\". Also, earlier, \"NT10 -> 't12'\", \"NT10 -> 't84'\", and some others. Wait, the rule NT10 -> 't10' occurs because in the grammar, under NT22, we have two rules: NT22 -> 't77' and NT22 -> 't10'. Wait, no:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT22, we have:\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17\nAnd earlier, two more rules:\nNT22 -> 't77' and another line says \"NT22 -> 't10'\". So NT22 has two terminal rules: 't77' and 't10'. Therefore, either of these can be used to produce t10 or t77.\n\nSo the first token is t10. So let's pick the production NT22 -> 't10'.\n\nSo, the initial step would be S -> NT6 NT34. Then NT6 and NT34 must be expanded.\n\nFirst, NT6: Looking at the grammar, under NT6 we have:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nSo NT6 can be broken down into these options. Since in our string, the next token after t10 is t0, but t0 comes from NT0 -> 't66'.\n\nWait, no, the string is t10, then t0, then t66, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me structure this: Each time a non-terminal is expanded, it should produce the given terminal at each position. So the first symbol t10 is from NT22, so NT22 must be the first to produce 't10'. Then S produces NT6 and NT34. So, after expanding NT22, we get t10, and then we need NT6 and NT34 to produce t0, t66, t73, t40, etc.\n\nWait, the string is t10 t0 t66 t73 t40 t54 t23 t50, which is 8 tokens. So the entire derivation must produce exactly these 8 tokens in order.

{"custom_id":"request-134","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is \"t36 t73 t36 t66 t66 t54 t47 t41\" and the grammar is a bunch of production rules. I'm just going to walk through my thought process step by step as I try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to understand what each non-terminal can produce. The grammar starts with S, which goes to NT6 NT34. So the first thing is that the string must start with the start symbol S, which expands into NT6 and NT34. Therefore, the string needs to start with what NT6 and NT34 translate into.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I'll need to see what each NT (non-terminal) expands into. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with NT6:\n- NT6 can go to NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT6 NT19. Hmm, it seems like NT6 has multiple possibilities. I'll have to track how it breaks down.\n\nNext, NT34:\n- NT34 goes directly to 't3', which is a terminal.\n\nSo the first part, starting with NT6, will eventually lead to 't3'. Let me think about how NT6 could generate something that starts with 't36' or 't73'. Wait, but 't36' is a terminal. Looking at the production rules, NT6 has to go through non-terminals. Let me check each production for NT6:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nHmm, so it's recursive. Let me check what NT27 and NT33 become.\n\nLooking at NT27:\n- NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nLooking at NT7:\n- NT7 can be 't66' or 't73'\n\nSo NT27 can produce sequences of t66 or t73. But in our string, the first token is t36, so that doesn't fit.\n\nLooking at NT33:\n- NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nWhat's NT31? NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 or NT31 NT17 or NT31 NT7. Wait, I need to check all the production rules.\n\nWait, looking back, I see NT31 has multiple production rules:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT22\n- NT31 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT28 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n- NT31 \u2192 NT18 NT1\n- NT31 \u2192 NT43 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT40 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT29 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT30 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT35 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT19 NT31\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should look at the terminal expansions to see how NT33 and NT27 can produce t36.\n\nWait, looking at NT33, its productions are:\n\n- NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n- NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17 (same as above)\n- NT33 \u2192 NT21 NT0\n\nSo NT33 can become NT21 NT0. NT21 can go to multiple things, including 't36'. Let's look at NT21.\n\nNT21 can produce:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT21 \u2192 NT29 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT43 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT40 NT1\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT17\n- NT21 \u2192 NT29 NT0\nWait, maybe I should check NT21's terminals. Looking through the rules, I see NT21 has some terminals:\n\nWait, in the production rules, for example, NT21 can produce 't36'. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production rules, NT21 appears in multiple productions:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (not a terminal)\n- NT21 \u2192 NT29 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT43 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT40 NT1\n- NT21 \u2192 NT37 NT0\n- NT21 \u2192 NT35 NT17\n- NT21 \u2192 NT29 NT0\n- Additionally, I see NT21 \u2192 't36' as one of the productions. Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see NT21 \u2192 't36'. Hmm. Maybe it's written in a different way.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT21 has a production NT21 \u2192 NT43 NT0, which leads to 't36' in NT43. Let me check NT43.\n\nNT43 can produce:\n\n- NT43 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n\nLooking at NT0, it expands to 't66' or 't0' and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking further down, I see NT19 expands to 't47', and NT4 \u2192 't29', NT27 \u2192 't73', etc. Maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT6 NT34, so the first part is NT6 and the second is 't3' since NT34 \u2192 't3'. So the string starts with t3. But wait, the given string starts with t36, which can't be directly from NT34, since that goes to 't3'.\n\nWait, no, the string is \"t36 t73 t36 t66 t66 t54 t47 t41\". So the first token is t36, which must come from NT6, since NT34 is 't3', but the string starts with t36. So that would mean NT6 must expand to something that starts with t36, but looking at the production rules for NT6, it's NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, or NT6 NT19. None of these directly produce t36, unless they expand deeper.\n\nBut wait, if NT6 can produce other non-terminals, perhaps it can eventually produce t36. Let me see. Let's consider each case.\n\nCase 1: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nNT7 can be 't66' or 't73'. So if both NT7s are 't73', then NT27 would produce 't73 t73'. Similarly, if both are 't66', 't66 t66'. So in this case, NT6 would produce 't73 t73' followed by NT19. What is NT19? Looking back, NT19 \u2192 't47'. So NT6 in this case would produce 't73 t73 t47'.\n\nBut the string starts with t36, so this case might not be relevant. Alternatively, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is \"t36 t73 t36 t66 t66 t54 t47 t41\". So, let's consider that the first part is t36, which must come from NT6. So let's see how NT6 can produce t36. Looking through the rules, NT6 doesn't have a production that directly gives t36. So perhaps this production isn't possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check NT6 again. The productions are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nSo unless one of these non-terminals can produce t36, it won't be possible. Let's look into NT33.\n\nNT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nLooking at NT31: its possible productions include NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17, which again seems recursive, but some of its productions lead to terminals. For example:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT43 NT0 \u2192 't36' followed by NT43 NT0.\n\nWait, no, looking back, I'm not sure. Let me check each rule where a NT31 is part of the production and see if it can lead to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-157","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t68 t54 t54 t28 t14 t25 t66 t14 t37 t50` and the grammar has a bunch of productions leading to terminals like 't0' to 't93' or so.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to only have productions of the form NTn \u2192 NTm NTk or NTn \u2192 'tX'. So that fits CNF.\n\nThe task is to parse the string using this grammar. Parsing context-free grammars can sometimes be done using a top-down approach like the CYK algorithm or bottom-up like a pushdown automaton. But since this is a small string, maybe a recursive descent parser could work, or at least a step-by-step approach.\n\nLet me note down the string to process: t68 t54 t28 t14 t25 t66 t14 t37 t50. Hmm, wait, the user wrote `t68 t54 t28 t14 t25 t66 t14 t37 t50`\u2014that's 9 tokens, so each token is a terminal.\n\nNow, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the top-level production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Each of these non-terminals (NT6 and NT34) will produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI need to see if the entire string can be generated starting from S. So the length of the string is 9 tokens, which is a multiple of certain factors, but more importantly, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols (either non-terminals or terminals). Starting from S (which is two non-terminals), each expansion doubles the number of symbols. But since trees can have varying depths, the total number of terminals isn't necessarily a power of two, but the way the productions work, it's a bit more flexible.\n\nWait, but the string here has 9 tokens. That's odd because each production either adds more non-terminals or a terminal, but in any case, the number of terminals generated should form a certain structure. Maybe I should look at the terminal symbols and see if they can correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string tokens: 68,54,28,14,25,66,14,37,50.\n\nI need to check if there's a way to derive this string by expanding S step by step, substituting non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to use a bottom-up method, checking each position in the string against the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be split into production sequences starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using a parse tree.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be built step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is to generate a left part (NT6) and a right part (NT34). The entire string must be these two parts concatenated.\n\nSo the first two tokens in the string would be part of either NT6 or NT34. Wait, no, the entire string must be the concatenation of NT6 and NT34. So the first half of the string would correspond to NT6, and the second half to NT34? Not exactly, because NT6 and NT34 can themselves be sequences of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, each non-terminal can produce a sequence of terminals and other non-terminals, and we need to check if the entire string can be generated by traversing these.\n\nAnother way is to track possible positions where each non-terminal can be responsible for generating a particular substring.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Maybe I should look for any immediate productions in the grammar that match the string's tokens.\n\nLooking at the given rules, for example, NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34. And in the string, we have tokens 12, which might be part of this.\n\nWait, but in the given string, let's list each token and their positions:\n\n1: t68\n\n2: t54\n\n3: t28\n\n4: t14\n\n5: t25\n\n6: t66\n\n7: t14\n\n8: t37\n\n9: t50\n\nHmm, perhaps I should see if each production can be mapped to these tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm could help, which parses the string based on the grammar's productions.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where each cell represents whether a substring can be derived from a particular non-terminal. So for string with n tokens, we have n rows and n columns, and each cell (i,j) represents the substring from i to j.\n\nBut setting up the CYK table for a 9-token string would require a 9x9 table, which is manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps for CYK:\n\n1. Initialize the table with each single token corresponding to a non-terminal. So for each token in the string, check which non-terminals produce that token.\n\n2. For each cell (i,j), fill it by looking for non-terminals that can produce the substring from i to j.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nFirst, the string is t68 t54 t28 t14 t25 t66 t14 t37 t50.\n\nWe can map each token to possible non-terminals:\n\n- t68: Let's see which NTs produce 't68' in the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see ND78's productions:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for example, rule NT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11. Hmm, but I don't see a rule where any NT directly produces t68.\n\nWait, let me scan the productions for any NT that directly produce a 't68'. Scanning through all the productions:\n\nLooking for 't68' in the r.h. sides of any production. So for example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (but that doesn't produce t68). Wait, no, looking through the list, I don't see any rule directly producing t68. So the only way to produce t68 is via a production that includes a non-terminal, say, A \u2192 B C, where B produces something, C produces something, and their combination includes t68. But that might be too indirect.\n\nHmm, perhaps t68 is not directly produced by any NT, meaning it must be a result of combining two non-terminals. So to get t68 in the string, one of the NTs in the parse tree must somehow produce t68 as the first symbol in a two-symbol production.\n\nWait, but let's see. Let me check: looking through the rules, perhaps none of the NTs directly produce 't68', so that would mean it has to be the leftmost symbol in a production that consists of two symbols where one is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the productions listed, each NT production either has two NTs or a terminal. So for example:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT72\n\nBut that doesn't include 't68'.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the given rules:\n\nLooking for 't68' in the r.h. sides, maybe the NT12 rule is NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34.\n\nBut in the list, the productions are for NTs, so perhaps t68 is produced by NT6?\n\nLooking at the rules again:\n\nLooking down the list:\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't72'\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't12'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nWait, I don't see any production that directly produces 't68'. Wait, maybe I missed one.\n\nWait, let me scan through the entire list again:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 't68'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't72'\n\n- NT6 is also involved in other productions like NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, so not directly 't68'\n\nHmm. So maybe 't68' is not directly a terminal of any NT. So to get 't68' in the string, it must be the result of a node in the parse tree that produces two symbols, one of which is 't68', and the other is another symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the NTs produces 't68' as the first symbol in a two-symbol production.\n\nLooking through the rules again for any NT \u2192 't68...'\n\nWait, I don't see any NT producing 't68' directly, so maybe t68 is part"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in CNF, which means each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see a lot of rules where a non-terminal breaks down into two others or a terminal. The terminals are all 't' followed by some number, like t68, t40, etc. So the string we're checking is a sequence of these terminals: t68 t40 t37 t61 t10 t0 t14 t81 t50.\n\nSince each production can only generate two non-terminals at a time, the derivation of the string must have a leftmost derivation that breaks it down into pairs, recursively, until reaching leaves that match the string. So I should check if the string can be built by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at S's production: S->NT6 NT34. So S must be replaced by NT6 and NT34. This means the first symbols in the string should come from NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: it starts with t68, then t40. Let's see what NT6 and NT34 produce. From the grammar:\n\nNT6 has productions:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (again)\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, but each production can only generate two non-terminals, so the leftmost symbol in the string (t68) must come from the leftmost NT6, which breaks down into either NT27 NT19, etc.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string: t68. Let's see which terminal corresponds to NT6. Scanning the grammar, under NT6, is there a production where NT6 directly gives a terminal? Looking at all the rules for NT6:\n\nNo, all productions for NT6 are two non-terminals. So that means the symbols generated from NT6 can't include a terminal immediately. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t68, which is a terminal. So that suggests that NT6 must be decomposed into symbols that eventually produce t68.\n\nLet me look at all the productions for NT6 and see which ones can lead to t68 somewhere in their derivation. Wait, maybe I need to see which non-terminals can derive to t68 or are involved in it.\n\nLooking at the terminals:\n\n- t68 is under NT12: NT12->NT14 NT0\nBut wait, let me look at each production that has a terminal. For example:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 (both non-terminals)\nNT22 -> NT25 NT24 (both non-terminals)\n\nBut I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT1 -> 't61' is a terminal, so when NT1 is replaced, it just gives t61.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals are produced by their respective non-terminals.\n\nWait, to clarify, in the grammar, each production either produces a terminal string or a non-terminal, but since it's CNF, each production must produce exactly two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut if a non-terminal is in a production, it can only split into two non-terminals, so the terminals in the string must come from leaves in the derivation tree.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of non-terminals ultimately leading to these terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a series of terminals, so each must be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar, via a series of productions. So to parse the string, each terminal must be matched by some non-terminal and its derivation must produce that terminal.\n\nSo let's try to map the string. The first symbol is t68. Which non-terminals can derive t68?\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which productions end with t68.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT12 has a production NT12->NT14 NT0, but NT14 and NT0 also produce other things. Wait, wait\u2014looking at each production for NTs:\n\nLooking for NT that produce t68. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\nIs there any NT that can produce t68 directly? From the rules, I don't see any NT with a direct production to t68. So t68 must be the result of a non-terminal that ultimately produces t68.\n\nHence, we need to see if any non-terminal has a production that includes the path leading to t68.\n\nLooking at NT12: NT12->NT14 NT0. NT14 is in the grammar as NT14->NT27 NT7, and so on. Similarly, NT0 is in NT10's production.\n\nLet me try to find which NTs produce t68.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the productions that result in terminals are:\n\n- NT1->t61\n- NT6->t20 (from NT6->t20), wait, no: wait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nWait, wait, hold on.

{"custom_id":"request-174","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t66 t66 t14 t45 t67 t41 t53 t14 t81 t41`. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can be parsed using algorithms like CYK, which work by breaking down the string step by step according to the grammar rules. Since the grammar is given in Chomsky normal form, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. But some of the right-hand sides have terminals, so I need to check if those terminals appear correctly in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT34. So the string should start with a production that expands to NT6 NT34. The string starts with `t66 t66`, which might correspond to NT6 producing 't66' directly, as in NT6 -> 't66' (appearing several times in the grammar). \n\nLet me check each symbol in the string to see if they're either terminals or derived from the grammar rules. \n\nThe first symbol is `t66`. Looking at the grammar, NT6 can produce 't66' according to several rules like NT6 -> 't66' (from NT0 -> 't66'), NT6 -> 't20' is not, but the terminal 't66' is directly produced by NT6. So `t66` is valid.\n\nThe second `t66` is another NT6, same as the first.\n\nSo after S, we have NT6 NT34. The string so far matches `t66 t66`.\n\nNow, let's look at the third token, which is `t14`. Wait, that's just a single symbol. According to the grammar, NT34 is a terminal 't3', so that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the NT34 production.\n\nWait, no, looking back, NT34's production is in the grammar: NT34 -> 't3'. So if the production is NT34, then in the string it should be 't3'. But in the string, after the second `t66`, it's `t14`, but in the grammar, NT34 can only produce 't3'. So that's a problem. Hmm, that suggests that `t14` might not be correct. \n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in how the grammar was presented. Looking back, the grammar has several rules where NT34 is on the left, like NT34 -> 't3'. So the right side is just 't3'. Therefore, if NT34 is part of the string, it should only have 't3', not anything else. \n\nBut in the string, after `t66 t66`, we have `t14`, which doesn't match 't3'. So that seems off. Did I misinterpret the grammar? Let me re-examine.\n\nIn the grammar, there are entries like NT14 -> NT2 NT1, which probably eventually derive to terminals. But for the third token, it's `t14`. If NT34 produces 't3', then that would mean 't14' is not allowed in the string from NT34. So perhaps this step indicates that the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step where NT34 can be expanded into a sequence that may include 't14'. But looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that has NT34 on the left. Only NT34 -> 't3'. So NT34 can't be further broken down; any occurrence in the string must be exactly 't3'. Therefore, having `t14` as the third token is impossible because NT34 can only produce 't3'.\n\nWait, but the initial production is S -> NT6 NT34. So the entire string should be derived from this. But in the string, after NT6 (t66), the next part is NT34, which is 't3', but the string after `t66 t66` is `t14`, so that's where the issue is.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because after `t66 t66`, we have `t14` and the grammar doesn't allow that. It should be `t3` instead.\n\nSo, the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers. \n\nLet me list out all the productions to get a clear picture:\n\n- S -> NT6 NT34\n- NT14 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT20 -> NT15 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT1 NT34\n- NT19 -> NT24 NT21\n- NT22 -> NT6 NT19\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT17\n- NT11 -> NT27 NT28\n- NT10 -> NT14 NT31\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT1 -> NT14 NT28\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT22 -> NT4 NT15\n- NT33 -> NT31 NT17\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT11\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT20\n- NT31 -> NT22 NT0\n- NT12 -> NT14 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT18 -> NT17 NT10\n- NT10 -> 't77'\n- NT19 -> 't47'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT22 -> 't77'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't29'\n- NT27 -> 't72'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT21 -> 't37'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n- NT18 -> 't22'\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't11'\n- NT18 -> 't53'\n- NT22 -> 't38'\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT22 -> 't10'\n- NT20 -> 't45'\n- NT17 -> 't40'\n- NT14 -> 't72'\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n- NT6 -> 't80'\n- NT2 -> 't28'\n- NT21 -> 't81'\n- NT21 -> 't29'\n- NT4 -> 't36'\n- NT25 -> 't49'\n- NT25 -> 't57'\n- NT24 -> 't14'\n- NT10 -> 't84'\n- NT31 -> 't43'\n- NT10 -> 't40'\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n- NT21 -> 't71'\n- NT11 -> 't83'\n- NT12 -> 't68'\n- NT11 -> 't54'\n- NT19 -> 't23'\n- NT4 -> 't39'\n- NT11 -> 't67'\n- NT15 -> 't18'\n- NT34 -> 't41'\n- NT22 -> 't25'\n- NT20 -> 't66'\n- NT34 -> 't50'\n- NT6 -> 't52'\n- NT17 -> 't54'\n- NT31 -> 't35'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n\nHmm, I notice that some NTs are defined with the same production. For example, NT22 is defined twice: NT22 -> NT6 NT19 and NT22 -> NT4 NT15. That might be important because it allows for multiple paths to the same symbol.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t37 t72 t66 t39 t66 t54 t0 t22 t23 t3`. Let me break this down by each token:\n\nThe string is a sequence of 10 tokens. Let's list them:\n\n1. t37\n2. t72\n3. t66\n4. t39\n5. t66\n6. t54\n7. t0\n8. t22\n9. t23\n10. t3\n\nI need to find a derivation path starting from S that results in exactly these symbols in order.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S -> NT6 NT34. So, S must expand into NT6 and NT34. So, I can represent this as:\n\nS => NT6 NT34\n\nSo, each part of this expansion will generate a part of the string.\n\nNext, let's look at NT6. In the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWait, in the user's message, they have some duplicates in NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 and NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, but I think that's a mistake because earlier, I thought NT6 had two different productions but now when looking again, it seems there might be more or perhaps some duplicates. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the productions under NT6 are:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nYes, those are the three. So, in the current grammar as given, NT6 can expand into three different things: NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, or NT21 NT25.\n\nThen NT34 has two productions:\n\n- NT34 -> 't3' (i.e., terminal)\n- NT34 -> 't50' (another terminal)\n\nSo, after S, we have NT6 and NT34, each of which can produce some combination. Let me map out the possibilities.\n\nLet's try to see which options for NT6 and NT34 can produce the desired tokens.\n\nOur string starts with 't37'. Looking at NT6 and NT34, let's see which can produce 't37'.\n\nLooking at NT34: the two terminals are 't3' and 't50'. Neither are 't37', so the 't37' must come from NT6.\n\nSo, the first token, 't37', must come from NT6. So, looking at the possible expansions of NT6:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWe need to see if any of these can produce 't37' in the expansion.\n\nLooking at each:\n\n1. NT27 can expand into 't72' (from NT27 -> 't72') or 't73' (since NT27 has two productions: NT27 -> 't72' and NT27 -> 't73'). Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, NT27 has:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait, let's correct that. Looking back at the user's grammar:\n\nWait, under NT27, the productions are:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4? No, that's under NT15.\n\nWait, looking back correctly:\n\nThe user's grammar for NT27 is:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, no, the correct productions are:\n\nLooking back:\n\nUnder NT27, the user wrote:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nWait no, that's not right. Let me check the user's grammar carefully:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nNo, I think the user made a mistake.

{"custom_id":"request-197","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions are either generating two non-terminals or a single terminal. That makes parsing easier, but here I just need to check if the string is generated by the given grammar.\n\nThe given grammar has several non-terminals (NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals (t numbers and 't' followed by numbers). Each production rule seems to break down the non-terminals into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. I notice that some non-terminals have similar productions, so maybe they're part of the same tree or something.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t68 t66 t28 t72 t66 t54 t35 t54 t73 t47 t3`.\n\nI'll start by trying to match the string from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first step is to see if the string can be formed by expanding NT6 and NT34.\n\nLet's look at NT6's productions. Scanning through, I see NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 and also NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19. So, both these options. Then, NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17, right? Because in the grammar, NT34 is only listed as NT31 NT17. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34 would expand to either NT27 NT19 NT31 NT17 or NT33 NT19 NT31 NT17.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, the first token is t68. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t68. Scanning through the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 't66', which is close but not t68. Let's check all NT productions for terminals.\n\nLooking through NT1, NT2, NT6, etc., I see NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules, the terminals are things like t66, t72, t54, t47, t3, and others like 't28', 't45', 't20', etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t68. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing t68. Let me check all NT productions for terminals.\n\nLooking through each non-terminal:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'.\n\nNT1 \u2192 't61'.\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20', 't80', 't28' (from the rules like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 and others). Wait, when I look at NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, and also NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, and NT6 \u2192 NT23? Wait, no, I don't see NT6 \u2192 NT23, so maybe I misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWait, yes, there's also NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25. So that's another option. So, for NT6, possible terminal outputs include t20, t28, t33, t52, t54, etc. But in the string, the first is t68, which isn't listed. Hmm, that's a problem. Because when expanding S, the first step is to get NT6 and NT34, and none of these seem to produce t68.\n\nWait, maybe the productions for NT12 or others can help. Let me check other non-terminals. Looking for something that can lead to t68.\n\nWait, maybe I missed NT31 \u2192 't35', which is another terminal. Hmm, but I'm not seeing t68 anywhere. Let's check again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT6 has multiple expansions, but I don't see t68. Let me check for each non-terminal whether any can produce t68. Let's go through each NT.\n\nNT0: 't66' and 't73' (from NT0 \u2192 't66' and 't73').\n\nNT1: 't61', etc.\n\nNT2: 't28'\n\nNT4: 't29', etc.\n\nNT6: as above.\n\nNT7: 't66', 't73'\n\nWait, I don't see any non-terminal that can produce t68. That's a red flag. So, even before the tree, the first token is t68, but no non-terminal seems to generate t68.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the NT6 productions. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nAlso, earlier in the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25 is a production, but that's for NT6. So, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, then NT21 can produce which terminals?\n\nLooking at NT21:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT22 NT0 and NT21 \u2192 NT7 NT7.\n\nWait, so NT21 can lead to 't77' via NT22? Wait, no. Let me check NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19, and also NT22 \u2192 't47', 't72', etc. Specifically, in the production list, I see NT22 has several 't' terminals, like 't47', 't77', 't10' (wait, maybe more). Let me list all NT22's productions.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15\n\nNT22 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't10' (from earlier in the grammar, I think it's NT22 \u2192 NT10 't77')\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial rules, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 is defined as:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15\n\nNT22 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't47'\n\nAnd elsewhere:\n\nLooking further, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77', NT22 \u2192 't10', etc. Wait, perhaps I need to list each production of NT22.\n\nLet me compile all NT22 productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\n- NT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't66' (is that correct?) Wait, looking back, in the initial grammar list, I see:\n\nWait, no. Let me go through the grammar again carefully.\n\nIn the grammar provided above, the NT22 productions are:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT4 NT15\n\nNT22 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77' (from NT10 \u2192 't77')\n\nWait, no, looking at the initial list:\n\nThe NT22 rules are:\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\n\nNT22 -> 't72'\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might have missed the others.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grammar and the steps needed to derive the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT6 NT34. So, the derivation must start with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Let me note that down: the first two symbols should be whatever NT6 and NT34 produce, but these are terminals in the given string. Wait, looking at the string, the first token is t77, so I need to see what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nWait, the NT6 production can have different rules. Let me check. There are several NT6 rules. One of them is NT6 \u2192 t20, another is NT6 \u2192 t27 NT19, and another is NT6 \u2192 t33 NT19. So, NT6 can produce a terminal or a combination of NTs.\n\nIn our string, the first token is t77. Looking at NT6 rules, is there any production where NT6 directly gives t77? Let me check. There's NT27 \u2192 t77, NT7 \u2192 t73, but wait, NT6 isn't directly t77. Wait, did I get that right? Let me see: The NT6 rules are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> t20\nNT6 -> t33 NT19\nSo, the first symbol in the string is t77. So, how would NT6 start with t77? Looking at the NT27 and NT7 rules, NT27 can produce t77 if it's the case, but does that fit into NT6?\n\nWait, another thought: the first production rule is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which in the string is the first two tokens. So, the first two symbols are t77 and t66. Wait, no\u2014the string is `t77 t66 t73...`, so the first symbol is t77 and the second is t66. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34 would produce something that starts with what NT6 and NT34 produce. So the first token is t77, but NT6 can't produce t77 directly.\n\nWait, but maybe NT6 is derived from more steps. Let me approach this by breaking down the string step by step. The string is:\n\n1. t77\n2. t66\n3. t73\n4. t73\n5. t66\n6. t66\n7. t73\n8. t54\n9. t14\n10. t29\n11. t3\n\nWe need to see if this can be derived starting from S.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths.\n\nThe first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first part is NT6, which needs to produce t77 at some point. Let's see how NT6 can produce t77.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 t20\n3. NT6 \u2192 t33 NT19\n\nNone of these directly produce t77. Wait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps I need to look for how NT27 can produce t77. So, NT27's production is:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t77\n\nYes! So, if NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and then NT27 \u2192 t77, that would make the first part t77. So, the first symbol is t77 derived from NT27, and then what about NT34? Let me check NT34:\n\nLooking at NT34's rules:\n\nNT34 \u2192 t3\n\nYes, so NT34 would produce t3 at the end of the string, so the last token is t3, which matches.\n\nSo far, the first token is t77 from NT27, the second token is t66. Let me check NT27 \u2192 t77, but in the string, the second symbol is t66. Wait, that seems to be a problem. Because according to this, the first symbol is from NT27, which would directly give t77, but the second symbol is t66, which would come from NT19, since NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, so the next symbol would be NT19's derivation.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused because I'm looking at the production rule for NT6 as NT27 NT19, so when NT27 produces t77, then what does NT19 produce? Let's see NT19's productions:\n\nLooking at NT19:\n\nNT19 \u2192 t47\n\nBut in the string, the second symbol is t66, not t47. So, that seems conflicting. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe NT19 can produce something else. Let me check:\n\nFrom the given grammar, the NT19 rules are:\n\nNT19 \u2192 t47\n\nThat's the only production. So NT19 can only produce t47. Therefore, if the second symbol is t66, that can't be derived from NT19. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first production is different. Let me think differently. The first symbol is t77. Looking for NT6 producing t77, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to NT6. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. So, if the NT6 is expanded into NT27 and NT19, and then NT27 \u2192 t77, and NT19 \u2192 something that gives the next token.\n\nBut NT19 only gives t47, which is different from t66. So, maybe that's not the path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol is derived not in the first step. Maybe S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is expanded into more NT symbols. Let's think about the structure.\n\nAnother approach: since the string starts with t77 and ends with t3, maybe I should track the derivation path from the end.\n\nThe last token is t3, which comes from NT34 \u2192 t3, so the last part of the derivation must be NT34 producing t3.\n\nBefore that, we have t14 (9th token). Let's see the production preceding it.\n\nLooking at NT24 \u2192 t14. So perhaps that's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the string's structure, maybe the derivation has several branches, so the symbols are the leaves of a tree. Let me try to parse the string by starting from the first symbol and seeing how it can be derived.\n\nWait, another plan: try to parse the string from left to right, seeing if each step can match the grammar rules. So, starting with the entire string, see if it can fit into the grammar.\n\nBut given the length, 11 symbols, and the way the grammar is structured, perhaps building a parse tree step by step is better.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nNow, the first rule is to produce NT6 and NT34, which in the string would correspond to the first two symbols: t77 and t66.\n\nWait, no. The string starts with t77 (position 1), then t66 (position 2). So, S produces two rules: NT6 and NT34, which in the string are the first two symbols. So, that would mean NT6 is t77 and NT34 is t66. But as I found earlier, NT34 can only produce t3, which doesn't match t66.\n\nSo that doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nAlternative approach: maybe the initial step is more complicated. Let's consider that NT6 could produce something that eventually becomes t77, and NT34 could produce something that becomes t66. But in the string, t66 is the second symbol, which is t66, so NT34 would have to produce t66. But according to the grammar, NT34 only produces t3. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me confirm: the grammar's NT symbols only have certain productions, which are given as NTx \u2192 ..., where x is a number, and the right-hand side is either a terminal or another NT symbol.\n\nSo, each NT symbol can expand into one or more NT symbols, or a terminal. Thus, when a NT symbol expands into another NT symbol, that would mean another production step is needed.\n\nBut the string has 11 symbols. So, perhaps the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is the starting point, and each NTx in the string corresponds to a NTx production in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map the string into the NT structure. Let's denote each token as the corresponding NT symbol, but that's not necessarily the case since NT symbols can expand into multiple NTs.\n\nBut the string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol is a terminal,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-211","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. It involves determining whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific way to structure context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I see rules like S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which fits the CNF since it's a non-terminal (S) producing two other non-terminals (NT6 and NT34). Similarly, some rules directly produce terminals, like NT10 \u2192 't77' or NT6 \u2192 't20'.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t28 t37 t14 t18 t0 t54 t66 t54 t77 t14 t71 t41`. I need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it's a right-linear grammar, meaning each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right side, or a single terminal. To derive a string, we can build a parse tree where each internal node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal. The string is generated by concatenating the terminals from the parse tree in the order they appear.\n\nI'll start by looking at the parse tree possibilities. The start symbol S has the production S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, S must derive to NT6 followed by NT34. Therefore, the string must start with the expansion of NT6 and then NT34.\n\nLet's break down NT6 and NT34:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 or NT6 \u2192 NT25 NT\u2026 Hmm, I see NT6 has some rules. Let me list all NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT25 NT1\nWait, actually, looking back, the initial list I have:\n\nNT6 has:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT25 NT\u2026\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, NT6 has some rules. Wait, in the initial user message, for NT6:\n\n- S \u2192 NT6 NT34\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT25 NT\u2026 Hmm, looking more carefully, after NT6 \u2192 NT25, there's another option: NT6 \u2192 NT25 \u2192 NT1, but not sure yet. Also, later in the list:\n\nLooking back, the user provided:\n\nNT6 is listed as producing 't20' as well? Wait, no, the very end of the grammar list has NT6 \u2192 't20', right? Wait, checking the end:\n\nYes, in the provided grammar, there's:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nSo NT6 can either produce 't20' directly or break down into other non-terminals. That's an important point because it means that in the parse tree, NT6 could be either a terminal or a combination of other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at NT34:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3' or NT34 \u2192 others? Wait, in the grammar:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3' and NT34 also has other rules?\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 't3' is one rule, but looking through the entire list, I don't see any other rules for NT34. So NT34 can only produce 't3'.\n\nSo, when we look at the initial string, the first part must be the expansion of NT6 followed by NT34. Given that NT34 \u2192 't3', then the first part is 't28' followed by 't37'?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t28 t37 t14 t18 t0 t54 t66 t54 t77 t14 t71 t41.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the first symbols should come from NT6 and then NT34. \n\nAssuming that the leftmost symbols are derived first. So, the first token should be the expansion of NT6, and the second should be 't3' (since NT34 only produces 't3'). Looking at the string, the first token is 't28' followed by something, but the second token is 't37', which may be part of the NT6 expansion. Wait, that suggests that the NT34's 't3' is in the string somewhere.\n\nWait, but the string is a series of tokens: t28, t37, t14, t18, t0, t54, t66, t54, t77, t14, t71, t41.\n\nSo, for S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the entire string must be the combination of NT6's expansion followed by NT34's expansion, which is only 't3'. Therefore, in the string, we would have [NT6 expansion...] t3, and the rest would have to correspond to the expansion of NT6.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the second token is 't37', not 't3'. That suggests that maybe the NT34 part is somewhere else, but since S must produce NT6 followed by NT34, the entire string should start with the expansion of NT6 and then continue with 't3'. But the string provided starts with 't28 t37', which would imply that NT6's expansion starts with 't28 t37'.\n\nBut according to the grammar, NT6 can produce 't20' directly, but in this string, the first token is 't28', which is not 't20'. Wait, looking back at the grammar rules, I think I might have missed something.\n\nWait, let me go back to the grammar. The very end has:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20' \n\nBut earlier, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or other combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for all possibilities of how NT6 can be expanded. Because each non-terminal can be either a terminal or break down further, so in the parse tree, it's a bottom-up process.\n\nBut wait, in this context-free grammar, the production rules are in CNF, so each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts. So, to get a string, we need to keep splitting non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nLet me try to see what the first symbol in the string is, 't28'. Let's see if any rule produces 't28'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, in the list, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT10 \u2192 't12'\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20' (direct)\n- NT4 \u2192 't39'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49' or 't57'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37' or others. Wait, looking at the grammar, there are multiple NT21 productions.\n\nLooking for 't28':\n\nWait, I don't see any rules directly producing 't28'. The productions must come from breaking down the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 't72'\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\nNT6 \u2192 't52'\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\nNT11 \u2192 't11' or 't54' etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not seeing it. Let me re-examine the grammar carefully.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77' or 't38', 't10', etc.\n\nWait, maybe 't28' comes from NT18 \u2192 't18' and another rule? Wait, no, NT18 \u2192 't18'? No, looking at grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT18 \u2192 't17 NT10' or other combinations, but in later parts, I see:\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the initial user message, for NT18, the rules are:\n\n- NT18 -> NT17 NT10 (twice)\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT10 \u2192 't12'\n\nWait, no, in the initial part, the grammar has multiple rules for some NTs.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, I can use standard parsing techniques or just try to reconstruct the derivation step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the start symbol, which is S, and according to the grammar, S directly produces NT6 NT34.

Let me list all the NTs that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through each NT symbol:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t66 and t73.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20', 't3', etc.\n\nWait, the provided rules seem to have multiple NTs producing different terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules near the end:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72'\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT9? Not in the rules. Wait, looking at production rules, some seem to be for the same NT. Wait, perhaps I need to list the terminals per NT:\n\nLooking through the production rules, some NTs produce terminals:\n\nFor instance, NT14 produces NT2 NT1 and sometimes has a rule like NT14 \u2192 't72' or others. Wait, actually, looking at the rules provided:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n\n- NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, and also NT19 \u2192 't47'\n\nWait, so NT19 can produce 't47'. Similarly, NT15 can produce 't65' (from NT15 \u2192 NT7 NT4 and also NT15 \u2192 't65'? Wait, checking:\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 and also can produce 't20' and 't52'?\n\nWait, looking:\n\nWait, in the provided rules, under NT6, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\n- Also, NT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through the production rules, after the NT34 part, the rules list:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n\nNT10 \u2192 't77'\n\nNT19 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77'\n\nWait, perhaps in the later part, NT6 \u2192 't20', other options.\n\nWait, looking through the last part:\n\nAfter NT34:\n\nSome rules for other NTs:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\n- NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't29'\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-233","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t28 t66 t65 t66 t72 t66 t11 t45 t67 t0 t22 t23 t3`. First, I'll try to understand the grammar and see if I can break down the string into the non-terminal symbols that generate it.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and makes it easier to see the derivation steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, so each part of the string must correspond to the right-hand side of some production. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the top-level derivation is S splitting into two parts: NT6 and NT34.\n\nI'll start by verifying if each part of the string can be derived from NT6 and NT34. Let's split the string into two parts based on S's production: the first half should come from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nThe string: t28 t66 t65 t66 t72 t66 t11 t45 t67 t0 t22 t23 t3\n\nSplitting into two parts of 6 tokens each (since S \u2192 NT6 NT34, each NT is a two-symbol non-terminal? Wait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or terminals. Wait, no, each production is two symbols on the right. Wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. So, each step in the derivation produces two symbols. So, the start symbol S will eventually produce two sequences of symbols, so the string length must be even. The given string has 13 tokens, which is odd. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the split is not into two equal parts, but each NT6 and NT34 will expand into sequences as well.\n\nWait, actually, in the end, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each NT in the productions will eventually produce a terminal. But for S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the two parts (NT6 and NT34) will each expand into sequences, and their concatenation must form the string. So, the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut the string has 13 tokens, which is an odd number. Each NT's expansion will produce a certain number of terminals. For example, if NT6 expands into 6 tokens and NT34 into 7 tokens, the total would be 13. So, that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NT6 and NT34 are themselves non-terminals that can expand into multiple symbols, but their expansions must combine to make the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the possible expansions of NT6 and NT34 and see if their concatenation matches the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find what each NT6 and NT34 can produce.\n\nFirst, NT6. From the grammar, NT6 has two productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nSo, NT6 can produce two parts: either NT27 and NT19 or NT33 and NT19.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 can produce:\n- NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n\nCheck the productions for NT34: looking at the list, yes, NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17, which is its only production.\n\nSo, the string is a combination of NT6 and NT34's expansions.\n\nLet's see what the possible expansions of NT34 are. Since it's derived from NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17, which is a pair of non-terminals. So, NT31 and NT17 will each expand into something.\n\nLooking at NT31, in the grammar, it has several productions:\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 (wait, that's a recursive production)\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT22\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n- NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (from the grammar)\n- NT0 \u2192 't66'\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I need to list all productions for NT31. Let me check:\n\nThe grammar for NT31 includes:\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT22\n- NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\n- NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0\nWait, wait, looking through the grammar again:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT17\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT7\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT22\n- NT31 -> NT31 NT0\n- NT31 -> NT22 NT0\n- NT31 -> NT22 NT0\n- NT31 -> NT6 NT19\nWait, no, in the list provided, the grammar for NT31 includes the production:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\n- line 31: NT22 -> NT10 etc.\n\nWait, let me read through the grammar carefully line by line.\n\nThe grammar has the following:\n\nLooking for NT31:\n\n- Line 7: NT22 -> NT6 NT19\n- Line 13: NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- Line 15: NT19 -> 't47'\n- Line 25: NT25 -> 't39'\n- Line 27: NT21 -> 't37'\n- Line 37: NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- Line 38: NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n- Line 40: NT17 -> 't66'\n- Line 41: NT18 -> 't22'\n- Line 43: NT10 -> 't12'\n- Line 44: NT11 -> 't11'\n- Line 46: NT18 -> 't53'\n- Line 47: NT22 -> 't38'\n- Line 48: NT34 -> 't3'\n- Line 49: NT33 -> 't55'\n- Line 53: NT22 -> 't10'\n- Line 63: NT17 -> 't40'\n- Line 64: NT14 -> 't72'\n- Line 65: NT7 -> 't66'\n- Line 66: NT7 -> 't73'\n- Line 68: NT6 -> 't80'\n- Line 69: NT2 -> 't28'\n- Line 70: NT21 -> 't81'\n- Line 71: NT21 -> 't29'\n- Line 73: NT4 -> 't36'\n- Line 74: NT25 -> 't49'\n- Line 75: NT25 -> 't57'\n- Line 76: NT24 -> 't14'\n- Line 77: NT10 -> 't84'\n- Line 79: NT31 -> 't43'\n- Line 80: NT10 -> 't40'\n- Line 81: NT33 -> 't30'\n- Line 82: NT21 -> 't71'\n- Line 83: NT11 -> 't83'\n- Line 84: NT12 -> 't68'\n- Line 85: NT11 -> 't54'\n- Line 86: NT19 -> 't23'\n- Line 87: NT4 -> 't39'\n- Line 88: NT11 -> 't67'\n- Line 89: NT15 -> 't18'\n- Line 90: NT34 -> 't50'\n- Line 91: NT22 -> 't25'\n- Line 92: NT20 -> 't66'\n- Line 93: NT34 -> 't50'\n- Line 94: NT6 -> 't52'\n- Line 95: NT17 -> 't54'\n- Line 96: NT31 -> 't35'\n- Line 97: NT0 -> 't66'\n- Line 98: NT2 -> 't37'\n\nWait, looking for NT31's productions:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see that NT31 has the following production:\n\n- Line 96: NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and one non-terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, let me look at the string: `t37 t72 t66 t73 t73 t45 t67 t66 t83 t50 t22 t47 t50`. It's a sequence of symbols, each looking like 'tXXXX'. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, some non-terminals produce specific terminal symbols. For example, NT1 produces 't61', NT2 produces 't28', and so on. I'll need to see what non-terminals can derive the starting symbol S and how many steps it takes to generate the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which directly produces NT6 and NT34. So I'll break down the string into parts that match these.\n\nLooking at the string, let's split it into two parts: the first part derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nStarting with the first part: t37. Let's check what NT6 can produce. I see NT6 -> 't27', 't33', or 't52', plus other rules that might lead to terminals. But the first symbol is 't37', which isn't directly listed. Wait, there's a rule NT21 -> 't37'. So for NT6, does it have a production that leads to NT21? Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking back, NT6 has a production: NT6 -> NT21 NT25 and another NT6 -> 't20' among others. Wait, I need to see if any rule for NT6 leads to NT21.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT6 -> NT27 NT19. Hmm, that's one rule, but I'm looking for NT6 -> NT21. Let me scan through all NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> ... etc.\n\nAh, yes! There's a rule NT6 -> NT21 NT25. So to produce the first part of the string starting with 't37', which is 't37', that would come from NT21 -> 't37'. So the first part of the derivation is NT6 -> NT21 NT25. Now, NT21 -> 't37' and NT25 -> 't49'. Wait, but the second part is 't72', so maybe I need to check how these fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more straightforward to look for each terminal symbol and see which non-terminals they can come from.\n\nLet me list all the terminals and see which non-terminals produce them:\n\n- 't37' comes from NT21.\n- 't72' comes from NT14 and others. Let me check: NT14 -> 't72'.\n- 't66' can come from NT0, as well as several others. For example, NT0 -> 't66'.\n- 't73' comes from NT7.\n- 't45' comes from NT20.\n- 't67' comes from NT15.\n- 't83' comes from NT11.\n- 't50' comes from NT34.\n- 't22' comes from NT22 and others.\n- 't47' comes from NT19.\n- 't50' again from NT34.\n\nWait, so the string starts with 't37', which comes from NT21. So the first part must be NT21 -> 't37' and nothing else because it's a terminal. But wait, does NT21 have any production that includes a terminal followed by other symbols? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I don't see NT21 having a production that includes a non-terminal except for its direct terminal production. So NT21 directly produces 't37'.\n\nSo the first symbol is produced by NT21. Then the next symbol is 't72', which comes from NT14. So looking at NT14's production: NT14 -> 't72', so NT14 directly produces 't72'. \n\nSo after the first part, I have NT21 -> t37, and the next is NT14 -> t72.\n\nSo the derivation starts as S -> NT6 NT34. Now, the first part is NT6, which we determined can produce t37 through NT21. So after S, the first non-terminal is NT6, which is expanded to NT21 NT25. But then, in the string, the first symbol is 't37' (from NT21), and the next is 't72', which would come from NT14. So perhaps after NT6, it's NT21 and another NT25. But wait, the first part is just 't37', so maybe NT6 is producing 't37' via NT21, and the rest is generated via NT25?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is: t37 t72 t66 t73 t73 t45 t67 t66 t83 t50 t22 t47 t50.\n\nSo the first symbol is t37, which comes from NT21. So the first part must be S -> NT6 NT34, and then NT6 -> NT21 NT25. But after that, the string continues. Wait, let's think about the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S -> NT6 NT34, and the NT6 generates the first part, while NT34 generates the second part.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nFirst part: t37 t72 t66 t73 t73 t45 t67 t66 t83 t50.\n\nWait, that's 10 symbols. The second part: t22 t47 t50, which is 3 symbols.\n\nWait, maybe that's not correct. Let me count: the string has 13 symbols. If S -> NT6 NT34, then the string is divided into NT6's part and NT34's part. The entire string's length must be compatible with the number of productions. For a Chomsky Normal Form, each production adds one symbol, so the number of symbols would be one more than the number of productions. But I'm not sure about this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by NT6 and NT34. Let's try to see what each part would generate.\n\nStarting with NT6:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT6 can produce several things. Looking for a way to get t37, which is from NT21. So NT6 -> NT21 NT25.\n\nBut then, after that, the string continues with t72, which is from NT14. So perhaps the next part is NT25 generating t72. Wait, but NT25's production is not terminal; let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules for NT25: No, there doesn't seem to be a terminal production for NT25. Wait, no, I might have missed it. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see NT25 having a terminal symbol. Hmm. So perhaps NT25 produces another non-terminal, which eventually leads to t72.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Instead of trying to split the string immediately, I should try to build the string step by step according to the grammar.\n\nLet me start from the start symbol S and try to generate parts that match the string.\n\nSo S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nNow, the first step is S, which becomes NT6 NT34. Let's see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT6 can produce NT21 NT25, and NT34 can produce 't3' because in the rules, NT34 -> 't3'. So that would be a terminal. Wait, but in the string, the first symbol is t37, not t3. So that approach doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to see if NT6 can produce a terminal. Looking at the grammar, some NT6 rules do lead to terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-257","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is in the language defined by the grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, I see a bunch of productions where non-terminals split into other non-terminals or terminals. Some of them end with terminals like 't72', 't66', etc., so those seem to be the leaf nodes.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t72 t66 t83 t41 t40 t72 t71 t49 t14 t37 t0 t73 t23 t50. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is to split the string into two parts according to this rule. Looking at the string, the first part would be the first few symbols, and the second part would be the remaining symbols. But wait, I'm not sure how the string is split because NT6 and NT34 can have different lengths based on their productions. So I might need to explore different possible splits.\n\nLet me list out the productions for NT6 and see how they can expand into a sequence ending with t72, t66, etc. NT6 has several productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (another one listed)\nNT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (appears twice)\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (another one)\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (another one)\nWait, actually, I think some are duplicates. Let me check each production for NT6:\n\nLooking back, the NT6 productions are:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (duplicate line)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7 (triple duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (triple duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19 (duplicate)\nWait, this seems like there are multiple duplicates. I think the unique productions for NT6 are:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19\n\nSo five unique productions for NT6. Now, I need to see if any of these can lead to the t72 at the beginning.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT6, let's see their first symbols:\n\n- NT27: looking at the table, NT27 has a production NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two options: t66 and t73. So NT27 can expand to t66 t66, t66 t73, t73 t66, or t73 t73. So the first NT6 production would lead to sequences like t66 t66 t19... but not sure yet. Alternatively, if the first part is t72, maybe NT27 is not the way. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, wait. The first part of S is NT6 NT34. So if the string starts with t72 t66 t83..., I need to see how NT6 and NT34 can produce these. Let's take the first few symbols: t72, t66, t83.\n\nLooking at the grammar, where can t72 come from? It's either a terminal (like in NT27, which can produce t72) or from some non-terminals. So let me check which productions have terminal symbols.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT27 has NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two terminals: t66 and t73. NT6, when expanding, can produce NT27, which expands into t66, t73.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to build a parse tree. Starting from S: S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the string starts with something derived from NT6, followed by something from NT34. The string starts with t72, t66, t83, etc. So let me see what NT34 produces.\n\nLooking at NT34's productions:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17\nNT34 \u2192 NT22 NT21\nNT34 \u2192 NT0 NT0 (Wait, no, looking at the productions, I don't see NT34 \u2192 NT0 NT0. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT34 rules, I see:\n\nNT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17\nNT34 \u2192 NT22 NT21\nNT34 \u2192 NT14 NT37\nWait, no, looking again, the actual productions are:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT34:\n- NT33 NT17\n- NT31 NT17\n- NT22 NT21\n- NT14 NT37\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check all NT34 productions.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT34:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n- NT34 \u2192 NT22 NT21\n- NT34 \u2192 NT14 NT37\n\nWait, I might have miscounted. Let me go through each NT34 production:\n\nStarting line: \"NT34 -> NT33 NT17\"\n\nYes, one production: NT33 NT17.\n\n\"NT33 -> NT31 NT17\" \u2014 no, this is under NT33.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all NT34's productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 NT33 NT17\n- NT34 \u2192 NT22 NT21\n- NT34 \u2192 NT14 NT37\n\nWait, actually, how many productions does NT34 have? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list, under NT34 I see:\n\n- NT34 -> NT33 NT17\n- NT34 -> NT22 NT21\n- NT34 -> NT14 NT37\n\nWait, that's three, but the initial count may be longer. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check the full list again.\n\nLooking again, under NT34: three rules? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps for now, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, from NT34, the possible expansions start with NT33, NT22, or NT14.\n\nLooking at the string, after t72 comes t66. So the first part after S is t72 from NT6, then comes t66, which could be from NT34.\n\nWait, but let's think step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo, the entire string is a sequence generated by NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nSo the first part (the initial symbols) must be derived from NT6, and the rest from NT34.\n\nThe string is: t72 t66 t83 t41 t40 t72 t71 t49 t14 t37 t0 t73 t23 t50.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nNow, what's the minimal split? For example, the first token from NT6 is t72? But wait, in CNF, each production either ends in a terminal or is expanded further. So in NT6, whether it can produce t72 directly. But from the productions of NT6, I don't see any direct terminals except in NT27 and NT17, for example.\n\nWait, looking at NT27: it has a production NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two productions, one of which is t66 and another t73.\n\nSo, if NT27 can produce t66 t66, t66 t73, t73 t66, or t73 t73, can the first t72 come from NT27? Hmm, no, because NT27's first symbols are t66 or t73, so for the first t72 to come from NT27, it's not possible. So perhaps the NT6 doesn't produce t72 directly, but through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, but all the NT6 productions go into other"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.

{"custom_id":"request-270","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t28 t72 t66 t67 t0 t40 t72 t10 t66 t73 t54 t66 t14 t37 t50`, which I guess is a sequence of symbols like t28, t72, etc. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). In CNF, each production rule has either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. But looking at the grammar, I see a mix of two symbols on the right, but some are terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So in this grammar, some rules are two non-terminals, others are terminals. So maybe it's not strictly CNF, maybe it's a mix. Or perhaps the initial step is to parse the string using this grammar.\n\nThe approach is to use the Top-Down parsing method, probably Leftmost Derivation, which is typical for CNF. So I'll start by taking the start symbol S and see how it can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S must split into NT6 and NT34. Then the string should start with the symbols that NT6 and NT34 expand into.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t28. Let's see what NT6 and NT34 can derive to. \n\nNT6 can expand in several ways. Let me list NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 (duplicate, so maybe it's one unique production here)\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n5. NT6 is also in NT27's productions.\n\nBut in the string, the initial t28 comes after the start symbol is S, which branches into NT6 and NT34. So the string starts with NT6's expansion. Let's see.\n\nWait, actually, the initial S produces NT6 NT34, which must produce a string that is the combination of NT6's expansion and NT34's expansion. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo the string starts with t28, which may be either from NT6 or NT34, but since NT6 and NT34 are separate, it's more likely that the first part comes from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nLet's see what NT6 can expand to. Let's check the options:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- Wait, but there's also NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, which I think is the same as the second option. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nNow, looking for the symbols in the string, the first token is t28. Let's see what t28 can correspond to.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, many NTs have terminals. For example:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t72 or t76? Wait, let me check the rules.\n\nWait, I need to go through each terminal production to see which one matches t28.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t37\n- NT4 \u2192 t29, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal symbols to see which NT corresponds to t28.\n\nLooking at all the terminals:\n\n- t7 -> for NT7\n- t28 is given as the first token.\n\nLooking through the grammar, are there any NTs that produce t28?\n\nYes, NT27 \u2192 t72 or t73. So maybe not.\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the rules for NT7 are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t66 or t73.\n\nWait, the t72 and t73 are given under NT7.\n\nLooking for t28, perhaps it's in an NT that has a production of NT21. Wait, NT21 has a terminal rule like t37. So maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me go through each NT and see what terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking in the grammar:\n\nNT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1 (both non-terminals)\nNT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0\nNT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34\nNT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 (so it's a recursive rule)\nNT11 \u2192 NT27 NT28\nNT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31\nNT31 \u2192 NT31 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or others.\nNT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28\nAnd so on.\n\nLooking at the terminal symbols given in the grammar:\n\nLooking for t28 in any NT's productions. For example, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT21 \u2192 t37\n- NT4 \u2192 t29\n- NT25 \u2192 t49, t57\n- NT24 \u2192 t14\n- NT10 \u2192 t84, t40, t84 is already there.\n- NT31 \u2192 t43, t30, t35\nWait, maybe I'm missing where t28 comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in NT21 \u2192 t37, so not.\n\nLooking through the rules, I can't find any NT that directly produces t28. Hmm, that's a problem because the first symbol in the string is t28, which can't be derived from any NT rule in the grammar. So that would mean the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, I might be missing something. Let me check all the NTs to see if any produce t28.\n\nLooking through each NT and their possible terminal outputs:\n\n1. NT14: only non-terminals, so no.\n2. NT20: only non-terminals.\n3. NT12: non-terminals.\n4. NT19: produces t64? No, looking at NT19's rules: NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21, then NT24 produces t14, NT21 produces t37. So neither produce t28.\n5. NT22: branches into NT6 and NT19, but those don't produce t28.\n6. NT31: various rules leading to t7, t17, etc.\nWait, looking at NT11: NT11 \u2192 NT27 NT28, so that would produce t28 at the end? Or is it t28? Wait, in the rules, NT27 \u2192 t72 or t73, and NT21 \u2192 t37. So NT11 can't produce t28 directly.\n\nWait, wait, looking again, I noticed that NT21 has a rule NT21 \u2192 t37, which isn't helpful. Is there any NT that can produce t28?\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production. Let me go through each NT.\n\nWait, maybe NT0 has a production with t66. Wait, no, it's t37 for NT21. So no, t28 isn't directly produced by any NT in the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the entire list:\n\nLooking through each NT and their terminal symbols, it seems that none of the NTs directly produce t28. For example, NT27 produces t72 or t73, NT21 produces t37, NT4 \u2192 t29, NT25 \u2192 t49 or t57, etc.\n\nGiven that, the first token in the string is t28, which cannot be derived by any NT in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar looks a bit complicated, but let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol isn't on the right side. The given grammar seems to follow that, with S being the start symbol and productions like S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which are two non-terminals each.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t0 t66 t29 t66 t29 t3 t22 t45 t54 t50 t54 t77 t14 t29 t41`. It's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. So I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to reverse-engineer the derivation. Starting from the string and working back to the start symbol S. It's easier because S can only produce two non-terminals, so the string length should be a power of 2 multiplied by some factor, but let's see.\n\nThe string has 15 elements. Wait, 15 is odd. Hmm, because each production in CNF replaces one non-terminal with two, so the number of symbols derived from a single non-terminal should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps. But since S is the start symbol, it first produces two non-terminals, each of which can produce more non-terminals, leading to an even number of symbols each time. So the total number of symbols (excluding the start symbol) should be 2^k, but perhaps with some initial replacements.\n\nWait, the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the first step gives two symbols, but the string has more symbols. Hmm, maybe it's built up by multiple steps. Let me try to break down the string.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't41'. Looking at the grammar, which rules produce 't41'? Scanning the production rules, I see NT34 \u2192 't3' and NT24 \u2192 't14', but in the given string, the last symbol is 't41', which isn't directly in the rules I have.

{"custom_id":"request-292","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is quite complex with multiple non-terminals and terminals, and the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of tokens.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol can't be on the right-hand side of a production. The grammar provided here seems to fit this structure because all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t29 t3 t54 t28 t66 t18 t66 t28 t29 t66 t11 t45 t67 t43 t23 t41`.\n\nI remember that in CNF, the leftmost derivation is used to parse the string. So, I'll approach this by trying to break down the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me list out the productions again to see where each terminal in the string can come from.\n\nLooking for 't29' first. Scanning the productions, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n- NT17 \u2192 't73'\n- NT7 \u2192 't66'\n- NT7 \u2192 't73'\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't29'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29' (also NT4 \u2192 't39', but I think the first occurrence is 't29' at NT4)\n- NT34 \u2192 't3' (this is for T34)\n- NT27 \u2192 't72'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45' (from NT20 \u2192 't45')\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT22 \u2192 't77'\n- NT11 \u2192 't83'\n- NT12 \u2192 't68'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT10 \u2192 't12'\n- etc.\n\nSo, I notice that 't29' can be derived from NT6 and NT4. Let me see which one makes sense in the context.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT6 and NT34. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34, each of which must be expanded into terms.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be built starting with NT6 and NT34.\n\nThe first part of the string is 't29 t3 ...', which suggests that NT6 might expand to 't29', but let me check:\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 production:\nNT6 can be 't29' from NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT6 also has other productions, but I think the relevant one here is when NT6 \u2192 't29' (since in NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT21 \u2192 't37', but also NT4 \u2192 't39' perhaps).\n\nWait, actually, looking back, in the productions, NT6 appears in multiple places. Let me check each production for NT6:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT6 is:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nAnd in the terminals:\n- NT6 \u2192 't29' (I think, from looking through the productions, since NT6 \u2192 't29' isn't listed directly except perhaps indirectly via NT4?)\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The productions for NT6 are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 't20' (I think, but actually, looking through the list, I don't see NT6 \u2192 't20'. Wait, no, looking more carefully:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n- NT6 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't33 NT19'\n- etc.\n\nWait, the user provided the productions in a long format, but I might have misread it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, the user listed:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 't29' (from NT6 \u2192 't29'? Or was it another non-terminal?)\n\nWait, actually, looking at the list:\n\nLooking for 't29' under NT6:\n\nYes, under NT4 \u2192 't29' and NT6 \u2192 't29' might not be directly listed, but let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 appears here: NT6 \u2192 't20'?\n\nWait, no, in the list provided, I don't see NT6 \u2192 't20' directly. Instead, NT6 has multiple productions:\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nThe productions for NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> 't29'\n\nWait, no, in the user's list, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 't29' (I think I see that, yes. Let me check: The user listed under NT6:\n\nWait the user wrote:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n- NT6 -> 't29'\n\nWait, looking at the list:\n\nYes, under NT6, the third option is 't29'.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has:\n\n- NT4 -> NT15 NT4\n\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n\nWait, so both NT4 and NT6 can produce 't29'. So in the first part, the string starts with t29, which can come from either NT4 or NT6.\n\nBut the string is: t29 t3 t54 t28 t66 t18 t66 t28 t29 t66 t11 t45 t67 t43 t23 t41.\n\nSo the first token is t29, which could be from NT4 or NT6. Let's assume it's from NT6 for now, as the start symbol S is NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo the first expansion would be NT6 \u2192 't29', and then the next part should be NT34.\n\nBut let's check: starting with NT6, the first expansion is 't29', and the second part is NT34. But wait, the string is t29 t3..., so after t29, there's t3. So the next part after t29 should be part of the expansion of NT34.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So both NT6 and NT34 need to generate a sequence that results in the given string.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake. Let me correct that. The string is parsed as a sequence of productions, and since it's leftmost derivation, we pick the leftmost non-terminal to expand first.\n\nWait, but in this case, the start symbol S produces NT6 NT34, so the first step is to expand NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo the first two symbols generated would be the results of NT6 and NT34. Let me check.\n\nThe first token is t29, which could come from NT6. Let's assume that. Then, the next token should come from NT34. Let's look at N34.\n\nLooking through the productions for NT34:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n\nSo, NT34 can directly produce 't3'. That would explain the second token being 't3'.\n\nSo far, we've got t29 (from NT6) and t3 (from NT34). Then the next token is t54, but wait, after t3, the next in the string would be t54 as the third token. But wait, the string is:\n\nt29 t3 t54 t28 t66 t18 t66 t28 t29 t66 t11 t45 t67 t43 t23 t41\n\nSo after t29 and t3, the third token is t54.\n\nSo, after the initial S \u2192 NT6 NT34 generating 't29' and 't3', we now need to process the rest of the string as the expansions of the remaining symbols.\n\nWait, but that approach might not be correct. Maybe instead, after S \u2192 NT6 NT34, we should consider that the first two tokens are 't29' and 't3', but then the rest of the string needs to be generated from the subsequent expansions of NT6 and NT34, but wait, NT6 and NT34 are separate non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-293","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t66 t66 t72 t18 t66 t28 t14 t66 t22 t65 t66 t54 t66 t22 t23 t41` is generated by the given CFG. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT6 NT34. So the first step is to see if the string can be derived from S.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. I'll map each terminal to the appropriate non-terminal based on the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first symbol in the string should come from NT6. The string starts with t66, which seems to match NT6\u2192't66'. So the first part works.\n\nNow, the production rules for NT6 are:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nWait, in the given CFG, NT6 has several productions, including NT6\u2192't20' or NT6\u2192't52' etc. But in our case, the first step is S\u2192NT6 NT34, which leads to t66 (NT6\u2192't66'), but how does NT6 lead to the next symbols?\n\nWait, no. Actually, S produces NT6 NT34, but in the string, the first symbol is t66, so that should correspond to either NT6 or NT34. Looking up NT6's productions, I see that NT6 can produce 't66' directly, which matches the first t66.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 \u2192 (something) resulting in the first t66. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the next part: after S, we have NT34. So the second symbol should be what NT34 produces. Looking at NT34's productions, the options are:\n- NT34 \u2192 't3'\n- NT34 \u2192 't33'\n- NT34 \u2192 't50'\nWait, in the given CFG, the productions for NT34 are:\nNT34 \u2192 't3'\nNT34 \u2192 't33'\nNT34 \u2192 't50'\nWait, no. Looking back, the user provided a long list of productions. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, NT34 produces 't3' directly. So the second symbol should be t3 if NT34\u2192't3', but in our string, the second symbol is t66, not t3. Wait, that's an issue.\n\nWait, no. Let me check again. The string is: t66 t66 t72 t18 t66... So the first symbol is t66 (from NT6), the second is t66. Looking back at NT6: 't66' is one option, but after that, NT6 can produce other combinations. So perhaps the initial step is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nThe string is: [t66, t66, t72, t18, t66, t28, t14, t66, t22, t65, t66, t54, t66, t22, t23, t41]\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t66. Let's see how NT6 can be expanded. NT6 can directly produce 't66'. So the first node is NT6 \u2192 t66, consuming the first symbol.\n\nNow, the remaining string is: [t66, t72, t18, t66, t28, t14, t66, t22, t65, t66, t54, t66, t22, t23, t41]\n\nNext, after NT6's t66, the next symbol is t66. What follows NT6 in the production? Wait, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so after producing NT6, which yields t66, the next is NT34, which can produce 't3', 't33', 't50', etc. None of these are 't66'. Wait, in the string, the second symbol is t66. That suggests that after NT6 produces t66, the next symbol should come from NT34, but NT34's initial options are 't3', 't33', 't50'. None of these are 't66', which contradicts the string.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in looking up the productions for NT6.\n\nLet me recheck the productions for NT6. In the grammar, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT64 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT19\nBut wait, in the given CFG, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT20\nWait, let me re-examine the entire grammar to get all the NT6 productions correctly.\n\nLooking at the full list:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT6 NT20\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT80 NT19 (Wait, no, the user's grammar has NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6\u2192NT33 NT19, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all NT6 productions:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT63 NT19?

{"custom_id":"request-309","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t73 t29 t0 t37 t29 t18 t66 t11 t65 t66 t11 t3 t22 t14 t29 t3`.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that CNF grammars have productions where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string must be a series of terminal symbols, so I need to trace a leftmost derivation or something similar to see if the string can be produced.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of non-terminals (NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals which are various tXX like t0, t3, etc. The start symbol is S, and the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the initial symbols to derive are NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t0. So the first non-terminal must derive to t0. Looking at the productions, NT10 \u2192 't77', NT10 \u2192 't12', but no, wait, in the grammar, NT10 has two productions: NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31 and NT10 \u2192 't12'. So to get t12, it can be as is. But in the string, the first symbol is t0, so perhaps we're using the production NT0 \u2192 't66' or NT0 \u2192 't0'. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT0 has two productions: NT0 \u2192 NT22 NT0 and NT0 \u2192 't66'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar for NT0 is NT0 \u2192 't66' and NT0 \u2192 't0'. Also, looking at NT1's productions, NT1 has NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28 and NT1 \u2192 't29' and other productions leading to terminals. Hmm, I might be confused.\n\nWait, I need to map the string correctly. The string is a sequence of t's with numbers. Each word in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol. So the derivation should generate this sequence step by step.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first symbol, t0. So I need to find a non-terminal that can produce t0. Looking at the non-terminals, I see NT10 and NT0. Let me check:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66' or NT0 \u2192 't0' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see NT10 \u2192 't77' among others. Also, NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 't66' and NT0 \u2192 't0'. So NT0 can derive t0 or t66.\n\nWait, the first token in the string is t0. So perhaps we'll use NT0 \u2192 't0'. But where does NT0 come from? Let's see how NT0 is produced. Looking at the grammar, NT0 has production NT0 \u2192 NT22 NT0, which is unusual because it's NT0 on both sides. Alternatively, NT0 \u2192 't66' or NT0 \u2192 't0'.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the string from the start symbol. S is the start, so S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the starting symbols are NT6 and NT34. Each of these non-terminals will contribute a part of the string.\n\nSo I need to see if NT6 can generate some part of the string and NT34 can generate another part.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 or NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT25 or NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7 or NT6 \u2192 't80' or NT6 \u2192 't20' or others.\n\nWait, let's list all NT6 productions:\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed some. Let me compile all NT6 productions from the given grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT25 (wait, does NT6 have this? Or is it another NT? Let me check the grammar again.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar provided, the relevant NT6 productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 (duplicate?)\n\nWait, let me scan again. The user provided the grammar as a list, with each line like \"NT6 -> NT27 NT19\", \"NT6 -> NT33 NT19\", etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT6 has two productions:\n\n1. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n2. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n3. Also, lines 10 and 12:\n\n10. NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\n12.

So only two productions for NT6 as NT27 NT19 and NT33 NT19.\n\nWait, no, no. Let me clarify. The user provided a list of grammar productions. Each line is like \"NTx -> NTy NTz\" or \"NTx -> a\", where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking specifically, for NT6:\n\nI find lines:\n\n14. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n15. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n16. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWait, no, line 16 is NT21 -> NT7 NT7.\n\nSo, looking for NT6, I see:\n\n14. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n15. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nSo, NT6 has two main productions leading to non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, let me re-check all the lines with NT6 as the left-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- Line 6: NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n- Line 7: NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n- Line 16: NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\n- Line 12: NT21 -> NT7 NT7\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up with NT6 and others. Let me list all NT6 lines:\n\nAfter careful re-examination, I see that NT6 has the following productions (as per the original grammar):\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nLine 14: NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nLine 15: NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nWait, no, perhaps line 14 and 15 are NT6's productions. Let me count:\n\nThe grammar starts with:\n\n1. S -> NT6 NT34\n\nThen, NT6:\n\n2. NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\n3. NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\n4. NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\n5. NT6 -> NT22 NT25\n\n6. NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\n7. NT6 -> 't20'\n\n8. NT6 -> 't80'\n\nWait, wait, no. The original grammar is a list, so each line represents a production.

{"custom_id":"request-318","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, and the string to check is `t28 t0 t45 t0 t45 t29 t18 t66 t11 t18 t66 t67 t66 t22 t14 t29 t50`. \n\nFirst, I should remember what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal symbol. So, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, it seems that all productions follow this structure. Each non-terminal on the left is expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which fits the form A \u2192 BC. \n\nNow, the string to check is made up of terminal symbols. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions of the grammar.\n\nI think the approach here would be to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing strings in CNF grammars. The CYK algorithm works by building a table to see which non-terminals can produce substrings of the input. It fills the table in a dynamic programming way, checking all possible ways the string could be split into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the string by breaking it down step by step using the given productions. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that introduces a terminal. \n\nLet me list out the productions that directly produce terminals because that might help in breaking down the string:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n- NT22 \u2192 't77' (in two productions, but same terminal)\n- NT24 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49' and 't57' (so two options)\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' and 't80'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29' and 't36'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37' and 't81'\n- NT6 \u2192 't80' and 't52'\n- NT2 \u2192 't28' and 't20'... Wait, wait. Actually, looking back, some of these might have different terminals, but I need to check each production carefully.\n\nWait, the problem statement gives the grammar, so I should focus only on the given productions. Let me look at each production that expands to a terminal:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20' and 't80' (is that the case? Wait, looking back: NT6 has two productions, one to 't27 nt19' and another to 't52' because looking at the grammar, it's split into multiple rules, so for example, NT6 -> 't20' is under another rule, perhaps?\n\nWait, actually, in the given grammar, some of the NT symbols expand into combinations of other NTs and possibly terminals. So for example, NT6 is present in several productions, some of which are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT22 NT49? No, looking again, it's:\n\nWait, let me go through each production:\n\nStarting from the top:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nThen NT14 -> NT2 NT1\n\nWait, I think to avoid confusion, perhaps I should list all production rules that produce terminals because those are the leaves we need to use in building the string.\n\nLet me pick through each production rule in the grammar:\n\n- NT14: production is NT2 NT1. Both are non-terminals, so this produces two symbols, not a terminal.\n\n- NT20: production is NT15 NT0. Both non-terminals.\n\n- NT12: NT1 NT34. Both non-terminals.\n\n- NT19: NT24 NT21. Both non-terminals.\n\n- NT22: NT6 NT19 and another NT6 and something else? Wait, let me list all the productions that lead to terminals:\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't61' (terminal)\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20' (terminal) and another production to 't52'?

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a bunch of productions from non-terminals (NT) to other symbols or other NTs. I notice that some of these productions are actually terminal symbols with specific 't' values. For example, NT10->'t77' and others.\n\nThe string to check is: `t28 t37 t29 t45 t11 t66 t68 t22 t45 t67 t3 t54 t37 t14 t43 t14 t29 t41`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. To do this, I should probably trace a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate the given string.\n\nStarting from S, according to the grammar, S produces NT6 NT34. So the string must be a concatenation of two parts: the first part derived from NT6, and the second from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t28, which is part of NT6. Let's focus on the first part: t28 t37 t29 t45 t11 t66 t68 t22 t45 t67 t3 t54 t37 t14 t43 t14 t29 t41.\n\nWait, maybe I should break the string into tokens since it's a linear sequence. Let me list them in order: t28, t37, t29, t45, t11, t66, t68, t22, t45, t67, t3, t54, t37, t14, t43, t14, t29, t41.\n\nHmm, that's 18 tokens. Now, I'll work on each part.\n\nFirst, ND6 (I think the NT6 is a non-terminal symbol, but in the string, it's represented as 't28', so maybe I need to see where each 't' comes from.\n\nWait, maybe I should reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart: S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the string must be A followed by B, where A comes from NT6 and B comes from NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if the first part can be split into A and B.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to process the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S can only be split into NT6 and NT34, so the entire string must be [something generated by NT6] concatenated with [something generated by NT34].\n\nLet me see how each NT can be expanded.\n\nNT6 has several productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT21\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t28. Let's see where t28 comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT21\u2192't37', NT27\u2192't72' or 't66', etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at how each terminal might be generated.\n\nt28: looking through the grammar, I see NT21\u2192't37', NT27\u2192't72', etc. No NT directly produces t28. Wait, maybe t28 comes from a derivation step.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Let me list all the productions again for clarity, especially those that have terminal symbols.\n\nLooking back, NT6 has several rules, some of which terminate early:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT21\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT7\n\nSimilarly, there's another NT2 which I think is a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be NT21, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, are there any NT6 productions that produce 't' symbols?\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT21 \u2192 't37'\nNT27 \u2192 't72' or 't66'\nBut nowhere does it directly produce 't28'.\n\nHmm, perhaps 't28' comes from a chain of productions. So, for example, if NT27 is expanded into other NTs until we hit a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT27\u2192NT7 NT7, and NT7\u2192't66' or 't73'.\n\nWait, wait, let me list all NT7 productions:\n\nNT7\u2192't66' and NT7\u2192't73'.\n\nSo, if NT27\u2192NT7 NT7, then it becomes 't66' 't66' if both produce t66, or 't73' 't73' if both produce t73. But in the string, we have a single t28. So that can't be possible because NT27 would produce two ts, not one. Therefore, the initial t28 suggests that NT6 must produce something that leads to a single 't28' symbol.\n\nBut looking at NT6 productions, none directly produce 't' symbols except for the ones listed above. So, for example:\n\nTT is part of the string, but no NT directly yields t28. So perhaps the derivation is such that NT6 and NT34 produce strings that together form the correct sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all NTs that directly produce t28 or any t's.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT1 \u2192 't29'\n- NT27\u2192't72', 't66'\n- NT22\u2192't38', etc.\n\nWait, no NT directly produces 't28' by looking through the list. Only 't20', 't29', etc., are directly assigned.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t28, that would have to come from a non-terminal that eventually reduces to 't28'. But in the grammar provided, none of the NTs directly produce 't28'. That's a problem. So perhaps the string can't be generated because there's no production for NT that ends in 't28'.\n\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the list of NTs and their productions:\n\n- NT27 has two options:\n   NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n   NT27 \u2192 NT6 NT25\n\nWait, no, 't28' isn't here. Wait, actually, looking through all the NTs, none produce t28.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t28, and none of the NTs produce t28, then the string can't be generated by this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-331","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding what's given.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where A is a terminal. So all rules are straight and atomic steps.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols: `t72 t45 t68 t22 t66 t73 t66 t18 t0 t72 t18 t66 t11 t50 t40 t40 t23 t50`. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is to check if the first two symbols of the string match NT6 and NT34. But according to the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal, so it should expand into some terminals. Looking at the productions, NT6 \u2192 't20' or 't80' or other options? Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT6 we have several productions:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nAnd also, under other rules like NT27 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nWait, but in the start symbol, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals that must expand into some other symbols until we get to terminals.\n\nBut for the string beginning with t72, which is a terminal symbol, so the first derivation step from S must start with NT6 expanding into some production that starts with a terminal leading to t72.\n\nLooking at the various NT6 productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19: But NT27 and NT19 are non-terminals, so this won't produce a terminal immediately. So the expansion must be such that NT6 can produce t72.\n\nLooking deeper, NT27 is a non-terminal. Checking NT27's productions:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nAnd NT7 has two productions: NT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'.\n\nSo if I take NT7 \u2192 't66', then NT27 \u2192 't66' 't66'. Alternatively, NT7 \u2192 't73' gives 't73' 't73'.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is 't72', so how does that tie into NT6?\n\nLooking back, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't20' or 't80' or other options, but none directly go to 't72'. Oh, unless one of the non-terminals connected to NT6 can produce 't72' when expanded.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't72 t45 t68...', so the first two symbols are t72 and t45.\n\nHmm, so the first production after S is NT6 and NT34. So I'll have to see how NT6 can produce a 't72' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the productions of NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT7 \u2192 't66' or 't73'\n\nSo for NT27, if both expansions go to 't73', then NT27 \u2192 't73' 't73'. That would contribute 't73' and 't73' as the two symbols for NT6's expansion.\n\nSo NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 becomes 't73' 't73' followed by whatever NT19 expands to.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is 't72', so unless there's another path where NT6 directly starts with 't72', but I don't see that. Wait, maybe I missed a production of NT6.\n\nLooking again at all productions, under NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of these can lead to 't72'.\n\nLooking at NT21: NT21 has productions:\nNT21 \u2192 NT37 NT28\nNT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11\nNT20 \u2192 NT45 (but NT45 is derived from other things) and so on.\n\nWait, maybe I need to trace through all possible derivations, but that's going to take a lot of time, perhaps too much considering the string is 18 symbols long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for the string in the grammar's parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt72 t45 t68 t22 t66 t73 t66 t18 t0 t72 t18 t66 t11 t50 t40 t40 t23 t50.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't72', which comes from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only way 't72' can appear is if a terminal production is present. Looking through the given productions:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't72' (from NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 't73' or 't66'; but no, wait, earlier I thought NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, but looking back, that's not the case. Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I need to find where a non-terminal directly goes to a terminal 't72'. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT27:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nUnder NT27, no rule directly gives 't72'.

{"custom_id":"request-352","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, understanding the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this, with most rules transforming non-terminals into two non-terminals and a few into terminals (indicated by the rules ending with something like 't72' or 't45').\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t72 t73 t29 t0 t72 t0 t22 t45 t66 t66 t65 t0 t11 t50 t54 t84 t14 t71 t50`. I notice there are spaces, but in context-free grammars, strings are sequences of terminals, so each token separated by space is a terminal symbol.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of substitutions. Let's look at the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step is to see if the string can be broken down as starting with NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t72. Let's see what NT6 can produce. Checking the grammar rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 has the following productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 (duplicate)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (duplicate)\nWait, maybe I need to list them more clearly from the given grammar:\n\nFrom the given grammar, I can see:\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nSo NT6 can be split into three possible combinations. The first token is 't72', which is the terminal for NT6 in some production.\n\nLooking at the terminal assignments:\nNT6's productions produce different terminals when expanded all the way. For instance, in NT17, NT6 is rewritten as 't66'. Wait, perhaps it's better to list all terminals.\n\nWait, the grammar provides each production as a sequence of non-terminals or terminals. For each production, I need to see what terminals it eventually expands to.\n\nFor example, NT6's production is, say, NT6 -> NT27 NT19. Then I need to see what NT27 and NT19 expand to.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should perform a step-by-step expansion of the string using the grammar rules.\n\nLet's list out all the productions for each non-terminal and their terminal equivalents:\n\nNT6 can produce:\n- NT27 \u2192 't72', NT19 \u2192 't47' \u2192 so NT6 \u2192 t72 t47\nWait, let me check each production for NT6:\nFrom the given grammar:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, I see:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and NT27 \u2192 't72', so NT6 can become 't72' paired with something else.\n\nSimilarly, other NT6 productions may lead to other terminal combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to parse the string from left to right using the grammar rules, trying to match possible non-terminals and expanding them step by step.\n\nBut before that, let's note that the first token is t72. So the first production should produce something starting with t72.\n\nLooking at S -> NT6 NT34, so the string must start with whatever NT6 produces, followed by NT34.\n\nGiven the first token is t72, let's see what NT6 can produce. From the grammar, if NT6 can produce 't72' as the terminal, then let's check possible derivations.\n\nLooking at production NT6 -> NT27 NT19, and since NT27 produces 't72', then if NT27 is followed by NT19, which produces 't47'. So NT6 as a whole could be 't72 t47'.\n\nBut the first token in the string is t72. So if NT6 \u2192 t72 t47, then after that, we have to have NT34. But let's see what NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT34's productions in the grammar:\nNT34 \u2192 't3' (from NT34 -> 't3'). Wait, but looking back:\nIn the grammar, several rules have 't34' followed by something else. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, the given grammar has some rules that directly terminate with terminals. For example:\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\nNT4 \u2192 't29'\nNT27 \u2192 't72'\nNT1 \u2192 't61'\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me list all terminal productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\nNT19 \u2192 't47'\nNT22 \u2192 't77'\nNT27 \u2192 't72', 't73', 't66', etc.\nWait, no: looking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't77' appears multiple times. So each NT22 can be t77 if the production is 't77'. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't20'.\n\nWait, I need to list each non-terminal and what terminals they can produce directly. Let me go through each production:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT34\n2. NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1\n3. NT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n4. NT12 \u2192 NT1 NT34\n5. NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\n6. NT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19\n7.

{"custom_id":"request-374","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar has multiple non-terminals (NTs) and terminals (t0 to t84, t2's), which correspond directly to parts of the string we're checking.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with whatever NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLet me break down the string: \"t28 t72 t66 t61 t50 t53 t18 t66 t14 t3 t54 t72 t35 t18 t66 t11 t0 t53 t23 t50\".\n\nI can split it into individual terminal symbols: [\"t28\", \"t72\", \"t66\", \"t61\", \"t50\", \"t53\", \"t18\", \"t66\", \"t14\", \"t3\", \"t54\", \"t72\", \"t35\", \"t18\", \"t66\", \"t11\", \"t0\", \"t53\", \"t23\", \"t50\"].\n\nSince S starts with NT6 and NT34, the entire string must be generated by NT6 and NT34. So I need to make sure that the production rules for NT6 and NT34 can generate the left-hand side (NT6) and right-hand side (NT34) of the string, respectively.\n\nStarting with NT6 \u2192 ... Looking through the grammar, NT6 has several productions, for example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19. Hmm, also NT6 \u2192 't20' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but NT6 is on both sides of S's initial production. So the first step is to see how the string can be broken down. Since the string starts with \"t28\", let's check if NT6 can produce \"t28\".\n\nLooking at NT6\u2019s productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT6 \u2192 't80'\n- NT6 appears on the right side as well.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 has the production NT6 \u2192 't20' and another production NT6 \u2192 't80', but I also see that NT6 produces other combinations as well. Let me list all the productions for NT6:\n\nLooking back at the grammar provided, NT6 is defined as:\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7 [Wait, checking the grammar again: I think I might have some missing because in the initial user message, the grammar list is extensive.

{"custom_id":"request-373","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t28 t66 t45 t72 t66 t11 t66 t11 t66 t14 t50 t53 t18 t0 t11 t3 t53 t14 t29 t41`.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the production rules fit this CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is a rule with two non-terminals, and others like NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1 are similar. Some rules have terminals on the right, like NT14 \u2192 't29'.\n\nSo, to check if the string is generated, I think I can approach this by using a recursive descent parser or maybe a CYK algorithm since it's a CNF grammar. But since it's a small string, maybe a top-down approach would work.\n\nAlternatively, I can try matching the string by breaking it down step by step. Each part of the string should correspond to the terminals in some production.\n\nLet me write down the string and see if I can find a way to derive it. The string is: t28 t66 t45 t72 t66 t11 t66 t11 t66 t14 t50 t53 t18 t0 t11 t3 t53 t14 t29 t41.\n\nI think it's helpful to start from the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated by expanding S.\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the entire string should be divided into two parts, the first part derived from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nNow, let's split the string into these two parts. But the problem is I don't know where to split. Maybe I can check what each production for NT6 and NT34 leads to.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6: The production rules for NT6 are:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT50?

No, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 has these production rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT31 NT19\nWait, no, here's the full list:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19 (Line 6)\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19 (Line 9)\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25 (Line 14)\n- NT6 -> NT31 NT19 (Line 24)\n- Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, NT6 is defined as:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n... etc.\n\nNow, looking specifically for NT6's rules, I can see that NT6 has multiple rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (Line 6)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 (Line 9)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (Line 14)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT31 NT19 (Line 24)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT25 (Line 46)\nWait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-389","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems like the grammar is composed of several non-terminals (like S, NT14, NT15, etc.) and terminals (like 't0', 't28', etc.). The start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals, adhering to CNF rules.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t28 t72 t66 t29 t50 t22 t45 t67 t73 t39 t66 t67 t50 t40 t72 t35 t40 t40 t54 t47 t3`. This string seems to consist of a sequence of 21 tokens. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to find a derivation path using the given rules. Since CNF grammars generate only two symbols at each step, I can start from the end and see if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into its components: [t28, t72, t66, t29, t50, t22, t45, t67, t73, t39, t66, t67, t50, t40, t72, t35, t40, t40, t54, t47, t3].\n\nStarting from the last element 't3', I can check which productions result in 't3'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55' which isn't relevant here. Wait, no, looking again, I see NT33 -> 't55', which isn't matching. Wait, let's check:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\nNT31 -> 't43', 't50', etc. Hmm, looking for 't3', the only place I see it is in NT34 -> 't3'. Yes, so 't3' must be produced by NT34.\n\nSo the last symbol t3 is matched by NT34, which is the left-hand side of the production NT34 -> 't3'. So that works.\n\nNow, the part before 't3' is the substring up to t47. Wait, maybe I should approach this as a sequence, so each production expands into two symbols, which themselves can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, I need to split the string into pairs and see if each pair can be produced by a production rule.\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Let me think differently. The string is a sequence of symbols. Since the grammar uses CNF, each step in a derivation produces exactly two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, to check if the string is valid, it must be a valid derivation sequence, which can be processed by a recursive descent parser or similar, but manually, I can try to match it.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the leftmost derivation, but it might get complicated. Another approach is to use the fact that in CNF, the derivation can be represented as a parse tree where each node has exactly two children, and the leaves are terminals. So, the string must correspond to a sequence of terminal symbols that can be generated by such a tree.\n\nI'll try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning. So, let's look at the entire string as a list:\n\n1: t28\n2: t72\n3: t66\n4: t29\n5: t50\n6: t22\n7: t45\n8: t67\n9: t73\n10: t39\n11: t66\n12: t67\n13: t50\n14: t40\n15: t72\n16: t35\n17: t40\n18: t40\n19: t54\n20: t47\n21: t3\n\nLet me try to split this string into pairs of symbols, considering that each production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, but actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A-> a where a is a terminal. Wait, no\u2014if it's in CNF, all productions are of the form A -> BC with B and C as non-terminals, or A-> a with a terminal. So each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by 1, starting from the start symbol.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC (two non-terminals) or A \u2192 a (terminal). So, when generating a string, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols (either non-term or non-term, or non-term and terminal, or terminal and non-term, depending on the production).\n\nThis makes it a bit tricky to parse the string because each production adds one symbol, so a production of length k would have a string length of 2^k - 1. But for a given string, it's not clear which production could have generated it immediately. So perhaps a better approach is to look for possible splits of the string into two parts where the last symbol can be matched by a non-terminal's production, then recursively check the remaining substring.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build a parse tree from the end, using the rightmost derivation (since the grammar might be ambiguous, but since I'm checking whether the string is in the language, it's acceptable to find at least one successful path).\n\nSo, I'll try to parse the string from the end, i.e., starting with the last symbol and moving backward, checking which productions can match.\n\nLet's start:\n\nThe last symbol is t3. From the grammar, the production NT34 -> 't3' is available. So, the last symbol must come from NT34. Therefore, the string must have been derived as ...NT34. Now, the substring before 't3' is the string without the last symbol: the first 20 symbols.\n\nWait, but how does this work? Let me think: the entire string is of length 21, so if the last symbol is derived from a production that ends with a terminal, then before that terminal, the other side would have to be a non-terminal. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model this as a recursive approach. Let me denote the function as can Derive(s) where s is a substring, and I check if it can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nBut since the start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals, I can split the string into two parts after the first production, but that might not be straightforward because the splits between symbols can vary depending on the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the better approach is to model the entire string as being built from the start symbol S, which first splits into NT6 NT34. Then, each of these non-terminals will produce their own children, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut since the given string is a straight sequence of terminals, each step must reduce a non-terminal to a terminal or a combination that eventually results in all terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I can work backwards from the end. Let's see:\n\nThe last symbol is t3, which must come from NT34. So, the previous symbol before t3 is t47. Now, the symbol before that is t40, etc. But this approach might not be directly applicable. Maybe another way: let's see the possible ways each terminal can be derived.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to look up a way to model the string generation using the given rules.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start by looking for the production that generates each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT6 can produce various non-terminals and terminals. For instance, NT6 -> 't20' is listed. Wait, looking through the grammar, there are several NTx that produce 't20', 't28', etc.\n\nWait, here's the list of grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the productions, I can note that several non-terminals produce terminals like 't20', 't28', etc.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 -> 't20' is at the end, line 20: yes.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 -> 't66' (line 0: yes).\n\nNT27 -> 't72' (line 27: yes).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me try to list all the non-terminals and their production options:\n\n1. NT14: NT2 NT1 (only)\n2. NT20: NT15 NT0\n3. NT12: NT1 NT34\n4. NT19: NT24 NT21\n5.

Since the grammar provided has RHSs with two non-terminals, it fits the CNF criteria. So, any string generated by this grammar will consist of terminals only, as non-terminals are expanded into terminals through production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, all elements are terminals. For example, 't29', 't3', etc. There are no non-terminals in the string, so the next step is to see how the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nNext, since the grammar is in CNF, it's helpful to consider that the generation process starts from the start symbol, which here is S. The initial expansion of S is NT6 NT34, so the string must eventually derive to something starting with these components.\n\nTo approach this, I think a possible method is to try and parse the string from the start, using the grammar's productions.

Now, looking at the string, it starts with 't29', followed by 't3', 't40', and so on. Let me note some important terminals that correspond to specific NTs:\n\n- 't29' appears in NT1, NT6 (twice), and NT21 (twice). So, NT1 -> 't29'; NT6 -> 't20' one way, 't29' another; NT21 -> 't37', but wait, NT21 also has a rule NT21 -> 't29' another way. Wait, no: looking back, I see NT21 has multiple RHS options. Specifically, NT21 -> 't37' and could also be 't29' if another rule exists. Let me check: No, looking at the production rules, I see NT21 has two productions: one to 't37' and another to 't29'. Wait, no: Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT21 is defined as:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT21 -> 't37'\n\nAnd also:\n\nNT21 -> NT21 NT11? Wait, no, let me check the list again.\n\nLooking up from the list:\n\nYes, I see NT21 has two productions:\n\nLooking at the list, there's \"NT21 -> 't37'\" and also \"NT21 -> NT21 NT11\". Hmm, that seems different because of the way the NTs are defined. So, perhaps NT21 can be expanded into 't37' or into NT21 NT11. So, in the string, 't37' is part of it, so perhaps that's a hint that one of the NTs in the expansion is NT21, which directly becomes 't37'.\n\nWait, but in the string, after 't40', it's 't66'. Let's see, 't66' corresponds to several NTs, like NT0, NT10, NT14, NT17, NT18, NT20, NT21, etc. So, perhaps a point where one of the productions would produce 't66' as a terminal.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into possible groupings based on the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, every symbol in the string must be either a terminating terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. So, let's consider the string as a series of tokens and see if they can be linked by the grammar's productions.\n\nLet's start analyzing the string step by step, looking for possible pairings.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt29 t3 t40 t66 t65 t0 t37 t72 t45 t83 t65 t0 t67 t52 t14 t37 t66 t66 t66 t47 t3\n\nI need to parse this string as possible combinations of non-terminals expanding into terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation would involve two non-terminals, which would resolve into two terminals each, and so on.\n\nLet me attempt to decompose the string into such steps.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, and given that the grammar is Chomsky Normal Form, any terminals in the derivation must come directly from the productions of non-terminals. So, let's see.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which expands to NT6 NT34. So, the entire string should be reachable from this combination. NT6 and NT34 each can expand into pairs or terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, there are 21 tokens. Let's count: 21 't's and other terminals.\n\nWait, the string has 21 tokens: t29"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is `t28 t66 t66 t0 t45 t14 t18 t0 t67 t45 t54 t66 t29 t66 t73 t73 t66 t67 t41 t53 t47 t50`.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars can generate a wide range of languages, but since this is in CNF, each production rule either has two non-terminal symbols or a terminal symbol. That makes parsing easier using algorithms like the CYK algorithm, which checks if a string is in the language defined by a given grammar.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I should try to parse the string here or manually trace through the grammar rules. Parsing the string might be tedious, especially since the string is quite long. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to break it down.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that several symbols eventually produce terminal 't' tokens with various numbers. For example, NT10 \u2192 't77', NT1 \u2192 't61', and so on. Each non-terminal seems to produce a terminal when expanded.\n\nLet me list some of the non-terminals and their direct terminals to see a pattern:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t77\n- NT1 \u2192 t61\n- NT6 \u2192 t20\n- NT2 \u2192 t28\n- NT7 \u2192 t66 or t73\n- NT0 \u2192 t66\n- NT31 \u2192 t35, among others.\n\nWait, not all non-terminals produce terminals directly. Some require further expansion. For example, NT22 can produce 't77' or if that's not available, maybe another path? Or perhaps some are defined in a way that only certain terminals are produced.\n\nWait, looking again, each production rule in CNF is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, starting from the start symbol S, I can try to see if the string can be derived by expanding S.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the string starts with NT6 and NT34. Let me check if both of these can produce the first two tokens of the string, which are t28 and t66.\n\nLooking at NT6: the productions are\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n       NT33 NT19\n       NT21 NT25\n       NT6 \u2192 t20\n       NT17 \u2192 t66\n\nWait, so NT6 can produce t20 directly (as in the last line: NT6 \u2192 't20'). So if I take the production NT6 \u2192 t20, then that would correspond to the first token t28. Hmm, but t20 is different from t28. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck the NT6 productions.\n\nLooking back, the NT6 productions are:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 t20\nWait, I think I might have misread the original grammar. Let me look again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is written with multiple lines. Let me recheck the NT6 productions:\n\nNT6:\n- NT27 NT19\n- NT33 NT19\n- NT21 NT25\n- NT17 \u2192 t66 (Wait, no, NT17 is a non-terminal, but looking down, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the actual productions. Let me list all the NT6 productions as per the original grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 ... any others?\n\nWait, looking back, I see lines like:\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT6 \u2192 t20 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I misformatted. Let me try to list them properly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading. Looking through each line:\n\nWait, the production rules for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 \u2192 t66? Or is that another rule?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread NT17. Looking:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t66 and also NT17 \u2192 t73? Let me check NT17's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 -> NT14 NT28\nNT17 -> NT7 NT7\nSo NT17 can produce two non-terminals or two terminals?\n\nWait, no, each production rule is only one line. Wait, looking back:\n\nNT77? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should re-express all the rules clearly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by building a parse tree for the given string. Let's see.\n\nThe string is: t28 t66 t66 t0 t45 t14 t18 t0 t67 t45 t54 t66 t29 t66 t73 t73 t66 t67 t41 t53 t47 t50.\n\nThat's 21 tokens. Let's index them from 0 to 20.\n\nLet me start by trying to match the first symbol. The string starts with t28. So I need to find a production that starts with NT6, as S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nWait, S is the start symbol, which is NT6 followed by NT34. So first, NT6 must produce t28, and NT34 must produce the next token, which is t66.\n\nWait, but looking at NT6's productions, can NT6 directly produce t28? Looking through the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 ... any other ways? I don't see NT6 directly producing t28. So, perhaps the first step is NT6 \u2192 something that eventually produces t28.\n\nWait, looking carefully, perhaps in the NT6 rules, is there a production that leads to t28?\n\nLooking at the NT6 rules as listed in the original grammar:\n\nLooking through each line, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 \u2192 t66\nNT6 -> NT6 \u2192 t20\n\nWait, perhaps that's an error in formatting, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe NT6 \u2192 t20 is one of the productions. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, in the original grammar, the NT6 productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19  \nNT6 -> NT33 NT19  \nNT6 -> NT21 NT25  \nNT6 -> NT17 \u2192 t66  \nNT6 -> NT6 \u2192 t20  \nWait, perhaps each rule is on a new line, so that NT17 is a non-terminal, but when I look below, it says NT17 \u2192 t66 and also has another production:\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's more like:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19  \nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19  \nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25  \nNT6 \u2192 NT17 \u2192 t66  \nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t66  \nNT17 \u2192 t73\n\nSo, NT6 might have a production to NT17, which can produce t66 or t73. But NT6 doesn't directly produce t28, so perhaps I'm thinking of NT6 being expanded into something that leads to t28.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in how the grammar is written. Let's list all the NT6 productions properly:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nLine 1: S -> NT6 NT34\n\nThen:\n\nNT6 is defined as:\n\n1. NT14 NT34 \u2192 probably a mistake, NT6 rules are elsewhere. Let me count all the rules.\n\nHere's a better approach: list all rules where NT6 is on the left side.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- Line 6: NT14 \u2192 NT72\n\n- Line 18: NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n\nWait, that's NT18, not NT6.\n\nLooking carefully, let's find all rules starting with NT6.\n\nLines:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single\u975e terminal symbol producing two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I see S -> NT6 NT34. That means the string starts with NT6 followed by NT34. So, the first word should be whatever NT6 represents.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT6, I see several entries. For example, NT6 can be NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19, etc., down to 't20' or 't80', or other combinations. Each of these represents different ways to expand NT6 into terminal symbols. So I need to see if there's a way to expand NT6 into 't37'.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first word is 't37'. So I'm trying to see if NT6 can produce 't37'. From the NT6 productions, the terminal options are things like 't20', 't28', 't37' (from NT6), 't40' (I'm not sure, maybe 't37' is one of the options?), and 't80'. Oh, I see at the bottom, NT6 has a rule -> 't37'. So yes, NT6 can directly produce 't37'. That's good. So the first part checks out.\n\nNext, after the first word, the second word is 't66'. Looking at the grammar, I need to see how NS transitions to 't66'. Looking at the rules that produce 't66', I see NT7 -> 't66' and NT10 -> 't66', among others. So after NT6 (which is 't37'), the next symbol is 't66', which can come from NT7 or NT10.\n\nBut what's producing the rest? Let's think about how the string is built. The entire string is a sequence of terminals, so each part should come from expanding the appropriate non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nAfter the first two words 't37' and 't66', the next word is 't73'. So I need to see what comes after 't66'. Let's consider that 't66' could be from NT7 or NT10. Looking at the grammar, NT7 has rules like -> NT7 NT7 or other combinations. Wait, I see NT7 -> NT7 NT7, which would give 't66' and 't66' if expanded, but that's not our case. Alternatively, NT7 has a production -> NT1 -> NT14 NT28 or others? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's backtrack. The second symbol is 't66'. So the second symbol comes from expanding the second non-terminal in S's production, which is NT34. So I need to see what NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT34, its production is -> 't3'. So NT34 produces 't3' directly. But our string after the first symbol is 't66', but NT34 is producing 't3'. Wait, that doesn't match. That suggests a problem because the second symbol should be 't66', but the production for NT34 is only 't3'. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I got it wrong. The S production is NT6 NT34. So the first symbol comes from NT6, which can be 't37', and the second comes from NT34, which is 't3'. But the given string after the first word is 't66', so that would mean that the second symbol must come from NT34, which is only 't3'. That doesn't match. So that seems like a contradiction.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Did I get the expansion wrong? Or maybe the string is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted how S is derived. Let me think again.\n\nWait, S is S -> NT6 NT34. So S expands into NT6 followed by NT34. So the first symbol is nt6's expansion, the second is nt34's expansion. Given that the string starts with 't37 t66', that would mean nt6 is 't37' and nt34 is 't66'. Looking at the grammar, nt34 only has one production, which is 't3', so that's a problem because we're expecting 't66' there.\n\nSo that's a critical issue. If nt34 can't produce 't66', then the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread nt34's production. Let me double-check. Looking through the grammar, nt34 -> 't3' is the only rule. So no, there's no rule that allows nt34 to produce 't66'.

I think I might have miscounted, but looking at the list:\n\nSearching for NT6: The string says NT6 has several productions.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT31 NT19\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nLine: NT6 -> NT33 NT17\n\nWait, that's correct. So NT6 has multiple rules, each consisting of two NTs or a mix.\n\nSo, when S \u2192 NT6 NT34, the next step is to split the string accordingly and see if it aligns.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with \"t29 t3...\". So S\u2192 NT6 NT34, which should start with the first symbols being what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, let's see what the first symbol can be. For example, NT6's first rule is NT27 NT19, so the next symbols in the string should start with what NT27 produces.\n\nBut let me think: if the string starts with t29, which is a terminal, I need to find which NT production for NT6 can produce t29 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules, the first symbol is always an NT because all productions are like A\u2192BC.\n\nSo if NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, then NT27's first symbol would be the next in the string.\n\nLooking at NT27's productions:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nSo NT27's production is two NTs, each of which needs to produce something. But the first symbol in the string is t29, so let's see what NT27 can produce. Wait, NT27 is a non-terminal, but if it produces NT7 NT7, then the first symbol would be what NT7 produces.\n\nLooking at NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t66 or t73.\n\nIn the string, we have t29 t3... so that's not matching either. Wait, this can't be right because NT7 is an NT and produces terminals, but if the string starts with t29, which isn't what NT7 can produce, then maybe this path is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the productions. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I should start from the string and try to parse it using the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is: t29 t3 t40 t37 t0 t66 t61 t45 t28 t61 t66 t22 t45 t67 t43 t40 t40 t40 t73 t54 t66 t23 t50.\n\nI'll represent it as a list: [t29, t3, t40, t37, t0, t66, t61, t45, t28, t61, t66, t22, t45, t67, t43, t40, t40, t40, t73, t54, t66, t23, t50].\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first two components of the string should be the start of what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nLet's see NT34's productions:\n\nLooking at NT34: NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17.\n\nSo the first symbol of the string is t29. So we need to see if NT34 can produce a string starting with t29, but NT34 produces two non-terminals, so the first symbol would be the first symbol of NT31 (since NT34 \u2192 NT31 NT17). NT31's first production is NT35 and then something. Wait, but looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, NT31's productions: NT31 \u2192 NT31 NT17 or NT31 \u2192 NT22 NT0 or others.\n\nWait, looking back, I think I'm getting confused. Let me structure this properly.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with NT6 and NT34 producing t29 and t3.\n\nWait, no. S \u2192 NT6 NT34 means the string is the concatenation of what NT6 produces and what NT34 produces. So the string starts with the symbols that NT6 would produce, followed by those that NT34 would produce.\n\nSo looking at the first symbol t29, it must be the first symbol of NT6's expansion. Then, the second symbol t3 must be the first symbol of NT34's expansion.\n\nSo let's see what NT6 can produce as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6\u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6\u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nNT6\u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nNT6\u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6\u2192 NT31 NT19\n\nNT6\u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6\u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6\u2192 NT33 NT17\n\nWait, so the first symbol in NT6's expansion is always another non-terminal. So the first symbol t29 must be the first symbol of an NT, which must come from either NT27, NT33, NT21, NT17, NT31, etc.\n\nLooking at NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7.\n\nSo NT27 produces NT7 followed by NT7. So the first symbol is t7 (but looking at NT7, it can produce t66 or t73).\n\nWait, but t7 isn't in the string. The string's first symbol is t29. So that can't be. So NT27's production starts with a non-terminal, which produces t7, but t7 is not in the string.\n\nSimilarly, let's check NT33: NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17. NT31's first production is NT31 NT17 or nt... So NT31's first symbol is another NT, which could be NT22, etc. NT22\u2192 t45 or t22, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me take it step by step. \n\nFirst, the string is: `t37 t28 t72 t66 t37 t61 t66 t53 t66 t83 t66 t14 t41 t22 t66 t29 t66 t67 t66 t53 t14 t71 t50`.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That helps because each step in the derivation will produce two tokens. \n\nStarting from S, which is `S -> NT6 NT34`. So the first symbol should be from NT6 or NT34. Looking at the string, the first token is t37. Let's see if NT6 or NT34 can start with t37. \n\nLooking at all the productions for NT6, there are several rules where NT6 leads to a terminal. For example, `NT6 -> t27 NT19` and others. Wait, actually, no, NT6 has a production to t66? No, wait: Looking back, I might have misread. \n\nWait, the NT6 production options include `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`, `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`, `NT6 -> t33 NT19`, `NT6 -> NT25 NT51`? Wait, no, looking at the initial grammar list provided, it's quite extensive. I need to check which production for NT6 starts with a terminal that matches the first token. \n\nWait, the string starts with t37. Looking at all the NT6 rules, I don't see any production for NT6 directly going to t37. Let's check: \n\nLooking through NT6 productions, I see `NT6 -> t3?` Maybe not. For example, one production is `NT6 -> NT27 NT19`, another is `NT6 -> t27 NT19`, another `NT6 -> NT21 NT25`, `NT6 -> NT25 NT51`\u2014no, wait, looking back, I think I might have misread the initial grammar. \n\nWait, the user provided a lot of grammar rules. Let me parse the grammar to find possible sequences that can produce t37. Maybe I should list all the productions for NT1 to NT34, along with the terminals where applicable.\n\nWait, let me try to compile all nodes and their possible expansions. \n\nStarting with NT1:\nNT1 -> NT14 NT28\nNT1 also expands to a terminal when needed, like `NT1 -> t61` or `t29` etc.\n\nWait, looking at the NT1 productions: \n\n- NT14 -> NT2 NT1\n- NT14 -> t72\n- Also, NT1 can expand to 't29' or 't47', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it by trying to parse the string from S. Since S is NT6 NT34, and each of these can produce a sequence of terminals. \n\nLet me take the string step by step, treating each token as a terminal. Let's check the first token to see which NT could generate it.\n\nFirst token: t37. So, looking at NT that can produce t37. \n\nLooking through the grammar, do any NTs have a direct terminal of t37? \n\nWait, searching through all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through NT4: `NT4 -> t29`, `NT4 -> t36`, `t39`, etc. Not t37.\n\nNT27: `t72`, `t66`, `t22`, etc. No.\n\nNT17: `t66`, `t54`. No.\n\nNT6: I don't see any direct terminals of t37 in the NT6 productions.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's not directly matching. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, looking again: the string starts with t37. Maybe I should check if any of the NTs can expand to t37 by combining its NTs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should attempt to parse the string backward to see if it can match the grammar. Since the grammar starts with NT6 and NT34, let's see if the string ends with a compatible symbol. \n\nThe last token is t50. Let's see NT34's possible expansions.\n\nLooking through NT34, I see `NT34 -> t3`, `NT33`, `NT35` etc., but the last rule is `NT34 -> t50`. So perhaps NT34 can end with t50 if one of its rules ends with t50. \n\nLooking at NT34's rules, one of them is `NT34 -> t50`. So that might work. So if the last symbol is t50, it can be generated by the rule `NT34 -> t50`. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly, for NT6, which is the first part of S. So the first token is t37. Let's see if NT6 can generate t37. If none of NT6's direct rules produce t37, maybe through a chain of rules.\n\nLooking through NT6's rules, do any of them lead to t37 as part of a chain? \n\nFor example, NT6 can go to several NTs: NT27, NSomething, maybe others. Wait, let's list the NT6 rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT25 NT51 (Wait, no, in the initial grammar, I think it's `NT6 -> NT25 NT51`? Or perhaps other variations.)\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to systematically check possible sequences.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token t37 can come from NT1. Let me check: looking at NT1's rules, is there a production that can end with t37? Let me check.\n\nNT1's rules include:\n\n- NT1 -> NT14 NT28\n- NT14 can produce t72, t61, t28, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Let me think differently. Since the string starts with t37, maybe it's generated by some NT that ends with t37. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be tokenized into a series of NT steps.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a top-down parse, starting with S and trying to match the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which expands into NT6 NT34. Each of these is a non-terminal that must be expanded into a sequence of terminals. So, the first two tokens are generated by NT6 and NT34. \n\nBut in the string, the first two tokens are t37 and t28. So, does NT6 generate t37, and NT34 generate t28?\n\nWait, the first token is t37. So, the first symbol t37 should come from NT6's expansion. Let's see if NT6 can generate t37. \n\nLooking through NT6's rules, I don't see any directly produce t37. So perhaps it's through a chain of productions. Let's see:\n\nNT6 can go to NT27 and NT19. Now, do NT27 and NT19 have any productions that can lead to t37?\n\nWait, looking at NT27's productions: `NT27 -> t72`, `t66`, t22, t73. No t37.\n\nWait, what about NT25? Let's see, NT25 has `t36`, `t49`, `t57`. Not t37.\n\nWait, perhaps this is not possible, meaning the string cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let me go step by step. Maybe there's another way. Let's consider that the entire string must be a leftmost derivation from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check what each NT can produce.\n\nLet's try to model the entire string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t37 t28 t72 t66 t37 t61 t66 t53 t66 t83 t66 t14 ... \n\nSo, first two tokens are t37 and t28. So, from S -> NT6 NT34, NT6 must generate t37 and NT34 must generate t28. Or is that necessarily the case?\n\nWait, no, because the two NTs (NT6 and NT34) can be expanded non-simultaneously. So NT6 may produce a sequence, NT34 another, and their concatenation forms the string.\n\nWait, but each NT in the initial expansion (NT6 and NT34) are themselves non-terminals, so each must generate a sequence of terminals.

Or not, I think NT6 can produce 't20' or 't80' directly because looking at the string, NT6 has several terminal productions. \n\nWait, no, actually, from the user-provided grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking through the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nBut then, looking at the later parts:\n\nWait, I think in the user-provided grammar, among the NTs, NT6 has the following terminal rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\nNT6 \u2192 't80'\nNT6 \u2192 't66'\nWait, let's check the last part: \n\nThe user's grammar entries include:\n\n- NT22 -> 't77'\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT22 -> 't77'\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't29'\n- NT27 -> 't72'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT21 -> 't37'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n- NT18 -> 't22'\n- NT10 -> 't12'\n- NT1 -> 't14'\n- NT11 -> 't11'\n- NT18 -> 't53'\n- NT22 -> 't38'\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT22 -> 't10'\n- NT20 -> 't45'\n- NT17 -> 't40'\n- NT14 -> 't72'\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n- NT6 -> 't80'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me list out all the direct terminal productions from the NT6:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT6 \u2192 't80'\n- NT6 \u2192 't66' (multiple times)\n- NT6 \u2192 't73' (perhaps from NT27? Or another? Wait, NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'. So perhaps in the chain for NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, which becomes (from NT7 \u2192 t66 or t73) and NT19 can produce 't47'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't66 t18 t0 t28 t28 t14 t73 t36 t0 t0 t65 t66 t29 t0 t53 t45 t67 t66 t83 t66 t66 t40 t47 t50'.\n\nLet me break it down piece by piece.\n\n1. The string starts with 't66', so perhaps it's from NT6 \u2192 't66'. Alternatively, could it be from another NT?\n\nLet's first check if t66 can come from NT6. From NT6, 't66' is a possible terminal. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which can both produce t66.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 produces 't66' directly. So let's see.\n\nSo, assuming NT6 is at the root, producing 't66' as one symbol. Then the next part of the string would be 't18', which would have to come from NT34, since S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nWait no, S produces NT6 and NT34, so the first two symbols come from NT6 and NT34. But in the string, the first symbol is 't66', so perhaps NT6 is 't66', then NT34 needs to produce the rest of the string minus 't66'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t66 followed by t18. So if S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is splitting the string into two parts, first part is NT6 and the second part is NT34. But the given string's first token is 't66', so that could be NT6. Then, the second part would need to be 't18 t0 t28 t28 t14 t73 t36 t0 t0 t65 t66 t29 t0 t53 t45 t67 t66 t83 t66 t66 t40 t47 t50', which would need to be satisfied by NT34.\n\nLet me check what NT34 can"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-452","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is broken down into tokens, so I'll start by writing them out:\n\nt37, t66, t65, t0, t14, t45, t68, t40, t40, t45, t61, t3, t22, t66, t72, t18, t66, t11, t45, t11, t41, t53, t23, t3.\n\nI remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol S, which can produce two terminals. Wait, no, CNF typically requires that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So in this grammar, all rules should either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see both types. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is a production that expands into two non-terminals. NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1 is another non-terminal expansion. Some rules like NT6 \u2192 t20 are terminal expansions.\n\nThe string we're checking consists entirely of terminals, so we can try to parse it from left to right using the grammar's productions.\n\nI'll start by looking at the first few tokens. The string starts with t37. I need to check which non-terminals can produce t37. Looking through the terminal productions, I see NT11 \u2192 t11, NT18 \u2192 t18, NT21 \u2192 t21, etc. But wait, I don't see any non-terminals that produce t37. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me scan through the terminal productions again. I see NT21 \u2192 t37. No, NT21 has a production NT21 \u2192 t37 and also NT21 \u2192 t53. Wait no, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT21 \u2192 t37\nNT0 \u2192 t0\n...\nYes, so NT21 can produce t37.\n\nSo the first token is t37, which comes from NT21. Now, the remaining part of the string after this would be:\n\nt66, t65, t0, t14, t45, t68, t40, t40, t45, t61, t3, t22, t66, t72, t18, t66, t11, t45, t11, t41, t53, t23, t3.\n\nWait, no, the first token is t37, so it's the start of the string. So the entire string is the initial symbol, probably S, which leads to NT6 NT34. So let's think about how the string can be generated by expanding S.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT6 NT34. So, the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nNow, the string starts with t37, which is the first part. So we need to see if either NT6 or NT34 can generate t37.\n\nFrom the grammar, looking at NT6 \u2192 t20, and if not, we need to see if NT6 can derive a string that starts with t37. Wait, but in the string provided, t37 is the first token, so the first part of the expansion must be NT21.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So for the first part, we need to see how NT6 and NT34 can produce tokens. But NT6's expansion is, for example, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or other options, or can it produce a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT6 has multiple productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT25\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT37\n\nWait, looking again, there's NT6 \u2192 t20, but also NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, etc. So in our case, the first token is t37, which is produced by NT21, not NT6. So that suggests that perhaps the initial part of the string is not compatible with the grammar, but maybe I need to see how the derivation proceeds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a parse tree, starting from S and seeing if the string can be generated through leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a recursive descent parser or use a chart parser, but given the complexity, I might try to look for possible phrases or patterns.\n\nAlternatively, I can group the string into tokens and see if they can form meaningful sequences given the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the CYK algorithm to see if the string is in the language. Let's try that.\n\nThe CYK algorithm works by building a table where for each position, we look at possible non-terminals that can produce the substring at that position.\n\nFirst, we'll list all the tokens in the string as terminals:\n\n1: t37\n\n2: t66\n\n3: t65\n\n4: t0\n\n5: t14\n\n6: t45\n\n7: t68\n\n8: t40\n\n9: t40\n\n10: t45\n\n11: t61\n\n12: t3\n\n13: t22\n\n14: t66\n\n15: t72\n\n16: t18\n\n17: t66\n\n18: t11\n\n19: t45\n\n20: t11\n\n21: t41\n\n22: t53\n\n23: t23\n\n24: t3\n\nWait, that's 24 tokens. But the string as given in the question seems to have 24 tokens. Let me recount:\n\nThe string is:\n\nt37, t66, t65, t0, t14, t45, t68, t40, t40, t45, t61, t3, t22, t66, t72, t18, t66, t11, t45, t11, t41, t53, t23, t3.\n\nCounting that, it's 24 tokens.\n\nSo, CYK table would be 24 rows and 24 columns.\n\nThe first step is to initialize the table: For each position (i), assign the non-terminals that can directly produce the token at position i.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I'll pick each token and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nt37 \u2192 NT21\n\nt66 \u2192 NT0, NT17, NT2, NT21, NT7, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn the terminals, I see:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t66\n\nNT2 \u2192 t28, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT17 has two productions: NT14 \u2192 t72, etc. Wait no, looking specifically for t66:\n\nLooking at all terminal productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t0\n\n- NT17 \u2192 t66\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t28, but maybe others:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t66? Wait, no, looking through the terminal mappings, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t66 except for NT17.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nNT17 \u2192 t66\n\nSo t66 is produced by NT17.\n\nSimilarly, t72 is produced by NT17 (since NT72 is produced by NT6 \u2192 t72, but that's a terminal. Wait, perhaps I should list all the terminal substitutions:\n\nLet me parse through each rule to see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\nNT21 \u2192 t37, t53\n\nNT0 \u2192 t0\n\nNT14 \u2192 t72\n\nNT22 \u2192 t77, t45, t66 (wait, let's check each:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 NT6 NT19 (so non-terminal)\n\nBut as per terminal productions, looking for rules where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\nLooking through each rule, I see:\n\nNT31 can produce some terminals (e.g., t35, etc.)\n\nBut individually:\n\nLooking through, for example:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 t72\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t0\n\n- NT19 \u2192 t23, t47\n\n- NT27 \u2192 t72, t73\n\nWait, I think I'll need to make a list.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\nEach terminal and which non-terminals produce it.\n\nt0: NT0\n\nt1: Not present as a terminal yet?

{"custom_id":"request-469","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar that's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t0 t66 t66 t66 t29 t73 t29 t66 t83 t45 t73 t66 t45 t14 t41 t53 t73 t29 t66 t11 t3 t53 t14 t81 t3`. That's a pretty long string, so I need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form looks like. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the production rules seem to fit the CNF structure. Each rule either breaks down non-terminals into two non-terminals or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string consists of a series of terminals: t0, t66, t66, and so on. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules.\n\nThe first step is to see how the string might split based on the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the leftmost derivation will split the string from left to right, each step expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals or terminals. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I can't go through each step manually, so I'll look for patterns or specific replacements.\n\nLet me look at some of the terminal symbols and see which non-terminals they correspond to. For example, t0 is produced by NT10, because NT10 -> 't66' and one of the rules is NT10 -> 't12'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, I think I might have to map each terminal to their production rules. Let me go through the given grammar and note where each terminal is produced.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, here are the terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT10 -> 't66' (from NT10 -> 't66')\n- NT10 -> 't12' (from NT10 -> 't12')\n- NT15 -> 't65'\n- NT11 -> 't11'\n- NT18 -> 't22'\n- NT22 -> 't38' (from NT22 -> 't38')\n- NT14 -> 't72'\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73' (from NT7 -> 't73')\n- NT27 -> 't72' (from NT27 -> 't72')\n- NT27 -> 't73' (from NT27 -> 't72' and 't73'? Wait, no, each rule is separate. Looking at NT27, one rule is NT27 -> NT7 NT7, another is NT27 -> 't72'? Wait, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT7 -> 't66'\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nSo NT27 can derive 't72' via NT27 -> 't72' (from one rule NT27 -> 't72'), but wait, no, looking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nHmm, actually, no, the grammar doesn't have NT27 -> 't72' directly. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking for NT27 in the rules:\n\nNT27 appears in:\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT7 -> 't66'\n- NT7 -> 't73'\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. So NT27 is a non-terminal that can produce 't72' how? Because according to the rules provided, there's no production for NT27 that directly gives 't72'. Wait, no, actually in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all rules, I don't see NT27 -> 't72' directly. Instead, I see NT6 -> NT33 NT19 and other rules, but no NT27 -> 't72' in the given grammar. So perhaps I was wrong earlier.\n\nLet me check again. The user provided the list of rules as a long string with each rule separated by a pipe. I'll parse each line to identify the left and right sides.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n\"NT27 -> NT7 NT7\" is one production, and NT7 has two productions: 't66' and 't73'.

{"custom_id":"request-471","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar starts with a single start symbol, usually S, and terminals are at the leaves of the parse tree. So, each production builds up the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first step should be NT6 followed by NT34. But wait, in the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions, so it's probably going to expand into some terminals. \n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is `t28 t61 t73 t39 t0 t66 t65 t0 t66 t66 t29 t0 t29 t66 t54 t66 t66 t12 t45 t54 t50 t54 t84 t47 t3`. That's a lot of tokens, but I can parse them as a sequence of terminals.\n\nTo see if the string is generated by the grammar, I'll try to build the parse tree from the bottom up. Starting with S, which is NT6 NT34. Then each of those non-terminals needs to expand into a sequence that matches the terminals in the string.\n\nLet's start expanding NT6 and NT34 from S. \n\nNT6 has several productions. Looking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 (again)\nWait, actually, I see NT6 has multiple rules. Let me list them:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT25 NT19 (Wait, no, there's another rule NT6-> NT25 NT19 but also another for NT25)\nWait, looking back:\n\nGrammar rules for NT6:\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT25 NT19 (Wait, is that the case? Let me check.)\n\nWait no, in the grammar, it's:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n...\nNT6 -> NT25 NT19\nYes, that's correct. So NT6 has three rules: NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT21 NT25, NT17 NT7, NT25 NT19.\n\nSimilarly, NT34 has a production: NT34 \u2192 't3'. So NT34 is a terminal, which is 't3'. So when S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is expanded, the last token is 't3'.\n\nNow, moving to NT34, which is 't3', so that's the end of that part.\n\nSo the entire string must start with NT6 expanding into a sequence ending with 't3'. But let's think about the entire string. The string is:\n\nt28 t61 t73 t39 t0 t66 t65 t0 t66 t66 t29 t0 t29 t66 t54 t66 t66 t12 t45 t54 t50 t54 t84 t47 t3.\n\nWait, but in the string, 't3' is at the end. Looking back, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which ends with NT34 \u2192 't3', so the last token should be 't3'. But the string ends with 't3', so that's a good start.\n\nNow, focusing on NT6. Let's see what NT6 can expand into. The different productions are:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT25 NT19\n\nNow, each of these can further split into their own production rules, and so on. So I need to find a way to represent the string in terms of these expansions.\n\nBut this might take a while, so let me try to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe first token is 't28'. So look at NT6's possible expansions and see if they can start with 't28'.\n\nLooking at each production rule for NT6:\n\n1. NT27 NT19: What do NT27 and NT19 expand into? Let's check their production rules.\n\nNT27 has rules:\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 't66' NT7 (Wait, no. Looking back:\n\ngrammar for NT7: NT7 \u2192 't66' NT7 and also NT7 \u2192 't73'. Oh wait, the grammar for NT7 is:\n\nNT7 \u2192 t73\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't66' NT7\nNT7 \u2192 't73'\n\nWait, so in NT7, two options: 't73' or 't66 NT7'. So that could be a recursive expansion.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT7 can lead to 't73' or 't66' followed by NT7, which would allow for multiple t66's.\n\nBut in our case, looking at NT27, which has production NT7 NT7.\n\nWait, the productions for NT27 are:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 't66' NT7\n\nWait, no:\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 't66' NT7\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo NT27 can expand into two possibilities: either NT7 NT7 or 't66' NT7.\n\nIf we choose NT7 NT7, then each NT7 can be 't73' or 't66' NT7.\n\nBut this could lead to 't73 t73', or 't66 t73', or 't66 t66 t73', etc.\n\nBut in our string, after 't28', we have 't61 t73...'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me see each step, recursively.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34 \u2192 NT6 t3.\n\nSo the string must start with the expansion of NT6 ending with 't3' at the end.\n\nSo NT6 must generate a string that starts with 't28' (first token) and goes through to the end, which is 't3' at the end.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see all the non-terminals and their possible expansions and see if the tokens can line up.\n\nLooking at the list of terminals in the string:\n\nt28, t61, t73, t39, t0, t66, t65, t0, t66, t66, t29, t0, t29, t66, t54, t66, t66, t12, t45, t54, t50, t54, t84, t47, t3.\n\nSo 25 tokens total.\n\nLet me try to see if NT6 can produce something that starts with t28. Looking at the production rules for NT6:\n\nOption 1: NT27 NT19.\n\nIf NT27 is 't28', how? Let's check NT27's rules.\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, or 't66' NT7.\n\nWait, but 't66' NT7 could lead to t66 followed by another NT7. So that can't directly produce t28. Unless there's a production for t73 leading to t28. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT7 leading to t28. Let me check the grammar for other places.\n\nWait, in the NT11, NT15, etc., do I see any rules leading to t28? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't36' or 't49' or 't57'.\n\nHmm, not t28. So how does t28 come into play?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check NT27. NT27's rules:\n\n- \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- \u2192 't66' NT7\n\nWait, in NT7's rules, 't66' can come from here. So for example:\n\nNT71: Wait, no, that's a different symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-491","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem and the tools I have at my disposal.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars. In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This form is useful because it simplifies the structure, making parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm efficient. However, since the string is provided, and I need to determine membership without necessarily parsing, maybe I can approach it by breaking down the string step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the grammar rules for reference so I can look them up quickly. The start symbol is S. The grammar has a bunch of productions where each non-terminal on the left expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, and so on.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\n`t28 t66 t45 t61 t66 t28 t29 t66 t54 t77 t66 t14 t50 t22 t73 t39 t0 t68 t53 t45 t54 t0 t53 t14 t29 t3`\n\nThat's a long string with 24 tokens.

Let me recount:\nt28, t66, t45, t61, t66, t28, t29, t66, t54, t77, t66, t14, t50, t22, t73, t39, t0, t68, t53, t45, t54, t0, t53, t14, t29, t3. That's 25 tokens, actually.

But perhaps I miscounted. Let me write it as a list:\n\n[\"t28\", \"t66\", \"t45\", \"t61\", \"t66\", \"t28\", \"t29\", \"t66\", \"t54\", \"t77\", \"t66\", \"t14\", \"t50\", \"t22\", \"t73\", \"t39\", \"t0\", \"t68\", \"t53\", \"t45\", \"t54\", \"t0\", \"t53\", \"t14\", \"t29\", \"t3\"]\n\nYes, 25 tokens. Okay, moving on.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to see if it can be produced by the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree will be such that each step involves a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. To parse the string, perhaps we can consider the structure in terms of pairs of symbols, but it's also helpful to see if the string can be broken down into parts matching the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can try to reverse the process: starting from the string and trying to apply inverse productions to see if we can reduce it to the start symbol.\n\nThat might be more manageable because sometimes starting from the beginning is too complex, and reducing helps.\n\nSo let's consider the string as a sequence of symbols, and try to find if there are any production rules that can be applied in reverse, meaning, looking for pairs or terminals that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nFirst, the entire string is:\n\nt28, t66, t45, t61, t66, t28, t29, t66, t54, t77, t66, t14, t50, t22, t73, t39, t0, t68, t53, t45, t54, t0, t53, t14, t29, t3\n\nThis is 25 symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, and the start symbol S produces two non-terminals (since S -> NT6 NT34), the entire derivation tree will result in a string where each node in the parse tree has exactly two children (for each production step), so the total number of terminals in the string is 2^n - 1 for some n. But in this case, 25 is an odd number, which can be represented as 2^5 - 1 = 31, which doesn't fit, but it could still be possible through different production steps. Alternatively, it's not necessarily a full binary tree; some leaves could be terminals resulting from different productions.\n\nBut regardless of that, perhaps the approach is to work backward, starting from the string, trying to find possible splits where a production rule can be applied in reverse.\n\nEach production is of the form Non-terminal1 -> Non-terminal2 Non-terminal3 or Non-terminal1 -> Terminal.\n\nSo in reverse, each terminal in the string must be produced by a production rule that has that terminal on the right-hand side, and the non-terminals must be combined with previous parts of the string.\n\nAlternatively, considering the length of the string, which is 25, starting from the first symbol, I need to see if I can combine symbols using the grammar rules to work towards the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the start symbol production S -> NT6 NT34.

{"custom_id":"request-493","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with production rules, and I have a string to analyze. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The grammar is in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure simplifies parsing because each production directly gives the symbols to generate, without any extra variables or repeated symbols.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a set of productions that recursively define non-terminals leading to terminals. Each non-terminal expands into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which means to get S, we'll need to have NT6 and NT34 in the derived string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t72 t66 t66 t45 t28 t28 t14 t66 t73 t66 t18 t66 t83 t65 t66 t11 t0 t53 t66 t54 t50 t54 t77 t14 t71 t41`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the provided grammar. Each terminal in the string must correspond to the right-hand side of some production rule in the grammar. Let me check each step.\n\nI'll start from the top-level symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first two terminals generated from S should be the results of NT6 and NT34. Looking at the string, the first two symbols are t72 and t66.\n\nWait, let me cross-reference the productions. Looking up NT6 and NT34 to see what they produce. \n\nFrom the grammar, NT6 has two productions:\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t72. Wait, in the grammar, are any of the productions for NT6 directly leading to t72? Let me check:\n\nLooking through NT6's productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19: So NT27 and NT19 are non-terminals. If I follow those, what do they produce?\n\nNT27 has productions:\n1. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n2. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT72\n3. NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT73\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT27 has productions like NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, and others. But in the string, we see a t72. From the grammar, looking at NT27:\n\nFrom the production, NT27 can produce:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT72\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT73\n\nSo, when NT27 is expanded, one of the symbols is a terminal. From the string, the first symbol is t72.\n\nWait, wait, no, the string is not generated by S, but each step is choosing which production to apply.\n\nLet me plan a strategy. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production replaces exactly two symbols with others, but in this case, because the string is given, I can try to see which path in the grammar could lead to each symbol.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to work from the string backward, applying productions in reverse to see if I can derive the string starting from S.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the first production is NT6, which gives us the first symbol, and NT34 gives the next.\n\nWait, no. The string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production. So the string must be constructed by a series of productions, each adding symbols to the left (since top-down parsing builds the string from the start symbol towards the end). Alternatively, working backward might help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree would be clearer, but with such a complex grammar, that might be time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to note what each non-terminal produces as a terminal. Let me see if I can map each non-terminal directly to a terminal, because in a CNF grammar, if a non-terminal directly produces a terminal, it's a leaf in the parse tree. Otherwise, it's an internal node.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production either leads to two non-terminals or a terminal. So for example:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't77' \u2013 directly produces a terminal 't77'.\nNT12 \u2192 't68'\nNT14 \u2192 't72'\nNT15 \u2192 't65'\nNT17 \u2192 't66'\nNT18 \u2192 't22'\nNT19 \u2192 't47' (from the list)\nNT20 \u2192 't45'\nNT21 \u2192 't37' and 't53' etc.\nWait, no: in the grammar, NT21 has multiple productions:\nNT21 \u2192 NT22 NT0 (so non-terminal)\nNT21 \u2192 t37 (from the list: NT21 -> 't37')\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't72', 't66', 't73'?\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n\nFrom the grammar, for example, NT27 has rules:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT72\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT73\n\nSo, if a non-terminal like NT27 is expanded, one of its symbols will be a terminal. So if in the string we have 't72', that comes from NT27 expanding via NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT72. Then the t72 is the third symbol in the string, but wait, let me see the string again.\n\nWait, the given string is:\n\nt72 t66 t66 t45 t28 t28 t14 t66 t73 t66 t18 t66 t83 t65 t66 t11 t0 t53 t66 t54 t50 t54 t77 t14 t71 t41.\n\nLet me try to parse this step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34.\n\nSo the first part is NT6, which can be t72, t66, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at NT6, the productions are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nBut in the grammar, what do these non-terminals produce?\n\nLooking at NT27's rules:\n\nNT27 can produce t72 via NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT72. So if NT27 expands to produce t72 as the second element, that would be the first symbol in the expansion. Wait, no. Wait, in the grammar, NT27 can produce a terminal and a non-terminal. But the problem is that in the string, we're getting a sequence of symbols. So the first symbol in the string is t72, which would have to come from the first element in a production.\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a tree of replacements. Let's consider:\n\nThe string is long, so perhaps there's a repeated structure. Let me see if I can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a pushdown automaton, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, using dynamic programming for parsing might be necessary, but that's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find which non-terminals produce certain terminals.\n\nFor example, from the grammar, several non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT1 \u2192 't29' (Wait, that's a different entry. Wait, looking back.)\n\nWait, let me re-examine the grammar rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the direct terminals:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't77'\n- NT12 \u2192 't68'\n- NT14 \u2192 't72'\n- NT15 \u2192 't65'\n- NT17 \u2192 't66'\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT20 \u2192 't45'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37', 't53', etc. (Wait, for example, NT21 \u2192 't37')\n- NT22 \u2192 't77', 't66', etc.\n- NT24 \u2192 't14'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49', 't57'\n- NT26 \u2192 't80'\n- NT28 \u2192 't20', 't66'\n- NT29 \u2192 't29' (Wait, this might be a typo, but looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at \"NT29-> 't29'\", but that's a direct production to itself, which seems like a loop. That could be problematic because it would create an infinite loop if not handled correctly.

Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing manageable.\n\nLooking at the start symbol, S. The only rule for S is S -> NT6 NT34. So, the start string should be composed of the terminals from NT6 and NT34. Let me write down what each of those NTs produce.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT6 has two rules: NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> t20. So, when we derive NT6, it can either become a combination of NT27 and NT19, which are further non-terminals, or just 't20'. Similarly, NT34 has two rules: NT34 -> t3 or NT34 -> NT2 NT1.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t28. NT6 is the first, right? So, in the initial expansion, S expands to NT6 NT34, so the initial terminals should be the results of NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut let's see: NT6 can produce t20 or NT27 NT19. The string starts with t28, but NT6 can't produce t28 directly because in NT6 rules, the only terminal is t20. So maybe NT6 isn't the starting point here. Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the string starts with t28, but NT6 can only produce t20 or NT27 NT19. So how does t28 get there? That seems like a problem because NT6 shouldn't produce t28. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the entire string and see how the non-terminals could have generated it. Let me try to parse the string step by step, starting from S, which is the start symbol, and see if I can derive the string.\n\nThe string is: t28 t37 t72 t65 t66 t0 t73 t29 t66 t61 t66 t54 t84 t66 t54 t66 t73 t66 t66 t67 t66 t54 t50 t53 t14 t29 t41.\n\nWait, this is a linear string of terminals, but in a derivation, non-terminals (NTs) split into their components. So maybe I need to see if the entire string can be covered by a leftmost derivation or something.\n\nStarting from S -> NT6 NT34. So, the first step is to split S into NT6 and NT34. Now, NT6 and NT34 are both non-terminals. Each will be expanded into a sequence, and their concatenation should form the string.\n\nLet's look at NT6: the rules are NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> t20. Since the string starts with t28, which is not 't20', so NT6 must expand into NT27 NT19. So NT6 becomes NT27 NT19.\n\nNow, NT27 can expand into what? From the rules, NT27 -> NT7 NT7 or NT27 -> t7. In our case, the string is starting with t28, but NT27's possible symbols don't include t28. Wait, that's conflicting. Because NT27 can be t7 or NT7 NT7. But t28 isn't among those options. So how is t28 appearing here?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the NTs and their terminals. Let me re-examine the given rules.\n\nLooking at NT27: The rules are NT27 -> NT7 NT7 or NT27 -> t7. So NT27 can only produce either 't7' or combinations of NT7s.\n\nThe string starts with t28, which isn't produced by NT27. So how does that happen? This suggests that perhaps my initial approach is incorrect, or maybe the grammar can't produce this string. But the user is asking me to evaluate whether the grammar can generate this string, so it's either yes or no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misassigning which NTs are generated where. Wait, perhaps NT0 is being used somewhere. Let me look at NT0 rules.\n\nNT0: the rule is NT0 -> 't66'. So, t66 is a terminal produced by NT0. But in the string, we have t66 several times, which might align with NT0.\n\nWait, but back to the initial step. S expands to NT6 NT34. NT6 is NT27 NT19 because that's the only terminal it can give right now. Since the string starts with t28, and NT27 can't produce t28, I'm stuck here. This might mean the string can't be generated, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT6 can expand further into NT27 and NT19, and then each of those can be expanded into NTs until all terminals are consumed. But wait, each NT produces either more NTs or terminals. So maybe I should try to build the entire tree step by step.\n\nBut the problem is that in the string, the first symbol is t28, but NT6 can't produce t28. So perhaps the string is not generated by the grammar, because it starts with a terminal that isn't an option for NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking at the rules. Let me check all the rules again for NT6.\n\nLooking at NT6's rules: NT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT6 -> t20.\n\nYes, so NT6 directly can't produce t28, only t20. So, the string starts with t28, which isn't possible. Therefore, the answer should be No, the string isn't generated.\n\nWait, but let me verify this once more. If the string starts with t28, and NT6 is the first component of S, which is the start symbol, then indeed, NT6 should generate the first part.

I've never done this before, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means that all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. That should help because each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, which will correspond to a single token in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol and the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the starting string will derive from these two non-terminals.\n\nNow, let's look at the string. It starts with t28 followed by t37. I need to see if these correspond to any production rules that can be derived step by step.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see NT6 has productions like NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, etc. Also, NT6 is directly replaced by 't20' in some cases, but not in the beginning. Since the string starts with t28, which is a terminal, I need to see which non-terminal it's derived from.\n\nLooking at the NT6 production, I see that NT6 has a production to 't20' as well as others. Wait, the initial productions for NT6 are:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT22\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT29\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT57\nWait, maybe I need to double-check. The provided grammar has:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19,\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19,\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25,\nNT6 -> NT34 NT22,\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7,\nNT6 -> NT21 NT29,\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19,\nNT6 -> NT21 NT57\nWait, that might be a typo, but assuming each line is a production, perhaps some duplicates.\n\nSo, the key point is that NT6 can produce various combinations of two non-terminals or some terminals. Now, the string starts with 't28 t37'. Let me see what non-terminals could produce t28 and t37.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't72' (twice)\n- NT4 \u2192 't29\nNT25 \u2192 't49', 't57'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37'\n\nWait, looking at NT21's productions:\nNT21 \u2192 NT7 NT7, NT12 NT18, NT27 NT12, NT28 (no, only 't37'), NT21 NT29, NT24 NT14\n\nWait, the rule is NT21 \u2192 't37'. Yes, in the list, under NT21: `NT21 -> t37`. So NT21 directly produces t37.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT28's productions: under NT28 -> 't18'. But in our string, the second token is t37, which is directly produced by NT21.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t28 followed by t37, which suggests that perhaps the first production was S \u2192 NT6 NT34, and then NT34 produces t37, or maybe NT6 produces t28 and another non-terminal produces t37.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, it starts with t28. So the first token is t28. Since the only way to get t28 is through NT28 -> 't18', but t28 is a different terminal. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the grammar for any production that gives 't28'.\n\nIn the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT28 -> 't18', which is different. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, looking back, the NT28 rule is:\nNT28 -> NT20 NT11\nAnd further productions:\nNT20 -> NT45 (wait, 't45')\nWait, let me see the exact rules provided:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT22 -> 't72'\n- NT4 -> 't29'\n- NT21 -> 't37'\n- NT11 -> 't12'\n- NT18 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT7 -> 't66' (twice)\n- NT27 -> 't72'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT17 -> 't66'\n- NT14 -> 't72'\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n- NT33 -> 't55'\n- NT22 -> 't10' (under NT22 again: NT22 -> NT10)\nWait, but I'm getting confused because in the provided grammar, some NT22 rules are duplicated. For example:\n\nNT22: \n-> NT6 NT15,\n-> NT4 NT15,\n-> NT19,\n-> NT77 (probably a typo, maybe 't77' as in the list),\n-> NT7 (maybe 't7'),\n-> NT22 -> 't77'\nWait, perhaps some rules are duplicated, but the important thing is that NT22 has two rules that directly produce terminals: 't77' and possibly 't10'. But looking at the list, I see:\n\nNT22 has:\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19,\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15,\nNT22 -> NT19,\nNT22 -> NT72,\nNT22 -> NT77,\nNT22 -> NT72,\nNT22 -> NT22 NT25,\nWait, maybe I'm misparsing.\n\nLooking back, the user provided the grammar with multiple entries, some possibly duplicated. For example, under NT22:\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\nNT22 -> NT19\nNT22 -> NT72\nNT22 -> NT77\nNT22 -> NT22 NT25\nNT22 -> NT20 NT65 (Wait, no, that's incorrect. Looking at the user input, it's \"NT22 -> NT10\", which might be 't10', but I need to parse correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's grammar has some NT22 rules as NT22 -> NT10 (which would be a production producing t12, but actually, looking at the rule, under NT10: NT10 -> 't12'. So NT22 -> NT10 would produce 't12'.\n\nBut I'm getting tangled up. Let me try to find which non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nThe string starts with t28 followed by t37.\n\nSo first, I need a production that produces t28, then the next part would be t37.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't28'. Wait, checking all non-terminals, I see:\n\n- NT18 \u2192 't22'\n- NT21 \u2192 't37'\n- NT25 \u2192 't49', 't57'\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT10 \u2192 't12', 't84'\n- NT1 \u2192 't61', 't29'\n- NT7 \u2192 't66', 't73'\n- NT27 \u2192 't72', 't12'\nHmm, I don't see any production that directly gives 't28'. So perhaps the first token t28 must be produced by a production that eventually reduces.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a long derivation. Let me think of the overall approach: the string starts with t28 and t37. So let's think: what non-terminals can produce t37.\n\nFrom the rules, NT21 -> 't37', so one of the non-terminals in the derivation would need to expand to NT21, which then produces 't37'.\n\nBut how to get t28?

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC where B and C are non-terminals, except maybe the start symbol which can go directly to terminals. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see that all productions are for non-terminals, and some of them resolve to terminals, like S->NT6 NT34, but then each of those NTs eventually go to their respective terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so I think the idea is to see if the entire string can be produced by the grammar, starting from S and expanding without any leftover symbols.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into parts. It has 30 tokens, so I need to see how many steps the parser would take. Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, the length of the string should be 2^(n) - 1 for some n, but let's count: 30 is 2^5 -1 =31? No, 2^5 is 32, so 31 tokens. But the string is 30, which doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the initial step adds two, then each step adds two again. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of symbols (non-terminals and terminals) doubles each time. The initial S expands to two non-terminals, then each of those expand, etc. So for a string of length L, the number of steps would be such that the depth of the parse tree is log2(L+1). But 30 isn't a power of 2. Wait, 2^5=32, 2^5-1=31, which is close but not exactly the case here.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production is a binary split, so the total number of symbols at each step doubles. Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, after the first expansion, you have two. Then each of those can split, so four, then eight, etc. But the string has 30, which isn't a power of two. So that might be a hint that it's not possible.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 2^k -1 would give 1,3,7,15,31,... So 31 is the next after 15, but the string has 30 tokens, which is one less than 31. Hmm, but maybe the initial S expands to two non-terminals, and each step doubles the number of symbols. So for the string length, we need 31 tokens for a fully expanded parse tree's leaves. But our string is 30 tokens. So unless the last production results in a single terminal, but 30 can't be formed by 2^k -1. Therefore, maybe it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my reasoning is wrong because maybe the grammar starts with S and each production adds one, but I'm not sure. Let me check another approach.\n\nAnother way is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe string is: t66 t18 t0 t37 t28 t29 t66 t0 t45 t14 t0 t66 t12 t66 t11 t18 t66 t28 t29 t0 t54 t84 t66 t11 t0 t22 t23 t3.\n\nSo, the first token is t66. Let's see what can produce 't66'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 -> 't66' and S->NT6 NT34, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, let's list all the productions that produce 't66':\n\n- NT0 -> t66\n- NT7 -> t66\n- NT17 -> t66 (twice, once under NT17 and under NT22: wait, actually, looking:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for where 't66' is produced. Scanning the list:\n\n- NT0 -> t66\n- NT7 -> t66\n- NT17 -> t66 (appears in two places: NT17 -> NT10 NT0 and NT17 -> t66)\n- NT22 also has NT17 -> t66 (I think, let me check: the list has NT22 -> t38 earlier, but also elsewhere it's NT22 productions like NT22->NT10 NT2, etc. Wait, looking specifically for 't66' as a production:\n\nWait, the given rules include:\n\n- NT10 -> t12 (under NT10 productions)\n- NT17 -> t66\n- NT7 -> t66\n- NT0 -> t66\n- Are there any others? Let's scan the production list again.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nNT7 -> t66 (twice, once under NT7 and NT22)\nNT17 -> t66\nNT0 -> t66\n\nWait, no other terminals match 't66' except those three places.\n\nSo, 't66' can come from NT0, NT7, or NT17.\n\nThe first token is t66, so perhaps starting with NT0. So NT0 can produce 't66', so we can break down t66 as NT0.\n\nNow, to model this, in the parse tree, S might need to produce something that includes NT0, but it's easier to step through the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this as a top-down parse, starting from S and applying rules step by step.\n\nBut handling all this step by step could take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can find if the entire string can be broken down using the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of expansions and see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps a better approach is to simulate a leftmost derivation, seeing if the string can be derived.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, perhaps I can find patterns or known sequences in the grammar that can form parts of the string.\n\nLooking for 't66' multiple times, especially at the beginning and towards the end. The string starts with t66 and ends with t3, which is produced by NT3, and NT3 via several rules.\n\nWait, looking for more 't66's: it appears multiple times. Let me count how many 't66's are in the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t66\n8. t37\n9. t66\n13. t14\n15. t18\n17. t66\n... and so on. Wait, I think 't66' occurs frequently, which might suggest that it's a productive sequence.\n\nBut given the initial token is t66, let's assume it's produced by NT0. So starting with NT0.\n\nBut NT0 -> 't66', so that's the first symbol.\n\nThen, after t66, the next token is t18.\n\nSo perhaps after the initial t66, there's a non-terminal that produces t18.\n\nBut t18 is a terminal, so perhaps the production leading to t18 is a single step. Let's see.\n\nLooking for where t18 is produced:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT18 has a production:\n\nWait, I think I see:\n\n- NT18 -> t22 (under NT18)\n- NT18 also has a production: NT18 -> NT17 NT10\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, yes, I see:\n\n- NT18 -> t22\n- NT18 -> NT17 NT10\n\nSo, t18 can be either 't22' or come from NT17 and NT10.\n\nIn the string, the third token after t66 is t0, so maybe that's another NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model the entire string as a production of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is constructed by expanding S and seeing if it can generate all these terminals without any leftovers.\n\nAnother thought: since each production in CNF splits into two, the number of symbols generated by S should be a power of 2 plus one? Not sure.\n\nWait, the number of symbols in the string is 30. Let me think: Starting with S, each production step can split into two non-terminals, so the number of symbols (including both non-terminals and terminals) increases by one each time?

{"custom_id":"request-524","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are given, and I need to figure out step by step whether the string is part of the language defined by this grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. This helps because it simplifies the parsing process, usually allowing for the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not coding, I'll just try to parse the string manually.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems quite extensive, with many non-terminals that directly produce terminals (like 't28', 't14', etc.) or combinations of non-terminals. The start symbol is S, but in the grammar, I notice that S is not present. Hmm, that's odd. In CNF, the start symbol is usually the left-hand side of the productions, but here, all productions start with NT followed by two non-terminals. So the start symbol is likely 'S', but in the given productions, S is written as NT in some forms. Wait, in the input, the first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing because S is usually the start symbol, but in the productions given, it's written as \"S -> NT6 NT34\". Maybe that's a typo, and perhaps it's supposed to be NT? Or maybe S is another non-terminal. Wait, no, usually in CNF, the start symbol is the only non-terminal at the top level. But here, the grammar's first production is S, so maybe that's the start symbol. But looking at the grammar, all other non-terminals start with NT, like NT14, NT20, etc. So perhaps the start symbol is S, and it's expanded into NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut wait, let me check the grammar again. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So S is expanding into two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals (NT6, NT14, etc.) have their own productions.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals: `t28 t14 t65 t0 t61 t50 t40 t28 t61 t36 t66 t36 t66 t66 t45 t73 t73 t18 t66 t68 t53 t45 t54 t3 t22 t14 t81 t50`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, each step either combines two symbols into one or replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So, starting from S, which produces NT6 and NT34, then each of those can produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut since the string starts with t28, I need to see if any of the productions for NT6, NT34, etc., can produce t28. Looking at the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal, and I see that NT2 -> NT0 NT20, but I also see NT22 -> 't77', which doesn't help. Wait, more importantly, looking for NT that produce t28.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT28 -> NT20 NT11\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT20\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT15 -> NT7 NT4\n- NT27 -> NT12 NT18\n- NT18 -> NT17 NT10\n- NT10 -> 't77', 't12', 't14', etc.\n\nWait, let me check all NT productions that lead to terminals to see where t28 comes from. Hmm, actually, in the provided grammar, I see NT28 is defined as NT20 NT11, but it's possible that I might have missed a production leading directly to t28. Let me go through each NT rule:\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps some NTs directly produce 't28'. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nLooking at the provided rules, under NTs, I don't see any rule that directly produce t28. Wait, perhaps through concatenation of multiple steps. Maybe I need to look recursively.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider that each production in CNF can only have two symbols at each step, so the string must be a result of expanding each non-terminal down until we reach the terminals.\n\nGiven the string, which is a long sequence of t's and numbers, I'll need to see if this can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed using the grammar, step by step.\n\nBut this seems complex without an algorithm, so maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be constructed through the available rules.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t28, t14, t65, etc.\n\nFirst, t28: We need to find a production that expands to t28. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produce t28, but perhaps through two steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be constructed by expanding S step by step.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT6 NT34, then each of NT6 and NT34 can be further expanded.\n\nLet's see what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nNT6: The grammar shows several rules for NT6:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20 (cyclic, not immediately useful)\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT80 (Wait, no, looking back: NT6 entries are under NT6, but I think I confused the numbering.)\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, here's the breakdown:\n\nNT6 appears in multiple productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (another occurrence, maybe a typo)\n- Other NT6 entries are under NT2, NT4, etc., so perhaps NT6 is defined multiple times, but I think the correct one is the first line.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar has multiple productions for the same NT, but with different right-hand sides. So each NT can have several production options.\n\nSo for NT6, possible options are:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25 (Wait, is this a separate production or a repeat?)\n\nActually, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nHere's the exact list:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNT20 -> NT15 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT1 NT34\n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT11 -> NT27 NT28\n\nNT10 -> NT14 NT31\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT7\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT1 -> NT14 NT28\n\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nNT22 -> NT4 NT15\n\nNT33 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\n\nNT15 -> NT7 NT4\n\nNT27 -> NT12 NT18\n\nNT28 -> NT20 NT11\n\nNT2 -> NT0 NT20\n\nNT21 -> NT81\n\nNT0 -> 't66'\n\nNT17 -> 't66'\n\nNT18 -> 't22'\n\nNT10 -> 't12'\n\nNT1 -> 't14'\n\nNT11 -> 't11'\n\nNT18 -> 't53'\n\nNT22 -> 't38'\n\nNT34 -> 't3'\n\nNT33 -> 't55'\n\nNT22 -> 't10'\n\nNT20 -> 't45'\n\nNT17 -> 't40'\n\nNT14 -> 't72'\n\nNT7 -> 't66'\n\nNT7 -> 't73'\n\nNT6 -> 't80'\n\nNT2 -> 't28'\n\nNT21 -> 't81'\n\nNT21 -> 't29'\n\nNT4 -> 't36'\n\nNT25 -> 't49'\n\nNT25 -> 't57'\n\nNT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-536","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t28 t28 t37 t29 t18 t66 t11 t45 t72 t65 t0 t72 t0 t22 t66 t54 t66 t54 t66 t45 t61 t39 t73 t36 t0 t66 t66 t47 t41`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way to write context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is useful for parsing and for certain algorithms that check if a string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in CNF because all the rules start with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT6 NT34 is a rule where S is a non-terminal, and NT6 and NT34 are non-terminals. There are also rules like NT10 \u2192 't77' which are terminal productions.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals (like t28, t29, etc.). Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation must split a non-terminal into exactly two symbols. This means that the string must have a length that's compatible with the number of steps, but for a string of a certain length, each non-terminal must correspond to a specific part of the string.\n\nI think the key is to parse the string step by step using the grammar and see if it can be derived. Alternatively, I can try to build a parse tree that matches the string. But since the string is quite long, it's going to be tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be split into pairs of terminals that correspond to the productions. Each production in the grammar can produce either two non-terminals or one terminal. So starting from the initial symbol S, which can produce NT6 and NT34, we can then check the string in two parts.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't28', but the initial rule S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, in the first step, S becomes NT6 NT34. Then each of these non-terminals will produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first part is 't28 t28', which could correspond to two terminals. So perhaps each 't28' is produced by a non-terminal.\n\nLet me check if 't28' is a terminal and is defined by any rule. Looking at the grammar, I see there's a rule NT27 \u2192 't72' and NT21 \u2192 't37', but also NT6 \u2192 't20', etc. Wait, I need to check the rules for all NTs that might produce 't28' is not listed in the production rules provided.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't20'\n- NT1 \u2192 't61'\n- NT6 \u2192 't21' in some rules?\nWait, the grammar has multiple rules for NT6.

{"custom_id":"request-538","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the given string is generated by this grammar. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't66', 't45', etc.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In this grammar, the non-terminals are things like S, NT14, NT20, etc., and the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, and the production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first step is to generate strings that consist of the concatenation of two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals will then be expanded further according to their production rules.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals have productions that include terminals, like NT10 \u2192 't77', NT15 \u2192 't65', and others. These are the base cases where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol.\n\nThe given string starts with 't66 t45 t66 t73 t29 ...'. Let me think about how this could be generated. The starting symbol S produces NT6 NT34. Let's break down NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions: NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25, NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7, and NT6 \u2192 't20'. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 't3'. So, S would generate something like (NT6)(t3). But wait, that doesn't make sense because S is NT6 followed by NT34, which is 't3'. So the first part of the string should start with 't3', but the given string starts with 't66'. Hmm, that might suggest that my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. Let's see, the string starts with 't66', which is one of the terminals. Let me look for which non-terminal can directly produce 't66'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't76' but in the given string, the first 't66' is there. Wait, in the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't66' is a production. So that's how 't66' can be generated.\n\nBut wait, NT0's production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so to get 't66', that would require one of the NT6 or NT34 steps to produce 't66', but NT34 directly is 't3', so it can't produce 't66'. So NT6 must somehow produce a path that ends with 't66'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6: NT6 can go to NT27 NT19, NT33 NT19, NT21 NT25, NT17 NT7, or 't20'. So, if one of those paths eventually produces a terminal symbol, perhaps that's where 't66' comes from.\n\nBut wait, for NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, we have to expand both. Let me check NT27: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT21 NT21 or others.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs have multiple productions. For example, NT7 can be 't76' and also produce 't66'. Looking back, yes, in the productions, NT7 \u2192 't66' and NT7 \u2192 't73'. So NT7 can produce 't66' directly.\n\nSo if NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, then expanding that would give 't66 t66' because both NT7s produce 't66'. However, in the string given, the first 't66' is followed by 't45', which is another terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the entire string is a combination of these expansions. Let me try to map this. Let's see the string: t66 t45 t66 t73 t29 t66 t72 t45 ... etc.\n\nWait, the first 't66' could come from NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and then NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, so that's 't66 t66'. But the string starts with t66 followed by t45, so that would imply that after the first t66, it's followed by another t45. But according to this, NT27 would produce 't66 t66', not interleaved with other symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT6 is expanded in a different way. Wait, maybe I should look at the entire string and see if it can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to build a parse tree for the given string and see if it adheres to the grammar.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree would be a binary tree where each non-terminal node has exactly two children. The leaves of the tree would be the terminal symbols.\n\nSo the string given is: t66 t45 t66 t73 t29 t66 t72 t45 t66 t66 t45 t67 t45 t54 t45 t68 t22 t65 t66 t66 t73 t66 t67 t41 t54 t72 t35 t47 t50.\n\nSo, the length is 30 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step doubles the number of symbols, but when you have a tree, the total number of leaves is 2^n where n is the depth, but since the grammar can have multiple branches, maybe it's not a straight binary expansion.\n\nBut perhaps starting with S, which is two non-terminals: NT6 and NT34. So the first step is to split the string into two parts corresponding to NT6 and NT34. But since the string is 30 symbols, which is even, but both NT6 and NT34 produce sequences, perhaps we can split the string into two equal parts? Not necessarily, because NT6 and NT34 can produce different lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should look for possible splits where the string is split into two parts, each being a possible expansion of NT6 and NT34. The problem is that without knowing the split, it's tricky. Maybe using lookaheads or trying possible splits.\n\nLet me consider the first symbol, t66. So, either NT6 or NT34 could produce this. But NT34 directly is 't3', not 't66', so it must be NT6 that produces t66. So the first part is NT6, which could generate t66, and the second part is NT34, which is t3. Wait, but the second part of the string starts with t45 after the first 't66', so that would not fit.\n\nWait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated by replacing each non-terminal with their symbols recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to map the tokens of the string into possible productions.\n\nLet's see. The string starts with t66. The non-terminals that can produce t66 are NT0 and NT7. Let's see: NT0 \u2192 t66, and NT7 \u2192 t66 or t73.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which in the string would have two parts: something starts with t66 and something else that starts with the rest.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to approach it recursively. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst symbol is t66. So, it must come from a production of a non-terminal. Possible non-terminals that produce t66 are NT0 and NT7.\n\nIf it's NT0, then we look for a production for NT0, which is S followed by 't0', but wait, in the grammar, S is not involved here because we're expanding NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: The entire string is the result of expanding S, which is NT6 NT34. So, the first part is generated by NT6 and the second part by NT34.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is whatever NT6 generates, followed by whatever NT34 generates.\n\nLooking at the string: t66 t45 t66 t73 t29 ... The first part of the string may end where NT6 expansion ends, and the rest would be NT34's expansion.\n\nBut NT34's only production is 't3', right? Because looking at the grammar, NT34 \u2192 't3'. So the second part of the string should start with t3. But the given string starts with t66 followed by t45,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-549","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

Looking at the grammar, all productions are in CNF because each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by this grammar, I can reconstruct the derivation steps starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string. Alternatively, since the grammar can be large, maybe it's easier to parse the string by going backwards, reconstructing a parse tree from the string to see if the root is S.\n\nWait, another approach is to build a top-down parser or a bottom-up parser (like the shift-reduce parser) for the grammar and see if the string can be accepted. But since this grammar is given and the string is long, perhaps the best approach is to see if each symbol in the string is a terminal and can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me also note that each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So each step in the derivation increases the length by one. Since the grammar is left- and right-heavy, but in CNF, the structure is tree-like.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a recursive descent approach can work. Starting from the start symbol S, which produces NT6 and NT34. So the string must start with the symbols produced by NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't37'. I need to check if any production of NT6 or NT34 can lead to 't37'. Let me look at the productions for NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has several productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 (again)\n6. NT6 \u2192 NT1 (from the last set)\n7. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19 (repeated)\nWait, looking more closely, the grammar has:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT1 \u2192 't20'\nNT6 -> NT1 \u2192 't20'\n\nWait, no, looking again, the lines where NT6 \u2192 't20' are after the non-terminals. So NT6 has a production where it directly produces 't20'. Similarly, other non-terminals have productions to specific terminals.\n\nSo, looking at the first token 't37', which non-terminal can produce it directly? Looking through the terminal assignments:\n\nLooking at NT27: it can produce 't72' and 't73'.\nNT4: 't29'\nNT21: 't37'\nWait, yes! NT21 has a production NT21 \u2192 't37'. Oh, that's important.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT21 is a non-terminal. Let's check: yes, in the productions, NT21 is listed with a production to 't37'. So for the first token 't37', it can be produced directly by NT21.\n\nSo the string starts with 't37', which is the production of NT21. Now, looking at where NT21 appears in the grammar, NT21 can only produce 't37', so NT21 must be one of the non-terminals that directly produce that token.\n\nSo the first step is that the string starts with NT21 \u2192 't37'. Now, looking at how NT21 is derived, it's a production that is part of a larger production. Wait, no, NT21 is a non-terminal that can only produce 't37' directly because looking at all productions, I don't see NT21 having more complex productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the only production for NT21 is NT21 \u2192 't37'. So it's a terminal production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, NT21 appears in multiple productions as the left-hand side. Let me check the full list again:\n\nNT21: NT21 \u2192 't81', NT21 \u2192 't29', NT21 \u2192 't37'. So there are three productions:\n\n1. NT21 \u2192 t81\n2. NT21 \u2192 t29\n3. NT21 \u2192 t37\n\nSo yes, it can directly produce any of those terminals, not just t37.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. So for the string, starting with t37, that can come from NT21. So our first step is:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\n\nThen, from NT6 and NT34, we start building the string. But let's focus on the string: first token is t37. So perhaps the first production is S \u2192 NT21 NT34? Wait, no, S produces NT6 and NT34. But NT6 can produce t37, so the first token must come from NT6.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me detail the process step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of tokens. Each token must match a production from a non-terminal, and that production must be part of the grammar.\n\nSo the string starts with 't37', so we look for a production that directly produces 't37'. Looking at the terminals:\n\n- NT21 produces t37.\n\nSo perhaps the first token comes from NT21. Therefore, in the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so perhaps NT6 is the one that produces 't37' via its terminal productions? Or maybe the 't37' comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. Let me consider that the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the entire string must be built as the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut to process 't37 t72 t45 ...', perhaps each non-terminal starts some part of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as the string being generated as a leftmost derivation. Let's consider that:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So we have two parts, A and B, where A is derived from NT6 and B from NT34.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first part must be generated by NT6, which starts with 't37', which is from NT21. So perhaps NT6 contributes the first few symbols, and NT34 contributes the rest.\n\nThis might get complicated. Maybe another approach is to reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each non-terminal is a node, and in CNF, the tree is full, each node has either two children (if it's a non-terminal) or no children (if it's a terminal).\n\nSo let's consider building the parse tree root as S, which must have two children: the first from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nThe string is about 30 tokens long, so the tree will be 30 levels deep, which is possible but not trivial to draw. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if each token can be generated by the non-terminals and if the overall structure is possible.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for the end tokens. The last token is 't77', which is a terminal. So the last part of the string must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't77'. Looking at the grammar, 't77' is produced by NT22 and CT22? Wait, the grammar entries:\n\nLooking at all the productions that have 't77':\n\n- NT7: NT7 \u2192 t72, t73\n- NT6: NT6 \u2192 t20, etc., but I think the productions for NT7 are:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see NT7 directly producing t77. Wait, but:\n\nLooking again, under the productions:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t66 (twice)\n- NT7 also produces t73.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing where t77 is produced. Wait, I need to check all the productions.

{"custom_id":"request-561","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is structured as each production rule having two non-terminal symbols on the left or a single terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided grammar and the string in question. The string is a sequence of tokens, each presumably corresponding to terminals in the grammar. The goal is to see if there's a derivation path using the given production rules that ultimately produces this string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many non-terminal symbols (NT1 to NT34) have productions that lead to terminals. Some non-terminals produce other non-terminals, which then might produce terminals. For example, S -> NT6 NT34, which means S can be rewritten into two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. Each of these can potentially be expanded further or be terminals themselves.\n\nNow, the string is a series of t's followed by numbers. I need to see if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Let's break down the string:\n\n`t28 t66 t66 t0 t66 t29 t65 t66 t67 t45 t29 t3 t22 t65 t66 t73 t73 t18 t0 t66 t66 t66 t72 t73 t39 t66 t67 t0 t22 t47 t50`\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so I'll need to see if these can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which is the start symbol. S can be rewritten to NT6 and NT34. So, the first step is that S -> NT6 NT34.\n\nNext, each NT6 and NT34 will be expanded. Let's look at NT6: expanding NT6, I see it can go to NT27 NT19 or other variations. But in the string, the first token is t28. So I need to see if NT6 can derive t28.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6, I see NT6 -> NT27 NT19, NT6 -> NT33 NT19, and NT6 -> NT21 NT25. Also, NT6 has some other productions leading to terminals. Wait, actually, some of the NT6 entries have different paths. For example, some say NT6 -> 't20', others 't66', 't80', etc. But wait, I think I might be misinterpreting the table.\n\nWait, no. The grammar provided is a list where each line is a production. For example, the first line is `S -> NT6 NT34`. Then each NTX line has its own productions. So for NT6, looking at the grammar, I see several production rules leading to NTs and some also directly to terminals. For example, `NT6 -> 't20'` and `NT6 -> 't33 NT19'` etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar is structured as each NT followed by a rule. So for example, after S, we have NT14, NT20, etc. Each of these NTs have their own production rules. For NT6, the entries under it in the grammar are:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT80\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\nWait, perhaps I need to be more precise. Let me list the productions for each NT6.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT80\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nWait, perhaps I see different rules. Wait, no: looking more carefully, the NT6 lines are:\n\nLine 2: NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nLine 7: NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n\nLine 16: NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nLine 36: NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n\nLine 46: NT6 -> NT80\n\nHmm, perhaps each line corresponds to a production. So, the productions for NT6 are:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\n2. NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n\n3. NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n\n4. NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n\n5. NT6 \u2192 NT80\n\nWait, I'm not sure because sometimes the strings might be cut off or overlapping. But in any case, to get the first token t28, perhaps the initial NT6 or NT34 needs to expand to a terminal like t28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, does any NT produce t28 directly? Let's check all the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the NTs, I see:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't72' (from row 71: NT27 -> 't72')\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't29'\n\n- NT21 \u2192 't37' (row 30: NT21 -> 't37')\n\n- NT17 \u2192 't73' (row 5: NT17 -> 't73')\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't81' (row 25: NT22 -> 't81')\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't66'\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n\n- NT33 -> 't30'\n\n- NT34 -> 't3'\n\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't22'\n\nWait, looking specifically, under NT28: the line is 'NT28 -> NT20 NT11' but also, looking further, I see lines like:\n\nLine 37: NT10 -> 't84'\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, looking for NTs that directly produce t28.\n\nWait, no. Looking through, I see NT28's production is NT20 NT11 and other non-terminals. None of these directly produce t28. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me scan the entire grammar for any terminals beyond the ones listed.\n\nWait, for example, NT7 has production NT7 \u2192 't66' (line 53) and NT7 \u2192 't73' (line 67). Similarly, NT15 \u2192 t65, NT18 \u2192 t22, and so on.\n\nWait, looking back, for each row, perhaps each line lists a production. For example, row 5: NT15 \u2192 't65'. So, NT15 can directly produce 't65'. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'.\n\nBut for t28, I'm looking for any NT that can directly derive 't28'. Scanning through the grammar:\n\nLooking at the lines, I don't see any production for a non-terminal that directly produces 't28'. For example, no NT line where 'NTx -> t28'. So perhaps 't28' must be derived from a chain of non-terminals?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the string starts with t28. To derive t28, there must be some non-terminal NT that can produce t28 directly. Since in the given grammar, no NT directly produces t28 (I think), that would mean the string can't be derived, because the first token would have to come from a direct production of a non-terminal, but none do. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me double-check the grammar for any NT that directly produces t28. Going through each production of NT:\n\nLooking for any NT where the production is 't28' directly. Scanning the list, I don't see any NT -> 't28' in the given productions. \n\nSo that would imply that it's impossible for t28 to appear as the first symbol in the string because no non-terminal directly produces t28. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through all the terminal productions:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t72\n\nNT4 \u2192 t29\n\nNT21 \u2192 t37\n\nNT17 \u2192 t73\n\nNT22 \u2192 t81\n\nNT0 \u2192 t66\n\nNT19 \u2192 t47\n\nNT33 \u2192 t30\n\nNT34 \u2192 t3\n\nNT6 \u2192 t20\n\nNT1 \u2192 t61\n\nNT28 \u2192 NT20 NT11\n\nWait, NT28's production is to NT20 and NT11, which are non-terminals. So, 't28' can't be directly produced.\n\nTherefore, the first token 't28' can't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-560","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've been given this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a bunch of productions, each starting with a non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals or terminals on the right. Since it's in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which simplifies parsing, probably using something like the CYK algorithm. But I might not need a full parser since I can analyze the string directly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is:\nt72 t18 t0 t37 t66 t65 t0 t72 t45 t72 t18 t66 t54 t66 t83 t45 t83 t3 t40 t12 t65 t66 t54 t50 t66 t72 t43 t73 t66 t47 t50.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol, which is S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first step is that the entire string must be derivable from S, meaning S should produce the entire string through a series of expansions.\n\nLooking at S's production, the left-hand side is S, and the right-hand side is NT6 and NT34. So, the first two symbols in the string should come from NT6 and NT34. Let me check the string: it starts with t72, then t18. Wait, in the grammar, NT6 is 't20' and 't80', and in the initial productions, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, etc. Also, there's another production NT6 \u2192 't20' and 't80'. Hmm, but in the string, the first symbol is t72. Looking back at the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't66' and 't73'. There's also NT7 in NT6's productions, like NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and NT27 is 't72' and 't12', but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to process the string by finding the leftmost non-terminal and trying to match its productions. But since the grammar is in CNF, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, I can try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S.\n\nThe string is a series of t's followed by numbers. Each could be a terminal or a non-terminal. But since all productions in CNF either expand into two symbols (non-term or terminal) or a single terminal, the string must be parsed as a sequence of such steps.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with the string: [t72, t18, t0, t37, t66, t65, t0, t72, t45, t72, t18, t66, t54, t66, t83, t45, t83, t3, t40, t12, t65, t66, t54, t50, t66, t72, t43, t73, t66, t47, t50]\n\nI'll start with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the first two symbols must be produced by NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, t72. Let's find what NT6 can produce that.\n\nLooking up NT6 in the grammar:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 or NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19, etc., but also NT6 has productions to 't20' and 't80' via more rules. Wait, actually, looking back, I might have misread. Let me look again at NT6:\n\nThe grammar shows:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT6 -> NT33 NT19 [Wait, perhaps I'm missing some entries. Let me check.]\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, under NT6, there are multiple productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 [Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but assuming it's correct.]\n\nAlso, looking further, there's NT6 -> 't20' and 't80' because under NT7, we have NT7 -> NT6 NT7, etc. Wait, perhaps not. Let me look more carefully.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see several entries starting with NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- ...\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT18 -> something\n- ...\n\nWait, but looking at the structure of NT6's productions, I think I might have misparsed some.

{"custom_id":"request-573","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string to evaluate is \"t0 t45 t66 t65 t66 t29 t66 t39 t0 t68 t53 t45 t37 t61 t0 t66 t72 t43 t65 t66 t83 t66 t66 t73 t66 t72 t45 t11 t3 t53 t23 t3\".\n\nFirst, I'll think about how the string is structured. Each part of the string is either a non-terminal that expands into two terminals or a terminal itself. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every non-terminal must derive a sequence of two terminals, and the entire string must be built up by expanding the starting symbol S step by step.\n\nThe given grammar starts with S -> NT6 NT34. So S is the start symbol. Let's try to see how the string starts.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is \"t0\". Now, we need to see if S can derive this t0 as the start. Let's examine the expansions for the non-terminals NT6 and NT34.\n\nStarting with NT6. Looking at the productions for NT6, we see several options, but ultimately, it's a terminal or expanded into other non-terminals. For example, NT6 can go to NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19, etc. Each of these further expands into more non-terminals, and so on, until they reach terminals like 't20', 't66', etc. So to get \"t0\" as the first symbol, we need to see if there's a production path where the first symbol is t0.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that NT10 can produce 't66', 't12', 't14', etc., but where does t0 come from? Checking the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT0, one of the productions is NT0 -> 't66', and another is NT0 -> 't0'. So NT0 can produce 't66' or 't0'. So if NT0 can produce 't0', that part is valid.\n\nSo in S -> NT6 NT34, one of these non-terminals (NT6 or NT34) must produce \"t0\". Let's see which one.\n\nNT6: Let's see its productions. NT6 can expand into NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25 or NT19 NT25, etc. So it's a bit nested, but in the end, it should produce terminals, and looking through the rules, I need to see if any path leads to t0. But from NT6's productions, I don't see 't0' directly, but maybe through another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should check NT1 or other non-terminals. Let me think about the starting non-terminals.\n\nWait, S starts with NT6 and NT34. Each of these must produce a terminal string leading to the given string.\n\nLet's break the given string into tokens. The string is:\n\nt0 t45 t66 t65 t66 t29 t66 t39 t0 t68 t53 t45 t37 t61 t0 t66 t72 t43 t65 t66 t83 t66 t66 t73 t66 t72 t45 t11 t3 t53 t23 t3.\n\nIt's a sequence of 31 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each expansion step doubles the number of symbols, but the initial S should eventually derive a string that is processed as a series of expansions.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the first token is t0, and see which non terminals can produce t0. Looking at NT0's productions: NT0 can go to 't66' or 't0'. So NT0 can directly produce t0. Now, in S's productions, can any of the non-terminals that S directly expands into produce t0?\n\nS -> NT6 NT34. So one of NT6 or NT34 must produce t0.\n\nLooking at NT6, all the productions for NT6 further expand into other non-terminals. Does NT6 ever reach t0? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 or NT33 NT19 or NT21 NT25 or NT19 NT25, etc.\n\nNT27 can produce 't72', 't73', and also other NTs. For example, NT27 -> NT7 NT7, and NT7 has two options: 't66' and 't73'. So NT27 can derive t72 via NT7->t66 twice? Wait, no, NT7 is either 't66' or 't73'. Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, looking at NT7, it's actually defined as NT7 -> t66 or t73. But wait, looking back, in the grammar, NT7 is not present. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no: The grammar doesn't have NT7; instead, looking through the productions, I see NT7 being present in some places. Like NT27's production is NT7 NT7, and NT7 has options. Wait, in the given grammar, let's check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t66\n\nWait, no, actually, I see that NT7 is a terminal in some rules, but no, actually, I might have misread. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7\nNT7 -> 't66' (in multiple places)\n\nWait, no, looking through each rule, I don't see NT7 as a non-terminal. Let me check all the rules:\n\nLooking back:\n\n- NT27 -> NT7 NT7\n- NT13 -> NT7 NT6 (Wait no, NT13 isn't in the grammar, I see from NT6: it's NT27, NT19, etc.)\n\nWait, actually, I don't see NT7 being defined as a non-terminal, but perhaps NT7 is just a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, looking through all the grammar rules, every time it says, for example, 'NT6 -> t27 t19', that means t27 is a terminal.\n\nSo in other words, all the symbols like 'NT14', 'NT2', etc., are non-terminals except when they appear with a 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nTherefore, when the grammar says, for example, NT6 -> NT27 NT19, that's a production where NT6 expands into two non-terminals. But when it says NT6 -> t0, that's a terminal production.\n\nSo looking at NT6, its productions are all either non-terminals or some reach directly to terminals. Therefore, to see if NT6 can derive t0, we need to see if any path from NT6 leads to t0.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, let's see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\n\nNT27 can expand into NT7 NT7 or NT31 NT17, etc. NT7 in this context: if NT7 is a terminal, then NT7 would be, say, 't66' and 't73', as in some rules.\n\nWait, for example, I see NT7->t66 and NT7->t72. Or, wait, looking at NT27:\n\nNT27 -> NT7 NT7 or NT31 NT17, etc.\n\nIf NT7 is a terminal, then NT7 can produce 't66' or 't72' or other terminals.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, many rules end with 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nSo the process is: for S -> NT6 NT34, both NT6 and NT34 must produce sequences of terminals. So for t0 to be the first token, either NT0 must be one of the non-terminals in the expansions. Wait, no, because S expands into NT6 and NT34. So one of those must produce t0 as their leftmost symbol.\n\nWait, S is S -> NT6 NT34. So the string starts with NT6's expansion followed by NT34's expansion.\n\nSo for the first token to be t0, that t0 must come from NT6's expansion.\n\nTherefore, we need to see if NT6 can produce t0 as part of its expansion. But looking at NT6's productions, none of them immediately produce 't0'; they all produce pairs of non-terminals. So unless through a series of expansions, one of those non-terminals eventually produces 't0'.\n\nSo let's trace the possible expansions for NT6.\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-572","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar is pretty detailed, with a bunch of production rules for different non-terminals (NT1, NT2, etc.) and terminals (like 't0', 't1', up to 't84'). The string I need to evaluate is a series of these terminals: \n\nt68 t54 t66 t73 t39 t66 t37 t28 t37 t0 t65 t0 t72 t45 t66 t66 t73 t36 t0 t67 t45 t67 t45 t67 t45 t83 t66 t54 t25 t0 t23 t50.\n\nAlright, let's start by recalling what Chomsky normal form is. In CNF, every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Also, the start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side of any production. The structure of the grammar here seems to be in CNF since each rule has either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string is a series of terminals, so each symbol in the string must be generated by a production rule that directly outputs that terminal. That means each terminal in the string must correspond to a production rule where the non-terminal on the left is replaced by that terminal.\n\nFirst, let's note that the grammar has non-terminals on the left side, and each non-terminal has specific production rules. For example, NT1 -> NT14 NT28. So, to derive the terminals in the string, we might have to follow a series of steps applying these production rules.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, it's going to be a bit tedious to track every step. Instead, let's think about how to approach this systematically.\n\n1. **Identify Start Symbol:** The start symbol is S. Let's recall the production rules for S: S -> NT6 NT34. So, the string must start with whatever NT6 and NT34 generate. Let's check if our string starts with the first symbols that NT6 or NT34 can produce.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t68. So, we need to find a production rule for NT6 or NT34 that can produce t68.\n\nWait a minute, in the provided grammar, the NT6 has multiple production rules. Let's list the NT6 rules:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT17 NT7\nNT6 -> NT22 NT25\nNT6 -> NT18 NT0\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nWait, the user's initial message actually has more lines for NT6. Let me check again:\n\nLooking back, under NT6, the rules are:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT17 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT22 NT25\n- NT6 -> NT18 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT21 NT25\n\nSo the terminals for NT6, when it produces a terminal symbol directly, include 't20' in one rule (NT6 -> 't20'). But in the string, the first symbol is 't68', which isn't a direct production of NT6. Hmm, that might be a problem. Wait, let me check the NT6 production again.\n\nWait, in the initial question, under NT6, do we have any rule where NT6 produces a terminal directly? Let me check:\n\nAh, here's a production rule for NT6 in the initial list:\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo NT6 can directly produce 't20'. But the first symbol in the string is 't68', not 't20'. So that's confusing. Maybe I misread the grammar. Let's confirm all NT6 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided by the user, I see under NT6:\n\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n\nSo NT6 can go directly to 't20'. If the string starts with 't68', that's a problem because NT6 can't produce 't68' directly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Wait, the NT6 rules are all of the form NTx -> NTy NTz or NTx -> a terminal. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nFor NT6, we have:\n\nNT6 -> 't20'\n\nYes. So NT6 directly produces 't20'. Therefore, in the string, the first symbol must come from NT6 -> 't20'. But the string starts with 't68', which is not 't20'. So perhaps the string is invalid immediately. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order of symbols. Let me double-check the string.\n\nThe string is: t68 t54 t66 t73 t39 t66 t37 t28 t37 t0 t65 t0 t72 t45 t66 t66 t73 t36 t0 t67 t45 t67 t45 t67 t45 t83 t66 t54 t25 t0 t23 t50.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the string is supposed to be composed of multiple NT symbols that eventually derive into t symbols. So maybe the string starts with something generated by NT6, which then further breaks down into other symbols. But NT6 can only directly produce 't20', but the string starts with t68, so that might not fit unless the string has an earlier part that's a longer sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Each production rule's left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) can be other non-terminals or terminals. So to generate the string, we have to build it step by step, starting from S, and each step replacing a non-terminal with its RHS until all non-terminals are replaced with terminals.\n\nSo the string is a series of terminals, but the order may not directly correspond to the replacements unless each terminal is generated directly by a production. Wait, but since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are either A->BC (two non-terminals) or A->a (terminal). Therefore, the entire string must be built from a series of such production steps.\n\nBut for that, the string itself must be such that every substring of two symbols can be built by the production rules without non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down into a structure where each step replaces a non-terminal with its RHS.\n\nBut in this case, the string is given as a flat sequence of terminals. That suggests that the derivation process must have resulted in all non-terminals being replaced by their terminals, forming this exact sequence.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps another approach is to look at the string and see if each symbol can be generated by a production rule's terminal. Let's list all the symbols:\n\nt68, t54, t66, t73, t39, t66, t37, t28, t37, t0, t65, t0, t72, t45, t66, t66, t73, t36, t0, t67, t45, t67, t45, t67, t45, t83, t66, t54, t25, t0, t23, t50.\n\nNow, check each symbol against the direct productions of non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, the direct productions (A->a) are:\n\n- NT1 -> 't61'\n- NT6 -> 't20'\n- NT1 -> 't29' (Wait, but looking back, no. Wait, let me go through each rule.)\n\nWait, the initial message lists each production rule. Let me list all direct productions:\n\nNT1 -> 't61'\nNT1 -> 't29'\n\nWait, no, looking back, in the provided grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. Let's check each line to find A->a.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n1. S -> NT6 NT34\n2. NT14 -> NT2 NT1\n3. NT20 -> NT15 NT0\n4. NT12 -> NT1 NT34\n5. NT19 -> NT24 NT21\n6. NT22 -> NT6 NT19\n7.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This simplifies the analysis because each production splits into exactly two parts, either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t37 t0 t45 t28 t61 t45 t14 t3 t40 t40 t18 t66 t54 t45 t68 t40 t72 t39 t66 t29 t0 t66 t29 t0 t54 t66 t39 t66 t67 t66 t53 t23 t3`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the only production is S -> NT6 NT34. So, the string must start with either NT6 or NT34, and it must be followed by the other. However, in the string, the first token is t37. So I need to check if t37 is compatible with NT6 or NT34.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT1 to NT34:\n\n- NT1: leads to t61\n- NT2: leads to t28\n- NT3: not present in the productions\n- NT4: leads to t29\n- NT6: leads to t20 or t33\n- NT7: leads to t66 or t73\n- NT10: leads to 't12', 't40', 't84', etc.\nWait, but the string starts with t37. So in the grammar, are there any non-terminals that produce t37?\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT37 defined. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me check carefully.\n\nThe terminal symbols in the string are t and numbers, like t37, t45, etc. But in the grammar, the only non-terminals are NT1 to NT34, but none of them directly produce t37. So how could the string start with t37? Maybe I'm misreading something.\n\nWait, let me look at the productions again. Are there any that produce t37 directly or indirectly?

Hmm, wait, actually, in the list, I see NT22 has several productions. Let me check each NT where a terminal could lead to t37.\n\nI don't see any NT productions that directly produce t37. The closest is NT12 -> NT14 NT0, which leads to t28 and t66, etc. But none of them result in t37. So perhaps the string can't be generated because t37 isn't present in any production.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t37, so the parser must start with a production that starts with t37. Since none of the NTs directly produce t37, the answer is No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a rule where a NT produces a sequence that starts with t37, but looking through all the productions, I don't see that. For example, NT25 -> 't45', not t37. Similarly, NT19 -> 't65', etc.\n\nSo unless there's a rule that I overlooked that can derive t37, the string can't be generated.

The string is quite long, and the grammar has a lot of productions, so I need to figure out a systematic way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that CFGs can be parsed using algorithms like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsers. Since this grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This is helpful because CNF has certain properties, like being suitable for the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing.\n\nThe string to parse is: `t0 t65 t0 t72 t66 t66 t66 t28 t72 t45 t66 t73 t65 t66 t11 t45 t72 t0 t22 t45 t67 t66 t66 t84 t18 t0 t73 t66 t66 t11 t0 t53 t23 t3`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which is defined as S -> NT6 NT34.

Wait, no, the order could be preserved or reversed, but according to the production, it's NT6 followed by NT34.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string, it's 't0', which corresponds to NT0 according to the grammar (NT0 -> 't66'). Wait, but NT0 is a non-terminal that produces the terminal 't66'. So if the first token is 't66', that would make sense if the first part is NT0.

Wait, looking at the grammar: NT10 has 't12' and 't84' as terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, each rule is either a production to another NT or a terminal. So, for example, NT10 has rules like -> 't12', -> 't84', etc. So each of these is a production from NT10 to a specific terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are all various 't' followed by numbers. So each token is a terminal, so the parsing needs to match these terminals.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nGiven that S -> NT6 NT34, the first two symbols must be the results of NT6 and NT34, but the order is fixed: first NT6, then NT34.\n\nWait, no, the production is S -> NT6 NT34, meaning the first symbol is NT6, and the second is NT34.\n\nSo the first two tokens in the string must match the productions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't0' which is NT0, but according to the grammar, NT0 -> 't66', so 't0' isn't a terminal for NT0, but wait, does NT0 produce 't0'? Looking back at the grammar, yes, the line is \"NT0 -> 't66'\". Hmm, but the string starts with 't0', which would correspond to NT0 producing 't0'. Wait, no, NT0 is \"t66\".\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT1: can produce 't61', 't29', etc.\n- NT6 -> 't66'\n- NT0 -> 't66'\n- NT10 can produce 't77', 't12', etc. Wait, wait: in the given grammar, I think I need to check all the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all NTTs and their possible terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see. I have this grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm. The string is a series of 't' words, so I suppose each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules to see what the starting symbol is. The first production is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals: NT6 and NT34. So the string must eventually derive down from S.\n\nThe string given is: t37 t0 t18 t66 t28 t29 t66 t73 t66 t66 t68 t53 t45 t54 t45 t54 t66 t67 t41 t66 t66 t45 t61 t38 t0 t66 t66 t66 t66 t47 t47 t66 t14 t71 t50.\n\nLet me write this as a list of tokens for clarity:\n[t37, t0, t18, t66, t28, t29, t66, t73, t66, t66, t68, t53, t45, t54, t45, t54, t66, t67, t41, t66, t66, t45, t61, t38, t0, t66, t66, t66, t66, t47, t47, t66, t14, t71, t50]\n\nI'll try to parse this string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production produces two symbols. So each left-hand side (LHS) of the productions will expand into two terminals or non-terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with t37, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 can produce several things. Let's check all possible NT6 productions.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT2 NT0\n- NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT31\n- NT6 \u2192 NT17 NT7\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT20\n- NT6 \u2192 NT22 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 NT18 NT29\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check the provided grammar. Oh yeah, in the detailed grammar, there are multiple entries for NT6.\n\nSo in the given grammar, NT6 has multiple productions, especially those starting with NT6 \u2192 and followed by other NTs or terminals. I need to find which of these produce 't37'. Let's go through the NT6 productions:\n\n1. NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19: So both are non-terminals. Would that produce 't37'? Only if NT27 and NT19 can produce 't37', but looking at the NTs:\n   - NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT7 NT7 again? Wait, no. NT27 has rules like NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 or NT6 NT20, etc. Wait, let me check the detailed grammar for NT27.\n   - In the grammar, NT27 has two productions: one is NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7, another is NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 again\u2014wait, no, looking back, it's actually:\n   - Wait, the detailed grammar for NT27 is: NT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and NT27 \u2192 NT6 NT20.\n\nHmm, so NT27 can produce NT7 NT7, which might produce terminal symbols. Looking at NT7's rules, NT7 can produce 't66' or 't73'. So if NT27 produces 't66' and 't66', but our string starts with 't37', which isn't 't66' or 't73'.\n\nAlternatively, NT27's other production is NT6 NT20. So if NT6 and NT20 are terminals or non-terminals, let's see: NT6 could be a terminal or not. Wait, if NT6 is a non-terminal, then NT20 is a non-terminal as well, so that would mean two non-terminals, not matching the start of the string which is 't37'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first NT6 in S's expansion isn't via NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. Let me see another NT6 production. Maybe NT6 \u2192 NT33 NT19. What's NT33's rules? Looking back, NT33 \u2192 NT31 NT17. Both are non-terminals. So that production starts with NT33, which is a non-terminal, so the next token would be 't0', which might come from NT19. Wait, NT19 \u2192 't47' and 't23', I think. Looking at the grammar, NT19 has rules:\n- NT19 \u2192 NT24 NT21\n- NT19 \u2192 't47'\n- NT19 \u2192 't23'\n\nSo in the string, the second token is t0. Let's see where t0 comes from. Looking through all the terminals in the grammar:\nNT10 \u2192 t12, t14, t84, t80, t0? Let me check the grammar. Oh, looking through the provided list:\n- NT10 \u2192 't12', 't14', 't84', 't80', 't0' (yes, there's a line for NT10 \u2192 't0')\n\nWait, no, looking at the detailed grammar:\nNT10 has productions like:\n- NT10 \u2192 NT14 NT31\n- NT10 \u2192 't84'\n- NT10 \u2192 't40' (if present?), no, I think I need to scan through all the NT10 \u2192 lines.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has:\n- NT10 \u2192 't12'\n- NT10 \u2192 't14'\n- NT10 \u2192 't84'\n- NT10 \u2192 't80'\n- NT10 \u2192 't0'\n\nYes. So NT10 can produce t0, which is the fourth token in the string: 't77', 't0', 't66', Wait, no: let me look again. The string is: t37 t0 t18 t66 t28 t29 t66 t73 t66 t66 t68 t53 t45 t54 t45 t54 t66 t67 t41 t66 t66 t45 t61 t38 t0 t66 t66 t66 t66 t47 t47 t66 t14 t71 t50.\n\nWait, the second token is t0, so that's 't0'. In the grammar, that's produced by NT10 \u2192 't0'. So in the S expansion, the first NT6 must produce something that leads to the second token being t0.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string starts with t37, t0. So the first two characters are t37 t0. Let's see if any of the NT6 rules can produce t37 followed by something else.\n\nLooking at NT6's possible first symbols:\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 NT18 NT29. Does NT18 produce 't37' and NT29? Let's check the NT18 rules. NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10 or NT17 NT10 again? Wait, checking the grammar, NT18 has:\n- NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10\n- NT10 \u2192 't84', 't40', 't0', etc.\n\nSo if NT18 \u2192 NT17 NT10, and NT17 can produce 't66' and 't73', but our string starts with t37, which isn't any of those. Alternatively, other NT6 rules.\n\nAnother possibility: NT6 \u2192 NT34 NT31. Wait, looking at the grammar, there's NT34 \u2192 't3' and NT31 has multiple productions, many of which involve non-terminals. So if the first NT6 leads to t3, which is 't3' not present in the string, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps NT6 \u2192 NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28. Wait, checking grammar: NT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28. But NT14 \u2192 't72' and NT28 \u2192 't22'. So that would produce t72 t22, but we have t37 next.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by working"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is left-angled and has two non-terminals or a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I need to check if the string derived from S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t37 t66 t66 t61 t45 t54 t66 t39 t66 t73 t66 t65 t0 t73 t73 t66 t54 t45 t28 t0 t66 t72 t18 t66 t54 t66 t67 t0 t53 t45 t54 t50 t40 t12 t47 t3`.\n\nFirst, let me list all the non-terminals and terminals. Non-terminals are the NT-something symbols like NT14, NT27, etc. Terminals are single letters followed by a number, like t37, t66, etc. Wait, no\u2014looking again, the terminals are actually letters followed by a single digit or maybe a two-digit number?\n\nWait, the production rules might have mixed single and two-digit numbers. Hmm, but in the string, it's just single letters followed by numbers, like `t37` where 't' is the letter and 37 is the number. So each terminal is a single letter followed by a number, making each terminal a 2-character token. Wait, no\u2014the string is given with spaces, so each token is like t37, t66, etc.\n\nSo, each token is a terminal, represented by a letter followed by a number. Now, I need to see how these tokens can come from the grammar.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and S produces NT6 and NT34. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string must start with the concatenation of NT6 and NT34. Let me look at the string: the first two tokens are t37 and t37. I need to see if NT6 and NT34 can produce t37 and t37.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. S produces NT6 and NT34. So when we expand S, the first two symbols are NT6 and NT34. Then each of these non-terminals can be expanded into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, no. All productions are in CNF, so each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, except when they are terminals. Wait, no\u2014they can expand into two non-terminals or into a terminal. Wait, no\u2014 in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals, except that in some cases, one of the two could be a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, making all production steps involve non-terminals splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? No, wait no\u2014 in CNF, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, no\u2014 the standard CNF allows productions of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals OR A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. But all productions must have exactly two non-terminals, except for when A produces a terminal.\n\nSo, in this grammar, each rule is like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Wait, no\u2014some rules have two non-terminals, others terminate with a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT6 NT34\nNT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1\nNT20 \u2192 NT15 NT0\n...\nNT6 \u2192 t20 etc.\n\nWait, actually, wait. Let's take NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19. So that's a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals. So all productions in the grammar either have two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something?\n\nWait, some rules have two non-terminals, others have a non-terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT1 \u2192 NT14 NT28\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT17 \u2192 NT66\nWait, is NT17 \u2192 't66' a terminal? Or is that a non-terminal rule? Wait, no\u2014 if NT17 is a non-terminal and it's producing a terminal, then the production is NT17 \u2192 t66.\n\nSo, in that case, NT17 is a non-terminal whose expansion is a terminal, so in the derivation, NT17 would produce t66.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 t20 is a production where a non-terminal turns into a terminal 't20'.\n\nSo, I need to see the string and try to match it step by step.\n\nThe string is: t37 t37 t66 t66 t61 t45 t54 t66 t39 t66 t73 t66 t65 t0 t73 t73 t66 t54 t45 t28 t0 t66 t72 t18 t66 t54 t66 t67 t0 t53 t45 t54 t50 t40 p12 t47 t3.\n\nWait, wait, the last part is p12? Or was it a typo? Let me check the string again. Oh, the string is `t37 t37 t66 t66 t61 t45 t54 t66 t39 t66 t73 t66 t65 t0 t73 t73 t66 t54 t45 t28 t0 t66 t72 t18 t66 t54 t66 t67 t0 t53 t45 t54 t50 p40 t12 t47 t3`.\n\nWait, actually, that's a typo in the string\u2014it should be 't12', not 'p12'. Okay, so the string is mostly ts with numbers, correct.\n\nLet me start by breaking the string into tokens. So the string is a series of tokens like t37, t66, etc. So each token is a t followed by a number.\n\nNow, since the grammar is CNF, the leftmost non-terminal (S) will split into two parts: NT6 and NT34. So, in the derivation, the first step is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Then each of these non-terminals will be expanded.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t37 t37, that means that NT6 must expand into two terminals, starting with t37 and then another t37. Wait, no\u2014 because in the grammar, NT6 can expand either into two non-terminals or a terminal followed by something.\n\nWait, in the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and among others, NT6 can also expand into t20, t19, etc.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 t20\nNT6 \u2192 t33 NT19\nNT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n...\n\nWait, so there are multiple ways NT6 can be expanded. It can sometimes produce terminals. Looking for where NT6 \u2192 terminal.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 t20\n- NT6 \u2192 t33 NT19\n- NT6 \u2192 NT21 NT25\n- NT6 \u2192 t52\n\nSo, NT6 can produce t20, t33 NT19 (a terminal followed by another non-terminal), or t52, which is a terminal.\n\nSo, for NT6, possible expansions are:\n\n- t20\n- t33 NT19\n- t52\n\nSimilarly, looking for where NT34 is produced. NT34 \u2192 t3, according to the rules.\n\nSo, S produces NT6 NT34, which would need to produce the first two tokens t37 and t37. But S's expansion is NT6 and NT34.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me clarify: S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So in the derivation, the first two symbols generated would be the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo the string starts with t37 t37 t66... So if NT6 is the first, its expansion would produce the first token or parts of it. Similarly, NT34 would produce the second token, etc.\n\nWait no, the entire string is a series of symbols, so S must expand into something that starts with t37, t37, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to match the string step by step, expanding each non-terminal into terminals or non-terminals. Let me consider each token and see if it can be generated from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for a leftmost derivation approach.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT6 NT34.\n\nBut our string starts with t3"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-639","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar has several productions, and the string is a series of tokens (like 't28', 't66', etc.). I'm a bit rusty on parsing algorithms, but I think the best approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the grammar to understand the non-terminals and terminals. In the given grammar, the start symbol is S, and it seems that all the productions are in the form of two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which is typical for CNF. terminals are strings like 't66', 't28', etc. \n\nLooking at the string: `t28 t29 t0 t54 t28 t0 t66 t29 t66 t66 t66 t37 t61 t18 t0 t67 t66 t28 t72 t18 t0 t72 t65 t66 t72 t45 t54 t66 t53 t45 t11 t45 t72 t66 t67 t35 t23 t50`. That's 38 tokens, so the string length is 38. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left and each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, the grammar is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this case, all productions seem to be two non-terminals except for some that have terminals. Wait, actually, no. Looking again, all productions in the grammar have two non-terminals on the right side, except some have terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, every rule seems to be of the form NTsomething \u2192 NTNT or NTsomething \u2192 terminal. So yes, some productions have terminals as the right-hand side. That\u2019s okay because the grammar can have terminals as well.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but the terminals are represented as single symbols. So in this case, the terminals are the actual 't' strings, so the grammar's non-terminals are the NTsomething, and the terminals are the t's. So the string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar's non-terminals must expand into these.\n\nSo first, I should create a list of all the terminals: t77, t47, t65, t77, t61, t20, t29, t72, t18, etc. But wait, the string we're given has a lot of these t's, like t28, t29, t0, etc. So the first thing I should do is check if each token in the string is either a terminal defined in the grammar or not. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are the ones that have productions like NT1 \u2192 't61', etc. So any token in the string that isn't of the form NTx where x is a number should be a terminal. So in the string, all the tokens are of the form 't...', so they are terminals. \n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar, the right-hand side is either NTsomething or a terminal. So in the string, 't28' should be a terminal if it is defined in the grammar, but in the grammar, 't28' isn't listed as a defined terminal. Hmm, so this brings up a point: if a token in the string is a terminal that's not present as a terminal in the grammar, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. So in this case, I should check each token to see if it's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t28. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any production where the right-hand side has 't28' as the terminal. For example, NT28 \u2192 't28' isn't in the grammar. So if t28 is in the string, but isn't a defined terminal, then that token can't be derived from the grammar, making the string invalid. Wait, but in the grammar, the terminals are things like 't77', 't47', etc. So in the given string, t28 is not defined, so the entire string can't be generated. \n\nBut wait, that can't be the case because the user presented this as a problem. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me re-examine the grammar. Each production starts with NTxxx and the right-hand side is either an NT or a terminal. For example, NT14 \u2192 NT2 NT1, NT1 \u2192 't61', etc. So each rule in the grammar is either of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 a single terminal. So the terminals are like 't61', 't20', etc.\n\nSo the first step is to confirm that every token in the string that's lowercase letters (like 't28') must be a terminal defined in the grammar. If any token in the string isn't, then the string isn't part of the language.\n\nLooking through the string: t28, t29, t0, t54, etc. Let me check if all of these are defined as terminals. Let's look at the grammar:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't61'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't20'\n\nNT1 \u2192 't29'?\n\nWait, no. Let me check. The grammar says:\n\nNT1 \u2192 't61'\n\nAnother line says NT1 \u2192 't29', so yes, 't29' is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't66', so 't66' is a terminal.\n\nWhat about 't28'? Looking through the grammar, I don't see a production where any NTx leads to 't28'. The closest is line:\n\nNT6 -> 't27 NT19' and also NT6 -> 't20'. Hmm, so NT6 can become 't20'. So 't20' is a terminal, but 't28' isn't in any terminal. So when I see 't28' in the string, it's not in the grammar's terminals, meaning the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me go through each token in the string and see if any are missing.\n\nThe string is: `t28 t29 t0 t54 t28 t0 t66 t29 t66 t66 t66 t37 t61 t18 t0 t67 t66 t28 t72 t18 t0 t72 t65 t66 t72 t45 t54 t66 t53 t45 t11 t45 t72 t66 t67 t35 t23 t50`\n\nSo 't28' appears multiple times. If 't28' is a terminal, then the grammar must have a rule NTxxxx \u2192 't28'. Is it present? Looking through the grammar, I don't see that. The closest is NT6 \u2192 't20' and NT6 \u2192 't27', but I don't see 't28' as a terminal.\n\nSo that means that in the string, 't28' can't be part of the language generated by this grammar because there's no rule that produces 't28'. Therefore, the answer is 'No', the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but is that the end of the story? Maybe I'm missing something. For example, perhaps 't28' is a derived string from non-terminals, but since the grammar produces terminals, if 't28' is a terminal that's not defined, the string is invalid.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that 'No' is the correct answer.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-650","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of a set of production rules for various non-terminals (like S, NT14, etc.) and terminals (like 't66', 't45', etc.). \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means each production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, yes, all rules seem to fit this form. Each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived by starting from the start symbol S and applying the productions until only terminals are left.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the first production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So, the string must start with what NT6 and NT34 produce. Let's look at what NT6 and NT34 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n- NT6 has two productions: one is NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, and another is NT6 \u2192 't20'. Similarly, NT34 \u2192 't3'.\n\nSo, the first part of the string should be either 't20' followed by the output of NT34 (which is 't3'), making 't20 t3', or if NT6 produces something else. Let's check the string. The first token is 't66' followed by 't45', so that doesn't match 't20' 't3'. Hmm, that's a problem because the first part needs to come from NT6 producing either 't20' or another set of non-terminals.\n\nWait, does NT6 have another production that doesn't end with 't20'? Yes, it has NT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19, which are both non-terminals. So, the first part must be the result of NT6 and NT34 expanding, and their expansions must form the string.\n\nBut the string starts with 't66 t45 t28...', which doesn't match 't20 t3', so maybe S's expansion is such that both NT6 and NT34 produce non-terminals, which then expand further.\n\nWait, no. Because the first expansion of S would produce two non-terminals, NT6 and NT34. Each of those must be expanded until they produce terminals, but the overall string would be the concatenation of the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nSo, the entire string must be equal to the concatenation of the expansion of NT6 and the expansion of NT34.\n\nGiven that, the entire string is a sequence of terminals. Let me split it into two parts: the first part from NT6's expansion and the second from NT34's expansion.\n\nThe first production for S is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, so the string must start with NT6's expansion followed by NT34's expansion.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't66', so let's see what NT34 produces. Looking back, NT34 \u2192 't3'. So NT34's expansion is just 't3'. That means, after the expansion of S, the second part must be 't3'. However, the string given ends with ... 't66 t66 t66 t54 t66 t29 t0 t66 t45 t29 t45 t83 t3 t40 t40 t45 t67 t66 t40 t40 t47 t3'. So the last part is 't3', which matches NT34 \u2192 't3'.\n\nBut the first part of the string starts with 't66', which is not 't20' from NT6 \u2192 't20'. Therefore, perhaps NT6 is expanding into more non-terminals. Let's check NT6's production rules again:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19 AND NT6 \u2192 't20'.\n\nSo, if NT6 produces non-terminals, those non-terminals must further expand. The first token in the string is 't66', which is from NT6's expansion, but the only terminal option for NT6 is 't20'. So that doesn't add up because the string starts with 't66', not 't20'. Therefore, perhaps I'm wrong in assuming S's expansion is NT6 NT34.\n\nWait, maybe there's another production for S? Let me check the grammar. The user provided a long list, but looking for S, the first line is S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Are there any other rules for S elsewhere? I don't see any other S productions beyond the first line. So, S can only produce NT6 NT34. So the entire string should be the expansions of NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut NT34's expansion is 't3', but the string ends with 't3' as its last token, and the string is longer than just 't3'. So the string must also include what comes from NT6's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string must be split into two parts: the first part corresponding to NT6's expansion and the second to NT34's. So, NT34 is the last part, which is just 't3', and the first part is the rest of the string that should be NT6's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't66', the next token is 't45', then 't28', etc., which suggests that NT6's expansion is the entire string except the last 't3'. But wait, the string is: 't66 t45 t28 t37 t14 t45 t72 t18 t66 t66 t45 t14 t66 t54 t84 t65 t0 t66 t66 t66 t54 t66 t29 t0 t66 t45 t29 t45 t83 t3 t40 t40 t45 t67 t66 t40 t40 t47 t3'\n\nSo the last token is 't3', which matches NT34 \u2192 't3'. The rest is 43 tokens. So, the first part is 43 tokens, and the second is 1 token, making 44 tokens in total. The input string has 44 tokens, so that checks out.\n\nNow, let's focus on the first 43 tokens: from 't66' up to 't40 t40 t47 t3', excluding the last 't3'. So we need to see if NT6's expansion can produce these tokens, and then NT34 produces 't3'.\n\nBut NT6's expansion must produce the first 43 tokens. Let's see, NT6 can produce 't20' or NT27 NT19. The first token is 't66', so it's not 't20'. Therefore, NT6 must expand into NT27 NT19.\n\nSo, the expansion would be:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT27 NT19\n\nSo, the first part is NT27 NT19. Let's look at their productions.\n\nFor NT27, the productions are:\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't7' (only this production?), looking back, no.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT27:\n\nNT27 has two productions:\n\nNT27 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nand\n\nNT27 \u2192 't7' (looking back, I'm not sure.

{"custom_id":"request-691","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces: `t29 t3 t40 t28 t28 t66 t66 t37 t72 t45 t67 t66 t39 t0 t73 t66 t45 t28 t29 t18 t0 t66 t73 t45 t67 t41 t66 t72 t43 t40 t54 t45 t83 t66 t54 t45 t67 t39 t73 t29 t0 t23 t41`.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the grammar productions to better visualize them. Each rule starts with a non-terminal and has two parts on the right-hand side. For example, S -> NT6 NT34. NT14 -> NT2 NT1, and so on. The important thing is that each production only involves non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string consists of terminals, all 't's followed by numbers. I notice that some numbers repeat, like t29, t66, t45, etc. My goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals and matching the string token by token.\n\nLet's start by looking at the first symbol in the string, which is t29. I need to find a production that starts with a non-terminal that can eventually derive t29.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 -> 't61', NT6 -> 't20', NT1 -> 't29', NT21 -> 't37', etc. So the left-hand side (LHS) of these productions can directly lead to 't29'. For example, NT1 -> 't29' is a production. So the string starts with NT1.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34. Let's see what that gives us. If NT6 and NT34 can derive the rest of the string, that would work.\n\nNT6 has several productions. Let's see:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19 (among others). One of these is NT6 -> 't20'. So if NT6 can produce 't20', that would make sense as the first token is t29, but wait, S produces NT6 and NT34, which are two parts, so the string should have the concatenation of NT6's derivation and NT34's derivation. So the first two tokens would be from NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut wait, in the string, the first token is t29, not t20. So I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which is two non-terminals, so the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT6 generates and what NT34 generates.\n\nWait a minute, the string starts with t29, which would have to come from NT6 because S produces two non-terminals. But looking at NT6's productions, none of them produce 't29'. Let me check: NT6 can produce NT27 NT19, but also NT6 -> 't20'. Wait, no, in the grammar, NT6 -> 't20' is one production. But S is the start symbol, which produces NT6 and NT34. So if I take S \u2192 NT6 NT34, then the first part is NT6, which could produce 't20' directly, right?\n\nBut wait, if NT6 can produce 't20', but the string starts with 't29', which doesn't match 't20'. So S \u2192 NT6 NT34 would require the first part to be 't20', but the string starts with 't29', which doesn't match. So this would mean that the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to parse the string as a sequence of productions. Maybe the string should be broken down into the sequence of non-terminals and then processed. Let me think about it differently.\n\nLet me look at the entire string and see if it can be built by substituting non-terminals step by step.\n\nThe string is: t29 t3 t40 t28 t28 t66 t66 t37 t72 t45 t67 t66 t39 t0 t73 t66 t45 t28 t29 t18 t0 t66 t73 t45 t67 t41 t66 t72 t43 t40 t54 t45 t83 t66 t54 t45 t67 t39 t73 t29 t0 t23 t41.\n\nLet me count the tokens: 1 to let's see, that's 38 tokens. So the string has 38 parts.\n\nWait, but each production in the grammar splits into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but all right-hand sides are non-terminals or terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo perhaps it's a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, expanding into two children.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to write the string as a list of tokens and see if it can be produced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree and see if the string corresponds.\n\nBut this might take a while. Alternatively, I can look for if the tokens can be grouped into pairs that match the productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if any of the non-terminals can derive the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to start by looking at the first token, t29. From the grammar, which non-terminals can generate 't29'? Looking at the productions, I see:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, 't29' appears as NT1's production. So NT1 can generate t29. Then, in the production steps, we might derive NT1 at some point.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT1 is used in other productions. For example, NT21's production includes 't37' from NT21 -> 't37', and NT21 also has other rules, like NT21 -> NT27 NT18, etc.\n\nBut how does that help? Maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be built up by stepwise expansion.\n\nLet me try to think: If the string starts with t29, which comes from NT1. So the first production for NT1 is 't29', so in that case, we don't need to expand NT1 further.\n\nBut then, looking at the grammar, where else does NT1 appear? Let's see:\n\nNT7 -> NT7 NT3, NT6 -> NT27 NT19, NT1 -> NT14 NT28, etc. But perhaps I'm getting off track.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S, which produces NT6 NT34. So the first two tokens must come from NT6 and NT34. But the first token is t29, which is from NT1, so unless NT6 can somehow generate t29 as part of NT6's expansion, it's not matching. But in the grammar, let's see what NT6 produces.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT6 has several productions. One is NT6 -> 't20', another is NT6 -> NT27 NT19, and also NT6 -> NT6 NT25 (Wait, wait, no\u2014it looks like the grammar has:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19\nNT6 -> NT21 NT25\nNT6 -> NT18 NT4\nNT6 -> NT36 NT19 (Wait no, in the grammar, NT6 is on the left, and the right-hand sides are combinations.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 -> NT27 NT19\n- NT6 -> NT33 NT19 (No, looking back at the grammar: the first 10 entries under NT6 are:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT15 -> NT7 NT4\n...\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT6, looking back:\n\nWait the grammar as given:\n\nHere are the non-terminals under NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT27 NT19\nNT6 -> NT33 NT19 (No, wait: looking back, the user's grammar starts with:\n\nS -> NT6 NT34\n\nNT14 -> NT2 NT1\n\nNT20 -> NT15 NT0\n\nNT12 -> NT1 NT34\n\nNT19 -> NT24 NT21\n\nNT22 -> NT6 NT19\n\nNT31 -> NT31 NT17\n\nNT11"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-752","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if a given string is generated by this grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar consists of a series of productions starting from S. Each production seems to split each symbol into two non-terminals or terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate: it's a sequence of 't' followed by two-digit numbers. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nFirst, I notice that S produces NT6 NT34. So the initial step would generate two parts. Each of these NTs must expand further until we get to the terminals in the string.\n\nI'll need to map out all possible expansions step by step, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me look at the string: it starts with t66 t65 t66 t72... Let me see if these correspond to the productions.\n\nFirst, looking at the NT6 in S's production. According to the grammar, NT6 has productions like NT6 -> NT27 NT19, NT6 -> NT33 NT19, etc. Each of these splits into other NTs or, for example, NT6 can go to 't20', 't37', 't52', etc. \n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is t66. Looking at the NT6 productions, I see that NT6 can produce t20, t37, t52, t66, etc. So t66 is one of NT6's options. So the first part could be NT6 producing t66.\n\nThen, the next part is t65. Looking at the rest of the string after t66, it's followed by t65. So after producing t66, the next symbol would have to come from another part. But S's production is two parts: NT6 and NT34. So the string starts with NT6's expansion, which is t66, followed by NT34's expansion, which starts with t3 (from the grammar: NT34 -> t3... So t3 is the start of NT34.\n\nWait, but NT34's first production is t3, so the entire string must have a t3 somewhere. Let me check: the string starts with t66, then t65, t66, t72, etc. After t66, the next t is t65, which is much later. Maybe that doesn't fit. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion goes this way: S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which produces two parts. So the string should be a concatenation of the derivations of NT6 and NT34. So each non-terminal expands into some sequence of terminals and non-terminals, which eventually become the string.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be split into two parts, each starting with the expansion of NT6 and NT34.\n\nLooking at the string: t66 t65 t66 t72 t18 t66 t72 t65 t0 t73 t73 t45 t37 t14 t0 t53 t45 t83 t3 t53 t45 t68 t53 t45 t68 t53 t66 t37 t72 t65 t0 t72 t0 t53 t65 t0 t54 t66 t22 t45 t68 t22 t45 t67 t0 t66 t84 t23 t50.\n\nThat's quite long. Now, each NT's production has various options, but the starting symbols are crucial. For example, NT6 can produce t66, t65, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT6 has multiple productions that produce terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 t66, t65, t73, t72, etc. Similarly, NT34 has NT34 \u2192 t3.\n\nSo let's consider S \u2192 NT6 NT34. So the string would start with the expansion of NT6 followed by the expansion of NT34.\n\nBut in the given string, the first symbols are t66, t65, which seems like two consecutive terminals. However, if NT6 can only produce one terminal at a time, this might not be the case. Wait, no, because each production of NT6 splits it into two non-terminals, which can further split, but eventually produce terminals.\n\nSo maybe the structure is as follows: NT6 expands into some symbols, and NT34 expands into others. Each non-terminal may have multiple steps before reaching terminals.\n\nBut processing the entire string step by step would take too long. Perhaps I can find a way to parse the string based on the grammar.\n\nLet me look for known production sequences.\n\nFirst, NT6 can produce t66, which is one step. Similarly, NT34 can produce t3, which is another step.\n\nBut the string starts with t66, so let's see if that's the case.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols:\n\nt66 t65 t66 t72 t18 t66 t72 t65 t0 t73 t73 t45 t37 t14 t0 t53 t45 t83 t3 t53 t45 t68 t53 t45 t68 t53 t66 t37 t72 t65 t0 t72 t0 t53 t65 t0 t54 t66 t22 t45 t68 t22 t45 t67 t0 t66 t84 t23 t50.\n\nIf the string is split into two parts: the first part from NT6 and the second from NT34.\n\nBut the first symbol is t66, which could come from NT6. Now, the next symbol is t65. But wait, NT6's productions are such that each step splits into two non-terminals until it reaches a terminal. So the sequence would have to be a series of productions that eventually lead to t65.\n\nBut that might be complex. Alternatively, maybe the string is built by recursively expanding each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the presence of t3 somewhere in the string, as it's the first production for NT34.\n\nLooking through the string: after the initial t66 sequence, there's a t3 later on. So perhaps NT34's expansion includes a t3.\n\nLet me try to map a possible derivation path.\n\nSuppose the string starts with NT6 producing t66. Then, after that, NT34 must produce the rest, which includes t3. But the string after t66 is t65, which is much later. Maybe I should look for where t3 appears.\n\nLooking further in the string: there's a t3 at position 18. So maybe the expansion of NT34 starts at that point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial expansion is longer. Let's consider the first few symbols: t66 t65 t66 t72... Maybe each of these can be the result of multiple expansions.\n\nLet me check NT6's productions again. NT6 can produce t66, t65, t73, t72, etc.\n\nFor example, NT6 \u2192 t65 is a direct production. So if the first symbol is t65, that would be one step. But in our case, the first symbol is t66, so that's another possibility.\n\nWait, but if NT6 can go to t66 or t65, and the string starts with t66 followed by t65, perhaps that's a step towards building a longer string.\n\nWait, but how would that work? Because the grammar is in CNF, each step splits a non-terminal into exactly two symbols (terminals or non-terminals). So each production is applied to a non-terminal, replacing it with two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals, which might themselves expand further.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial symbol is S \u2192 NT6 NT34, which are two symbols. But the string has a long sequence, so each of these needs to expand into multiple symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a concatenation of the derived sequences from each of NT6 and NT34.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach is to look for how the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be divided into smaller chunks that match the grammar.\n\nLooking at the start: t66 t65 t66 t72 t18 t66 t72 t65 t0 t73 t73 t45 t37 t14 t0 t53 t45 t83 t3 t53 t45 t68 t53 t45"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.
