{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t22\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. Since the string is a single 't22' token, I need to trace back from the start symbol S to see if it can derive this.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S is replaced by NT9 and NT5. Now, I need to see what NT9 and NT5 can derive into.\n\nNT9 is a non-terminal. From the rules, there's NT93 \u2192 NT9 (but that's not here). Wait, let me check the rules again. Oh, looking through the rules, I don't see NT9 being directly derived. Wait, does NT9 ever appear? All the rules seem to start with NT, except a few are terminals like 't22' and 't15', etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the rules wrong. Let me list all the rules and see if any lead to 't22' when expanded.\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. Oh, so NT22 can derive two different terminals. But does NT22 appear in any derivations from S? Let me check.\n\nSo, from S, I have NT9 and NT5. Now, looking at NT9: checking all the production rules for NT9. Hmm, does any NT9 produce anything useful? Let me see. Scanning the list:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that's under NT93.\n\nWait, I don't see a production for NT9 directly. All the NT9... rules are in NT93. So maybe NT9 doesn't appear elsewhere. So perhaps NT9 can only derive to something else. Let's check NT93.\n\nWait, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. But NT16 has its own production. Let me check: NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88. So NT16 can be broken down. Then NT88 is another non-terminal. Let's see what NT88 can do: NT88 \u2192 NT42 NT27. So NT88 splits into NT42 and NT27. NT27 is a terminal? Let me look: NT27 \u2192 't24'?\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me check the NT27 rule: NT27 \u2192 't24'? No, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT27 \u2192 't36'? Or maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me go step by step. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me start from S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Now, I need to see what NT9 and NT5 can become.\n\nLooking back, do I see any rule where NT9 is on the left? The rules list shows:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88\n- NT27 \u2192 't24' or maybe something else?\n\nWait, looking through all the NT rules, I don't see NT9 producing anything. So if NT9 can't produce anything else, maybe the only way to have 't22' is if some rule eventually produces it. Let me check if any rule directly leads to 't22'.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. So NT22 can become either 't15' or 't9'. Now, does NT22 appear in any derivation from S?\n\nWait, does NT22 get generated from S? From S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and then looking at NT5, NT5 can derive to 't15' and 't8' or something else? Let me check the rules for NT5.\n\nWait, looking through the NT rules, NT5 is not directly in the rules except as parts of other non-terminals, like NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I should see if there's a production sequence from S that ends with 't22'. Let's see: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So NT9 and NT5. If either of them can derive to something that produces 't22', then it's possible.\n\nBut from the rules, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. So maybe NT9 is part of a chain. Let me see.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this methodically. The string is \"t22\". Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each expansion step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nBut in this case, 't22' is a terminal. So, to derive 't22', it must be directly produced by some non-terminal. From the rules, looking at where 't22' is, I see NT22 \u2192 't22'? No, looking at the rules, NT22 produces 't15' and 't9', not 't22'. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, here are the ones for NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' or NT22 \u2192 't9'. There's no rule that produces 't22' directly from NT22. So no, NT22 can't produce 't22'. That means that if any rule leads to NT22, but in this case, the string is 't22', which is a terminal. So unless a non-terminal directly produces 't22', which here isn't the case, the string can't be generated. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake? Let me check if there's any NT that produces 't22'. Oh, looking again, I think I might have missed it. Let me scan the entire list of NT rules to see if any produce 't22'.\n\nLooking through all the NT's, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9'\n- All other NT's don't produce 't22'\n\nSo no NT directly produces 't22'.

NT72 goes to NT14, which then goes to t23. NT28 goes to t10 or NT28. Wait, no, NT28 actually is a rule that produces NT51 and something, but looking again, NT28's productions are to NT51 NT95 and maybe others? Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nNT28 is only in one production: NT9 -> NT72 NT28, which is not correct because NT28 might have other productions. Wait, no, looking at the full grammar:\n\nLooking at NT28, I don't see it being a non-terminal in the left-hand side. Instead, looking at NT28 -> NT51 NT95? No, wait, checking the given grammar:\n\nWait, the grammar is a list of productions. Let's parse it correctly. Looking for NT28: Hmm, I don't see NT28 on the left side of any production. So perhaps NT28 is not a non-terminal, or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I see NT28 only occurs on the left side in NT9's productions, like NT9 -> NT72 NT28, but then in other rules, like NT86 -> NT83 NT27, or NT82 -> NT49 NT9, etc. So I think NT28 is a non-terminal. Wait, no, because in the list of productions, the ones where NT28 appears on the right are, for example, NT93 -> NT6 NT14, but I don't see any production for NT28 as a non-terminal on the left. So maybe NT28 is a terminal? But looking through the productions, I don't see 't28' as a terminal, but in some productions, for example, NT78 -> NT51 NT95, and then on RHS, those are non-terminals, but perhaps some non-terminals derive to 't' strings.\n\nWait, I might be getting confused. Let me make a better approach. I'll look for `t31` in the right-hand sides of the productions. Scanning through the rules:\n\nI see NT87 -> t36, but not t31. Looking again, NT87 -> NT83 NT27, which might produce 't36' perhaps. Wait, no. Let's check the right-hand sides where a 't' is a terminal. Scanning:\n\n- NT87 -> NT73 NT36 \u2192 So NT73 is a non-terminal, and NT36 might produce 't32'? Wait, NT36 has productions like NT36 -> t41, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me look more carefully. The given productions are:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\nNT26 -> 't14'\nNT26 -> 't16'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT84 -> 't5'\nNT85 -> 't4'\nNT28 -> 't10'\nNT8 -> 't2'\nNT83 -> 't8'\nNT93 -> 't6 NT5'\nNT4 -> t35\nNT13 -> t4\nNT66 -> t3\nNT42 -> t24\nNT55 -> t43\netc.\n\nWait, for example, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. So that's where `t31` doesn't directly appear. But maybe through derivations.\n\nWait, looking for 't31' specifically. Looking through the RHS, I see NT73 -> 't34' and NT87 -> 't36', but not 't31'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't31' is derived from a non-terminal that can't be found here. Let me check all the non-terminals. Are any of them have a rule that can produce 't31'?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nCheck NT13: NT13 -> NT36 NT66, and NT66 -> t3.

Wait, but I'm looking for `t31`, which isn't present anywhere in the terminals.\n\nWait, maybe 't31' is derived from a longer path. Let me see if any non-terminals derive to 't31'.\n\nBut looking at all the RHS, every time a terminal is produced, it's like 't15', 't9', etc., but 't31' isn't present anywhere. So does that mean the grammar can't produce 't31' because it's not listed as a terminal in any production?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the RHS again.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The start symbol is S.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, the right-hand side of each production can have at most two non-terminals. So, looking at the bottom of the grammar, each production either turns a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a terminal. \n\nI need to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string step by step. If I can successfully do that, then the string is in the language.\n\nThe start symbol S has only one production: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step is replacing S with NT9 NT5. So the string I need to parse becomes [t22, t36, NT9, NT5].\n\nWait, no. That's not quite right. Actually, when you replace S with NT9 NT5, the string you're trying to parse is \"t22 t36\" but considering that NT9 and NT5 will produce t22 and t36 respectively.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The grammar is used to generate the string, so the process is: the start symbol is S, and we expand it until we get all terminals with no non-terminals left.\n\nSo the initial string is \"t22 t36\". Let me see if it's derived from S.\n\nWe start by expanding S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So now, the string is split into two parts: NT9 and NT5. Each part needs to be expanded further.\n\nNT9's production: Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So each NT9 can be replaced with NT72 and NT23. Similarly, NT5's production is NT52 \u2192 ? Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the grammar shows NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35. Wait, no, actually, looking back, I think I see NT52's productions, but not NT5. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nYes, that's correct. So each NT9 can be replaced by NT72 and NT23.\n\nSimilarly, let's look at NT5. Is there a production for NT5? Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again: The grammar provided has:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nThen, next entries like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc. Let me scan for NT5.\n\nWait, looking for NT5, I see some entries:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nBut that's a terminal. Where is NT5?\n\nWait, here's a part of the grammar:\n\nNT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\n\nWait, looking more closely, perhaps I missed it. Hmm, no, actually, the productions for NT5 aren't listed. That's a problem because S \u2192 NT9 NT5 implies that NT5 must have some production. Wait, maybe it's a terminal? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the later productions:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, no, that's the grammar terminals. So 't22' is a terminal, right? Because in the NT22 production, there are instances where NT22 is replaced by a string of 't's.\n\nBut wait, in the string we're trying to parse, the two tokens are 't22' and 't36'. So, 't22' is a terminal, and 't36' is another terminal.\n\nBut if S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then each of NT9 and NT5 must be able to produce the respective terminals.\n\nWait, but looking at the NT5, is there any production? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I don't see any for NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-14","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out if the string \"t34 t20\" is generated by the given grammar. I'll start by looking at the grammar provided, which is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF requires each production to have at most two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, which seems to be the case here.\n\nThe string \"t34 t20\" is composed of two tokens. In the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce these tokens. For example, NT22 produces 't15', 't9', and 't34' based on the productions:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSimilarly, NT10 produces 't26' and 't26' again (I think that's a mistake; looking back, I see NT10 is actually producing 't26' in multiple places, like NT10 -> 't26' and NT10 -> 't26'). Also, NT55 -> 't20'.\n\nWait, the string is \"t34 t20\", which is two parts: the first is 't34' and the second is 't20'. So, we need to see if we can derive this string step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at how 't34' can appear. Looking at the productions, NT22 can produce 't34' (from NT22 -> 't34'). Also, is there any other NT that can produce 't34'? Let's check:\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, the only one that produces 't34' directly is NT22. So 't34' must come from NT22.\n\nNext, 't20' comes from which NT? From the productions, I see NT10 -> 't26' in multiple places, and NT55 -> 't20' as well as NT15 -> 't4'. Wait, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check the NT55 productions: NT55 -> NT43 NT79 and NT55 -> 't20'. So, NT55 can produce 't20'.\n\nSo, to get 't20', we can have NT55 produce 't20'.\n\nNow, the string is \"t34 t20\", which would come from NT22 producing 't34' and NT55 producing 't20'. But the string is one token at a time, so we need to see if there's a production that connects NT22 and NT55.\n\nLooking back, the top-level production is S->NT9 NT5. So S generates two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. Then, each of those can produce other non-terminals, eventually leading to terminals.\n\nI think the string \"t34 t20\" would be generated by S if S is NT9 and NT5, and each of those produces 't34' and 't20', respectively.\n\nWait, let me check the possible derivations. So, starting with S:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nIf NT9 derives 't34' and NT5 derives 't20', then combining them would give 't34 t20'.\n\nBut first, do NT9 and NT5 exist in the grammar? Looking at the productions, I see NT9 appears in some rules, for example, NT93 -> NT16 NT5, and other places where NT9 might be on the left, but I'm not sure if NT9 specifically is a node that appears in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me check if NT9 can derive 't34'. Looking at NT93: NT93 -> NT16 NT5. But NT93 can also lead to terminal tokens, like in NT95 -> NT79 NT89 or NT93 -> 't31' and 't36' through other productions? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I might have to check all possibilities.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should look for a way to derive 't34' and 't20' step by step.\n\nLet me try to break it down:\n\nFirst, 't34' is from NT22. So, we need to have NT22 appear in the derivation. Similarly, 't20' is from NT55.\n\nSo, perhaps the derivation would look like this:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nBut we need to see if NT9 can derive 't34' and NT5 can derive 't20', or vice versa. Wait, no, in CNF, each production splits into two, so each part comes from a different NT.\n\nWait, perhaps S is NT9 and NT5, and each of those produces 't34' and 't20', so that when combined, they form 't34 t20'.\n\nSo, does NT9 -> 't34'? Or does NT5 -> 't34'? Or does NT22 get involved somehow.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the overall structure. The start symbol is S, which splits into two NTs. Each non-terminal has to generate a token, which in this case is a terminal (the 't' symbols).\n\nSo, perhaps one path is:\n\nS -> NT22 NT55 (Not sure if NT22 and NT55 are the ones that generate the 't's, but let's check the productions).\n\nLooking at NT22: it can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'.\n\nNT55: it can produce NT43 NT79 or 't20'.\n\nIf NT55 produces 't20', and NT22 produces 't34', then combining them could give the desired string.\n\nBut S splits into NT22 and NT55. Does S produce NT22 and NT55? Let me check the grammar.\n\nNo, the top-level production is S-> NT9 NT5. So NT9 and NT5 are the first-level non-terminals. Do NT9 and NT5 produce NT22 and NT55, respectively?\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nNT9 -> something\n\nNT5 -> something\n\nWe need NT9 to produce 't34' and NT5 to produce 't20'.\n\nBut does NT9 ever lead to 't34'? Let me look at the productions for NT9.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT93 appears on the left side of a production, but does NT9 itself generate any terminals? I don't see NT9 in any production on the left side as a non-terminal except in the initial S.\n\nWait, maybe it's more complicated. Let me check each NT to see if they can produce 't34' or 't20'.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT22 can produce 't34'.\n\n- NT55 can produce 't20'.\n\nBut in the initial top-level, S -> NT9 NT5. So, for S to generate 't34' and 't20', both NT9 and NT5 must derive the appropriate tokens.\n\nSo, we need:\n\nNT9 -> 't34'\n\nand\n\nNT5 -> 't20'\n\nBut let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions. Do any of them lead to 't34'? I don't see NT9 in any production on the left that leads to terminals directly. Instead, NT9 appears on the left of productions, but in NT93 -> NT16 NT5.\n\nHmm, so perhaps NT9 doesn't directly produce 't34'. Instead, NT9 is part of a longer chain. Maybe it's part of a chain where it eventually produces a terminal.\n\nSimilarly for NT5.\n\nLooking for NT5's productions. I see NT9 -> NT72 NT23, which seems to go deeper, but I'm not sure. Let me try to trace a possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be generated through S -> NT9 NT5, each leading to a chain that results in the respective 't's.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT9 could lead to NT93, which leads to NT16 and NT5, which then leads to more NTs. But this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is not derivable because the NTs don't produce the necessary tokens.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the string has two tokens, so it's a concatenation of two NTs derived from S. So, each token must be derived by one of the two NTs after expanding.\n\nFor 't34', it must come from an NT that can produce 't34', which is NT22.\n\nFor 't20', it must come from NT55, which can produce 't20'.\n\nSo, S->NT22 NT55 would be needed, but in the grammar, S is only -> NT9 NT5. So, unless NT9 and NT5 can produce NT22 and NT55 respectively, which I don't see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check if NT9 can produce NT22 via its productions.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, the only one is NT93 -> NT16"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it belongs to the language generated by this grammar. The string given is `t15 t15 t4`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT9 and NT5, based on the production S -> NT9 NT5. Each of these NTs (Non-terminals) then produce other combinations, eventually leading to terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see that many of the NTs produce pairs of other NTs, which in turn might produce more nested pairs until they reach a terminal. Some of these terminals are 't24', 't25', etc., but importantly, the string we're checking uses 't15', 't4', and another 't15' before a 't4' at the end.\n\nSo, the string `t15 t15 t4` has three parts. Let me see how to derive this.\n\nStarting with S, we produce NT9 and NT5. So, the first step would be S => NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, NT9 and NT5 are both non-terminals. Let me check their productions.\n\nLooking at NT9: The grammar has multiple productions, but one of them is NT93 -> NT79 NT42, and another is NT9 -> NT72 NT23, but more relevantly, in the provided rules, I notice that NT16 -> NT27 NT88. Wait, but looking for NT9, maybe not directly. Wait, perhaps I should check all NTs that can derive to 't15'. \n\nWait, from the rules, I see that NT22 can produce 't15' and 't9' or 't34'. Specifically, the rules for NT22 are: \n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo, when NT22 is reduced, it can become any of those. Similarly, 't15' is a terminal. Looking back, the string has two 't15's and a 't4'.\n\nSo, perhaps starting with S, I can derive the string by going through NTs that eventually lead to 't15', 't15', and 't4'.\n\nLet's think of each token in the string as a product of different NTs.\n\nFirst 't15': So that's probably coming from NT22 -> 't15'. Similarly, the second 't15' comes from another NT22 -> 't15'. The last 't4' comes from a NT that produces 't4'.\n\nLet me check all the NTs that can derive to 't4'. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT8 -> NT73 NT78\nNT13 -> NT36 NT66\nNT56 -> NT36 NT95\nNT36 -> NT27 NT43\nNT27 is a terminal? Wait, no, looking at the rules, NT27 can produce 't34', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, wait: Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at NT27, I see:\n\nNT27 -> 't34'\n\nSo, when NT27 is used, it becomes 't34'. Hmm, but the string has 't4'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, in the rules, I don't see any NT directly deriving 't4'. Hmm. Let me check carefully.\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT83 NT96\nNT10 -> NT84 NT25\nNT25 is a terminal? No, NT25 is an NT that produces 't25', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps NT10 can produce 't25'. But in the string, we need 't4'. Hmm, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let me see. Is there any NT that directly produces 't4'? Looking through the rules provided, I don't see any NT that has 't4' as a terminal. So perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the NTs. Maybe some of the NTs produce other NTs, and through a chain, they reach a 't4'. Let's see.\n\nFor example, NT12 -> 't10'\nBut 't10' is a terminal, but that's not helpful for 't4'.\n\nWait, looking deeper, perhaps there are chains that reach 't4'. Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT8: It can produce NT73 and NT78.\n\nThen, NT73: It can produce NT8 ->... So, NT73 -> NT87 NT78. Wait, NT87 -> NT36 NT66. Wait, perhaps it's getting too deep.\n\nAlternatively, looking for 't4' as a terminal: checking each NT that can lead to it.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT4 -> NT83 NT96, but that doesn't help. NT10 -> NT84 NT25, but that's 't25'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently: the string is `t15 t15 t4`. So the third token is 't4', which must come from some NT.\n\nBut in the grammar provided, none of the NTs directly produce 't4'. So that might mean that 't4' can't be derived, meaning the string can't be in the language. But wait, maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, let me look again at all the NTs. Is there any production that leads directly or indirectly to 't4'? Let me check:\n\nNT4: NT83 NT96 -> both are NTs, and don't lead to 't4'.\nNT23: NT93 NT22 -> which leads to 't15' for the last part, but not necessarily 't4'.\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that 't4' comes from NT4, but the grammar doesn't have NT4 producing 't4' directly. So perhaps 't4' is not a terminal in this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. If 't4' is not in the grammar, then the string can't be generated. But looking back, perhaps I'm making a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check the list of terminals. The grammar's NTs are all the ones before the '-> t' strings. So, the terminals are given in the rules in the form 'tXX'.\n\nLooking at all the terminal rules, I see:\n\n'NT27 -> 't34''\n'NT4 -> NT83 NT96'\nWait, no, I'm looking for any NT that can derive to 't4' directly. But none of the NTs produce 't4' directly. So perhaps 't4' is not a terminal in this grammar, meaning it's impossible for the string to have a 't4' because that terminal can't be derived from any NT.\n\nTherefore, the string `t15 t15 t4` can't be in the language because 't4' isn't a terminal in this grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-26","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the string `t15 t36 t20` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe string we need to check is `t15 t36 t20`. Each `t` followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, the string has three symbols: t15, t36, t20.\n\nMy first thought is to map each of these terminal symbols back to the non-terminals they come from. Let me look through the productions to find which non-terminals produce each t.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (Wait, no, looking again, I see NT22 is already mapped to 't15' and 't9', and also to 't34' in another production. Oh, wait, let me check again. Looking through the productions, I see NT22 appears in several rules: for example, NT22 -> 't15', NT22 -> 't9', NT22 -> 't34'. So, in the string, the first 't15' must come from NT22 -> 't15'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for 't36'\u2014searching through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> 't41' (But that's not t36)\nWait, looking for 't36' as a terminal production. Scanning through, I see NT56 -> 't37' and NT26 -> 't36'. So, 't36' comes from NT26.\n\nAnd 't20'\u2014looking for 't20' in the productions, I see NT55->'t20'.\n\nSo, the string `t15 t36 t20` corresponds to the path:\n\n- First symbol t15: NT22->t15\n- Second symbol t36: NT26->t36\n- Third symbol t20: NT55->t20\n\nNow, I need to see if there's a derivation from S that can produce these terminal symbols in sequence. Let me reconstruct the possible parse tree starting from S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT9 (non-terminal A) and NT5 (non-terminal B) via S->NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, S starts the derivation as NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, I need to see how these non-terminals can produce the terminals in the string. Let's start by analyzing NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9, what productions can generate it? Let me search through the productions for NT9.\n\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT39 -> NT73 NT13\nWait, none of these are directly producing 't15', 't36', or 't20'. So, I need to look deeper into what NT9 can derive.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, the string is three symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols increases at each step. Wait, no\u2014the initial S is one non-terminal. Each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (thus increasing the count by one each time) until we reach terminals. To get a string of three symbols, starting from S (1) would require two expansions:\n\nFirst expansion: S-> NT9 NT5, which gives two symbols. Then, each of these needs to be expanded further to produce the third symbol.\n\nWait, no, S is the start symbol, so S must be expanded into two non-terminals, each of which needs to be further expanded until we have terminals.\n\nSo, for a string of length 3, the derivation must involve two expansions after S.\n\nLet me try to map this.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, which is 't15' from NT22. So, one of the non-terminals in the expansion chain must be NT22.\n\nSimilarly, the second symbol is 't36' from NT26, so another non-terminal must be NT26.\n\nThe third symbol is 't20' from NT55, so the third non-terminal must be NT55.\n\nBut wait, the string is three symbols. Let me think about the derivation.\n\nThe initial step:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5 (length 2)\n\nThen, each of NT9 and NT5 needs to be expanded. Let's see how:\n\nLooking at NT9: What productions are available?\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT73 NT13\n\nLooking at these, none of them produce 't15', 't36', or 't20' directly. So, I need to see if any of these can expand further.\n\nFor example, NT95 can become NT10 and NT11.\n\nThen, NT10 can expand into 't26' (NT10->'t26'), right? Because in the productions, NT10: 't26' is on the RHS. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT10: several rules, including NT10->'t26'.\n\nWait, looking more closely, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nYes, NT10 is mapped to 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, NT55 is mapped to 't20'.\n\nSo, for the third symbol 't20', NT55 must be expanded to 't20'.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nS->NT9 NT5\n\nNT5 expands as NT52 NT81.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me proceed methodically.\n\nEach non-terminal must expand into other non-terminals until we hit the terminals.\n\nGiven that we have three terminals, the derivation must be as follows:\n\nAt S, we have two non-terminals. Then, each of these must expand in such a way that after both have been expanded (possibly in two levels), we get three terminals in total.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first expansion, we have NT9 NT5. Then, each of these expands again:\n\nNT9 could expand to NT93, NT95, etc., and NT5 could expand to NT52, NT56, etc.\n\nWait, let me list the productions for NT9 and NT5:\n\nNT9 productions: NT93, NT95, NT39.\n\nNT5 productions: NT52, NT56, etc.\n\nLooking for how to get to t15, which comes from NT22.\n\nSimilarly, for t36: comes from NT26.\n\nt20: comes from NT55.\n\nSo, I need to see if there's a way for NT9 and NT5 to expand into other non-terminals that eventually lead to the required t15, t36, and t20.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to look for parse trees that can generate the given string.\n\nLet me first see how NT9 and NT5 can lead to the required terminals.\n\nStarting with NT9: looking for a production chain that leads to 't36' and 't20' (the second and third symbols).\n\nBut 't36' comes from NT26, and 't20' from NT55.\n\nSo, is there a way for NT9 to expand into NT26 and NT55? Let me see.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n\nNT39 \u2192 NT73 NT13\n\nBut none of these directly lead to NT26 or NT55. Alternatively, perhaps through further expansions.\n\nWait, if NT9 produces NT93 and NT95, then each of those can expand further.\n\nFor example, NT93 can become NT16 and NT5.\n\nBut NT16 is mapped to 't37', so that would be a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be generated by replacing non-terminals step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write out the derivation steps.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nWe need to get 't15 t36 t20', so perhaps the two initial non-terminals expand into two paths that contribute two terminals each, but that would give four symbols, which is more than needed. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that one of the non-terminals in the initial expansion produces two terminals, and the other produces one. But that also might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is longer than it seems because of the way the grammar is structured.\n\nWait, maybe I'm"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is \"t35 t32 t14 t37\".\n\nFirst, let me recall what a context-free grammar is. CNF is a form where each production rule has a single non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see it consists of a series of production rules. Some of them are like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, which translates to a production that generates two symbols. There's a lot of NTs, which I assume are non-terminals, and some have productions that directly map to terminals, like NT22 \u2192 't15', indicating that this non-terminal produces the terminal sequence 't15'.\n\nNow, the string to analyze is \"t35 t32 t14 t37\". Each of these are terminals, so the string is a sequence of four terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation can only produce two symbols. Therefore, to generate a string of four terminals, there must be three productions, each expanding a non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nI need to work backwards using the grammar rules to see if I can derive \"t35 t32 t14 t37\".\n\nLet's break down the string into four parts: t35, t32, t14, t37. Since the grammar is in CNF, each non-terminal in the grammar must directly produce two terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the start symbol is S. S -> NT9 NT5. Wait, no\u2014the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9NT5? Or perhaps S \u2192 NT9 NT5 as separate productions? Let me check.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a series of production rules, but I need to find where each non-terminal leads. Looking for terminal symbols, I see NT22 \u2192 't15', NT26 \u2192 't14', NT36 \u2192 't41', NT56 \u2192 't37', and others. Hmm, but the terminals here are 't's with numbers, so I think each terminal in the string is a pair of these.\n\nWait, no\u2014the string is four terminals, each a single 't' followed by a number. Looking at the string: t35, t32, t14, t37.\n\nSo I need to see if these can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce these:\n\n- t14 corresponds to NT26 \u2192 't14' (rule 26: NT26 -> 't14').\n- t37 corresponds to NT56 \u2192 't37' (rule 56: NT56 \u2192 't37').\n- t35 and t32: Hmm, let's check the grammar for any rule that produces 't35' or 't32'.\n\nWait, wait.

Wait, rule 27 says NT27 \u2192 't55'? Let me check: Wait, rule 27 is \"NT27 -> 't64'\", no, let me make sure.\n\nWait, I need to re-examine the grammar. Sometimes these are in a list, so I need to check each rule for NTs that produce the given terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for each terminal in the string in the grammar and see what non-terminals produce them.\n\nStarting with 't35':\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT64 \u2192 't15' (rule 64: NT64 \u2192 't15'), but that's 't15', not 't35'. Similarly, rule 12: NT22 \u2192 't15', rule 15: NT15 \u2192 't4'.\n\nHmm, looking through all the rules, I realize that 't35' isn't directly listed. Wait, rule 36 is NT36 \u2192 't41', rule 35 is ... wait, are there any rules that produce 't35'?\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me scan again: NT36 \u2192 't41', NT32: Not sure, rule 32: NT36 \u2192 't12'?

Hmm.\n\nWait, let me look for 't35' in the production rules. I see that rule 22 is NT22 \u2192 't15', rule 36 is NT36 \u2192 't41', rule 35? Looking again: Oh, perhaps I need to check the list more carefully.\n\nWait, let's read all the productions again:\n\nStarting from rule 1: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S expands to two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note the terminals in the string: t35, t32, t14, t37.\n\nWe need to see if each of these can be generated by the grammar. But looking through the production rules, some of the terminals are derived from non-terminals. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (rule 22).\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (rule 6).\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (rule 15).\n- NT27 \u2192 't55' (rule 27 \u2192 NT27 \u2192 't64'), wait no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confused. Wait, let me check each rule carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all the rules that directly generate terminals, i.e., those where the right-hand side is two terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-33","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine if the string \"t23 t5 t12 t22\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. \n\nLooking at the provided grammar, all the productions seem to follow this structure, confirming that it's indeed in CNF.\n\nNow, the string we're evaluating is a sequence of symbols: t23, t5, t12, t22. Since these are all terminals (they end with numbers), the string is a series of terminals applied through the grammar's derivations.\n\nTo check if this string is generated by the grammar, I can approach this in two ways: either by trying to derive the string from the start symbol, which might be time-consuming given the size of the grammar, or by checking if each terminal symbol in the string can be matched to productions that match each part of the string.\n\nAnother method is to construct a derivation tree that results in this string. Let's try that.\n\nStarting from S, which according to the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nWait, but the first symbol in our string is t23, which is a terminal. But according to the productions, all NT... productions in the grammar seem to eventually produce terminals that correspond to specific t's.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some NT... productions have rules that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nSimilarly, NT27 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo each NT... can produce a specific terminal. Therefore, to see if S \u2192 NT9 NT5 can produce our string, we need to see if the production leads to the correct sequence.\n\nLooking at NT9 in the grammar, we have:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n\nWait, but NT9 itself doesn't have a production that leads directly to a terminal. Let me check the productions for NT9:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (but no NT9 \u2192 something terminal).\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me look again. Are there any productions for NT9 that lead to a terminal?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, and NT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60. Hmm, no NT9 \u2192 a terminal. So NT9 needs to produce some non-terminal that can then produce the appropriate terminal.\n\nWait a second, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions, NT93 has several rules, but none of them seem to directly produce a terminal, but they are combinations like NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can only be checked by attempting to find a path from S through intermediate steps to the terminals in the target string.\n\nBut wait, the string is four terminals: t23, t5, t12, t22. So this would imply a parse tree where the root is S, and the leaves are these t symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can break down the string into the possible intermediate steps.\n\nBut considering that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation should split a non-terminal into two non-terminals, until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to look at each symbol in the string and see if there's a production in the grammar that can produce that symbol's value, and then see if the sequence can be constructed from the start symbol.\n\nBut let's think differently. Each production in the grammar is either a combination of two non-terminals or a terminal. So for the string t23 t5 t12 t22, each t is a terminal that must result from some production.\n\nSo for each t in the string, we can find if it corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar and see if the necessary non-terminals can be split in a way that forms the string.\n\nLet's start by checking each t symbol:\n\n1. t23: Does any rule produce 't23'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9', and NT27 \u2192 't24'. Wait, looking through the given productions, I don't see 't23' directly. Hmm, maybe I missed it?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't6'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT22 has 't15' and 't9'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't5'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\n\nWait, but I don't see 't23' directly. That's odd because the string contains 't23'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are productions like:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', 't9'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't24'\n\nBut I don't see a production for NT23. Wait, is 23 a terminal or a non-terminal? Because the string starts with t23, which is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I don't see any production that produces 't23'. The closest is NT22, which produces t15 and t9, and NT27 produces t24.\n\nWait, that means the first symbol t23 is not present as a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because the grammar doesn't have a rule for t23.\n\nWait, but the input string includes t23, which is not among the terminals present in the grammar. Let me verify by listing all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n' t23 ' \u2192 no, because I don't see it in the list.\n\nWait, let me go through the rules where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nThe rules ending with '(' seem to be the non-terminals. Let me look for any 'terminals' in the RHS (right-hand side) of the productions.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14', 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't73', 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't36', 't66'\n- NT55 \u2192 't43', 't79'\n- NT64 \u2192 't15', 't22'\n- NT27 \u2192 't24'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n- NT51 \u2192 't20'\n- NT5 \u2192 't35'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14', 't25' (duplicate)\n- ...Wait, am I missing any terminals?\n\nI recall that in the grammar, each rule that produces a terminal is of the form A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So, let's check which of these rules produce terminals.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' \u2192 terminal\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' \u2192 terminal\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9' \u2192 terminals?\nWait, no, the production is 't15' and 't9' \u2014 they're terminals? But t15 and t9 must have been defined elsewhere. Wait, are these literals in the grammar, or are they references to other non-terminals? Wait, I think I might be misunderstanding. Let's reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps some of the terms like t15, t9 are non-terminals. Wait, the grammar seems to have a mix. For example, some of the productions end with 't' followed by a number, which are terminals, and others which are another non-terminal, like NT10, etc.\n\nWait, that can't be because in the grammar, all symbols are either NT (non-terminals) or terminals. So, for example, 't23' is a terminal, while 'NT23' is a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I don't see any production that produces 't23'. Only 't15', 't9', 't24', 't5', etc., are in the list. So, the terminal symbols are t2, t4, t5, t6, t9, t14, t15, t16, t23, t24, t25, t26, etc., but not t23 elsewhere.

{"custom_id":"request-52","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t37 t26 t2 t32 t22\". \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have productions that are either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure is helpful because it simplifies the parsing process, often allowing for efficient algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, I'm not sure if I need to use an algorithm here or if I can analyze it manually.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which means the start symbol S expands into two non-terminals. Each of these non-terminals seems to have their own productions, building up the structure of the grammar. Some of the non-terminals expand further into other non-terminals, and eventually, some have productions that result in terminals (like 't' followed by numbers).\n\nThe string to check is \"t37 t26 t2 t32 t22\". Since this is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal in the grammar. My task is to see if there's a derivation path that starts with the start symbol S and through a series of productions, ends up with exactly this string.\n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards from the string, trying to match productions that result in terminal symbols. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a non-terminal breaking down into two non-terminals or a terminal. But wait, in CNF, the terminals are only directly produced by the rules, so any terminal sequence must be generated by a series of such rules.\n\nLooking at the string, let's parse it from the beginning. The first symbol is t37. I need to check if t37 is a terminal in any production. Scanning the grammar, I see that there's NT66 \u2192 t3, but that's not relevant. Wait, looking through the productions, I see that NT87 \u2192 t36, which is a terminal, but that's not t37. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, I need to look for the exact production that yields t37. Looking through the list, I see NT70 \u2192 t78 and NT72 \u2192 t35, etc. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list out all the productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t35\n- NT83 \u2192 t5 (Wait, NT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30, which then breaks down into t's)\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look for direct terminals. \n\nLooking through the productions, I see some like NT70 \u2192 t78, NT6 \u2192 t25, etc. But t37 is present in multiple places. For example, NT78 \u2192 t40, which is a terminal, but that's not helpful for t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the possible ways to generate t37. Looking through the rules, I see NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4, which eventually could lead to t's. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I might look for the direct terminals.\n\nWait, looking again, I see NT70 \u2192 t78, NT72 \u2192 t35, NT6 \u2192 t25, NT71? Wait, no, I don't see NT71. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to see if the string can be broken down step by step using the grammar.\n\nThe string is t37 t26 t2 t32 t22.\n\nEach of these terminals must come from a production that directly yields a terminal or from a chain of productions.\n\nLet's start from the first symbol, t37. Looking for a production that ends with t37. Wait, the only direct terminals are in certain productions. Looking again, I see:\n\nNT13 \u2192 t31 (but that's 31, not 37)\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct terminal as t37. Wait, perhaps it's obtained via a longer chain.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's look through the productions again. Hmm, NT72 \u2192 t35, NT70 \u2192 t78, NT95 \u2192 t10 t11, so that's t10 and t11. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list the productions that result in terminals:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56 (which then can break down into t's) but NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87 (and NT42 \u2192 t12 and NT87 \u2192 t31, t36, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I can try to parse it from the start symbol, applying productions step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, let's see what NT9 and NT5 can produce.\n\nNT9: Looking at the productions, NT9 appears in several rules. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, NT93 has multiple productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for each part of the string and see how they can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the CYK algorithm approach. But since I'm not sure about the parsing table, maybe a better way is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to see if each token in the string is present in the right-hand side of any production. Let's check:\n\nt37: Is there a production that directly yields t37? Looking through the list, I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly becomes t37. So t37 must be a result of a chain of productions.\n\nBut wait, maybe t37 comes from NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4, which then NT21 \u2192 NT42 NT27, and so on. Let's try to break it down.\n\nLet me try to build from the end of the string.\n\nThe last symbol is t22. Looking for a production that yields t22.\n\nI see that NT15 \u2192 t4, but that's t4, not t22.\n\nWait, NT25 \u2192 t25 (from NT25 \u2192 t25). So t22 is another terminal. Looking through the rules, is there any production that yields t22? I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9' in its productions. So t22 is actually 't15' or 't9', not a terminal. Wait, but that's a problem because in the string, t22 is presented as a terminal. So if NT22 \u2192 t15 or t9, then t22 itself is not a terminal; it's a terminal only if it's a letter, but here it's lowercase t followed by a number, which is a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some of the production rules end with 't' and a number, like NT66 \u2192 t3, meaning the non-terminal NT66 produces the terminal 't3'.

Now, the string to evaluate is `t41 t3 t40 t34 t12`.\n\nFirst, I should note that the string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. So it looks like each part between the spaces is a terminal symbol. Let me break it down: t41, t3, t40, t34, t12.\n\nI need to find a derivation starting from S that produces exactly this string. Let's see how that might work.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. Each of these is a non-terminal. So in the first step, S becomes NT9 NT5. Then, each of these can be replaced by other rules.\n\nBut the string starts with t41, which I notice is a terminal. So maybe the first part comes from NT9 or NT5.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT9, I see NT95 -> NT79 NT89, but that doesn't help. Wait, let's check NT93 multiple times because t41 is involved in some of its rules. From the grammar, NT36 -> NT35 NT56 and NT60 -> t12. Hmm, wait, let's see.\n\nWait, the string starts with t41. Let's check which non-terminals produce t41. Looking through the rules, I see NT36 -> 't36' is one, but that's t36, not t41. Wait, no, that's under NT43? No, actually, looking back:\n\nWait, in the rules, there's NT36 -> 't41' with NT36. Yes, under NT36: NT36 -> NT27 NT43, but also NT60 -> t12, and NT60 -> NT35 NT56 is another rule. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking again, under NT60, the production rule is NT60 -> 't12'? Or is it under another rule? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the rules, under NT36 -> 't41' is one of the productions. So NT36 can produce 't41'. Also, under NT56: NT56 -> 't36' and 't37'. Hmm, no, that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, the string begins with t41, so maybe the first part of the string comes from NT36 -> t41. So perhaps the first symbol t41 comes from NT36. Then, the next symbol is t3, which needs to come from another non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, how does the production go? Let's think step by step.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT9 NT5. So S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Now, NT9 can produce NT72 NT23 or other rules, perhaps leading to t41.\n\nWait, looking at the NT9 rules: \n\n- NT93 has several productions, like NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that doesn't help here. However, I see that NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83. NT72 \u2192 't35' and NT83 \u2192 't5', but that's not matching t41. Hmm. Alternatively, is there a way for NT9 to produce t41?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT36 first because t41 is a terminal in NT36's production.\n\nLooking back, under NT36, there's a production: NT36 -> NT27 NT43, but that's not producing a terminal. Also, looking further, in the NT36 section, I see:\n\nNT36 -> 't35' under NT27's production. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall how context-free grammars work, especially in Chomsky normal form. Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to be in CNF because all the productions are of the form NT followed by two other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to check is `t8 t6 t24 t35 t25 t34`. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol S. From the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the initial expansion would involve NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT5, which is defined as NT89 NT35. So after expanding S, I have NT9 and NT5, which then expand to NT9, NT89, and NT35.\n\nWait, but wait, that might not be the correct approach. Let me think again. Actually, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first expansion is NT9 followed by NT5. Each of these will be expanded further.\n\nLooking at NT9, which is NT72 NT23. So that starts the chain. Let me see if each of these can lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, but maybe a better approach is to reverse-engineer the derivation. Let's see what each terminal can be the result of. Starting from the string, each 't' corresponds to a symbol in the grammar. So 't8' could come from NT8, 't6' from NT6, and so on.\n\nLooking at the 't's and their corresponding NTs:\n\nt8 \u2192 NT8 (as seen in production NT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27 with NT8 leading to some other NT, but specifically, looking at the productions for NT8, in the grammar, I don't see a direct production, but wait, did I miss that? Wait, no, looking through the productions, I don't see an NT directly expanding to 't8' except in one place: NT87 \u2192 NT36 NT31? Wait, maybe I'm confusing NT and t.\n\nWait, hold on. The grammar symbols are NT (non-terminals), but when they expand to 't' symbols, those are terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-73","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the string `t12 t32 t26 t24 t20 t12` is generated by the given context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which has each production rule having two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and it directly expands into NT9 NT5 according to the first rule: S -> NT9 NT5. So, any string generated by this grammar will start with NT9 leading to t12 as the first part.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is `t12`, which corresponds to the production rule NT25 -> 't12' (rule 21). So, NT25 must be derived somewhere in the process.\n\nSince S starts with NT9 and NT5, let's see what NT9 and NT5 produce. From the rules, NT9 appears multiple times. One of the rules is NT93 -> NT6 NT14 and others, but NT9 itself has rules like NT93 -> NT25 NT35.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, NT93 expands into several non-terminals and terminals. Specifically, NT93 has multiple production rules, but none of them directly produce a terminal except in some cases. Wait, I think I need to check each NT rule to see which produce terminals.\n\nGoing through the rules, many of the NTs expand into other NTs until they reach a terminal. For example, NT86 can become 't34', NT22 can become 't15', etc.\n\nThe string we have is `t12 t32 t26 t24 t20 t12`. Let's note each part:\n\n1. t12: This comes from NT25 -> 't12' (rule 21)\n2. t32: Looking for a rule that produces 't32'. Scanning the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't32'. Hmm, maybe it's derived from another NT. Wait, rule 57 is NT30 -> 't55', rule 63 is NT10 -> 't26', rule 9 is NT13 -> 't31', rule 34 is NT88 -> 't5', rule 60 is NT60 -> 't12', etc. So, perhaps 't32' is produced from NT36 -> 't27' (rule 33) followed by NT27 -> 't36' (rule 39), but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t12 t32 t26 t24 t20 t12.\n\nSince S starts with NT9 and NT5, let's see if this string can be formed by expanding NT9 into t12 and then NT5 into a sequence that forms the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar: S -> NT9 NT5, so S would generate a string where the first part is derived from NT9 and the second from NT5. But in our string, the first token is t12, which is from NT25, but NT9 doesn't directly produce t12. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the expansion works. NT9 might produce a chain that includes t12 at some point. Let me check the rules for NT9.\n\nLooking up NT9's rules: NT93 -> NT6 NT14 is one rule for NT93, which is part of NT9. Wait, maybe I should trace how NT9 can lead to t12.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps each NT eventually leads to a terminal. Let's see NT9: it can produce NT10, which from rule 16: NT10 -> NT84 NT25, and then NT84 (rule 84: NT84 -> NT28 NT8), etc. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for S, the expansion is NT9 followed by NT5. So the string starts with NT9 producing t12 and then NT5 producing the rest.\n\nBut looking at the first token, t12 is from NT25 (rule 21), which is part of NT93. Wait, let me check rule for NT93: rule 35 is NT93 -> NT6 NT14, and rule 36 is NT93 -> NT79 NT42, etc. So NT93 can produce other NTs which may eventually lead to t12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with t12, which is from NT25, and then the next part is t32, which might come from another expansion.\n\nBut wait, S splits into NT9 and NT5. So after t12 (from NT9), the rest should come from NT5. Let's check what NT5 can produce. The initial part after t12 would be t32, so NT5 needs to produce t32. But looking at the rules for NT5: rule 19 is NT59 -> NT69 NT95, which is part of NT56, and rule 11 is NT52 -> NT60 NT81, which is part of NT4. Maybe this isn't leading directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string is too short or the grammar doesn't allow the sequence.\n\nAnother approach: check each token in the string. The string is t12 t32 t26 t24 t20 t12. There are six tokens, so the parse tree would have a certain depth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each non-terminal leads to a specific terminal. For example, t12 is from NT25, t12 is part of S's expansion. Then the next token t32 would need to come from another NT that's part of the remaining part.\n\nBut wait, the string is t12 followed by t32. So the first part is t12, which is from NT9's expansion, and the second part is t32 from NT5's expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules, does NT5 produce t32? Let me check: looking for a production where NT5 is the non-terminal and has a rule that produces 't32' directly. From the rules, no NT directly produces 't32'. So that's a problem. That would mean that the second token t32 cannot come from NT5, as NT5 doesn't have a production that ends with t32.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated because after t12 from NT9, the next token t32 requires NT5 to produce t32, which is not possible.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the string `t31 t15 t40 t9 t34 t5 t35` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the productions, the only terminal symbols are 't' followed by numbers. So the leaves of any derivation will consist of these 't' terms.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step is to have S produce two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5. Each of these will need to expand further until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe string provided has seven 't' terms. Each of these must come from the terminal productions in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, I see that each non-terminal eventually expands into a string of terminals, but all 't's are single letters. So each step in the expansion must generate a single 't' symbol.\n\nLet's look at the string `t31 t15 t40 t9 t34 t5 t35`. It's a sequence of t's with two-digit indices. Each of these must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Checking the productions, I see that non-terminals like NT15, NT25, etc., have rules that expand into 't' followed by a number. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT27 \u2192 't24', and so on.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated, I can work backwards from the end, trying to parse the string according to the grammar. Alternatively, I can try to see if there's a leftmost derivation that produces this string. Since it's a CNF grammar, each step replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as checking whether the string can be generated by the given grammar. This might involve tracing the possible sources of each 't' symbol.\n\nLooking at the string, let's note the order of the 't's: t31, t15, t40, t9, t34, t5, t35.\n\nI'll try to see which non-terminals could expand into these 't' sequences.\n\nLet's start from the beginning: t31. Looking at the productions, NT73 \u2192 't34', NT87 \u2192 't36', NT4 \u2192 't35', etc. Wait, I don't see a direct production for NT31. Hmm, maybe I'm overlooking something.\n\nWait, the productions have NT13 \u2192 't31', so if NT13 is in the string, it would produce 't31'. So that explains the second 't' in the string: t15 comes from NT22.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the productions. Looking at NT4 \u2192 't35', NT5 \u2192 't22', NT13 \u2192 't31', NT22 \u2192 't15', etc. So the string `t31 t15 t40 t9 t34 t5 t35` corresponds to the sequence of non-terminals: NT13 \u2192 't31', NT22 \u2192 't15', and so on.\n\nLet me map each 't' to its NT:\n\nt31 \u2192 NT13\n\nt15 \u2192 NT22\n\nt40 \u2192 ?\n\nLooking for NT that produces 't40'. Checking the productions, NT73 \u2192 't34', NT87 \u2192 't36', NT24 \u2192 't30'? Wait, NT24 appears in the rules, but I don't see it being a terminal. Wait, NT24 must be a non-terminal that eventually produces a string ending with a 't'. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't30'\n\nWait, so NT24 \u2192 't30', which would produce 't30'. So where does 't40' come from? Looking for NT that directly produces 't40'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't40'. Maybe I missed it. Let me check all the productions with 't' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at NT8 \u2192 't2', NT14 \u2192 't23', NT22 \u2192 't15', NT24 \u2192 't30', NT26 \u2192 't14', NT27 \u2192 't24', NT28 \u2192 't10', NT35 \u2192 't42', NT36 \u2192 various, NT4 \u2192 't35', NT42 \u2192 't24', NT5 \u2192 't22', NT6 \u2192 't25', NT9 \u2192 't72', NT10 \u2192 various, NT11 \u2192 't41', NT12 \u2192 't10', NT15 \u2192 't20', NT21 \u2192 't42', NT22 \u2192 't15', NT43 \u2192 't86', etc.\n\nHmm, no production seems to directly generate 't40'. That's a problem because the third 't' in the string is 't40', but I don't see any NT that can produce that. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me double-check the string. The third token is 't40'. That would require a NT production like NT40 \u2192 't40'. But looking at the productions, I don't see any such rule. All 't's are either two-digit, like 't15' or 't34', but 't40' is not present.\n\nWait, maybe I should look again. Let me check all the productions from NTs to terminals:\n\nLooking for NT_X where X is such that NT_X \u2192 't40'. From the list:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't30'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT28 \u2192 't10'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n\n- And others produce two non-terminals, but none clearly produce 't40'.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made an error in the way the productions are listed. Let me check all the productions again to see if any NT rules produce 't40'.\n\nLooking through the entire list, I don't see any NT that directly expands to 't40'. So, this suggests that the third 't' in the string is 't40', which cannot be generated since there's no corresponding production in the grammar.\n\nThat would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar, so the answer should be 'No'. But wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the productions again.\n\nWait, in the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 't30' which is there. NT30 \u2192 't55' because in the productions, NT30 is shown as producing something else, but 't55' is not the 't's in the string. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't40' comes from a combination of non-terminals. Let's try to see if any NT can produce a sequence that includes 't40'.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe the initial steps of the derivation can help. Starting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nIf NT9 and NT5 are derived into sequences, maybe they can form the string.\n\nBut without knowing the exact expansion of NT9 and NT5, it's hard to say. Let me try to see where 't31' comes from. From NT13 \u2192 't31', so if NT9 and NT5 eventually derive from NT13 and other terms, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the order. Let me try to see each token's origin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string cannot be parsed because 't40' is missing in the grammar. Since 't40' is not a terminal in any production, the string cannot be generated.

{"custom_id":"request-98","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out whether the string \"t24 t41 t20 t35 t20 t15 t35\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. \n\nFirst, I know the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing easier, maybe even using the CYK algorithm. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll have to do it step by step.\n\nThe string is a sequence of t-commands: t24, t41, t20, t35, t20, t15, t35. Each of these corresponds to specific non-terminals, like t24 is NT24, right? Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see NT24, but in the right-hand sides, there's NT24 under certain productions. Let's check each part:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT24 is a terminal:\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\nWait, actually, in the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't24'. So in the rules, some NTs are replaced by terminals, and others are broken down further.\n\nSo, for each t-word, I need to backtrack to the NT that produces it and see how the entire string can be broken down into the grammar's rules.\n\nLet me list the t-commands:\n1. t24 comes from which rule? Looking through the grammar, NT22 \u2192 't24', but that's a single step. Wait, checking the entire grammar, the left-hand side rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces t24. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Oh, wait, in the terminals part, under NT22, it's 't24'. So t24 is only part of NT22.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me clarify. In the grammar, each production on the left side is either a non-terminal split into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal (but in CNF, all productions must be of two non-terminals or a terminal). Wait, no, CNF allows productions of the form A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal. So in this grammar, each rule splits into two non-terminals, which can sometimes be terminals if they are replaced by a symbol that terminates.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar is given as a series of rules like S \u2192 NT9 NT5, Nt52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc., and then some rules where the right side is just a terminal followed by a non-terminal or two terminals? No, wait, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals. So how does that work for terminals?\n\nWait, perhaps some of the right-hand sides are replaced by two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT22 \u2192 't24', which is a single terminal. Similarly, other NTs may produce other terminals. So looking through the grammar, the terminals are at the end of the replacements.\n\nWait, for instance, looking at NT22 \u2192 't24', which means when you reach NT22, you can replace it with 't24'. Similarly, another rule might be like NT23 \u2192 't15', etc.\n\nSo, for the string \"t24 t41 t20 t35 t20 t15 t35\", each of these is a terminal, so each must be derived from a production that results in that terminal.\n\nSo the plan is to represent each terminal as the root of a parse tree, and see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLet's start by identifying each terminal in the string and see which NTs produce them.\n\n1. t24: Looking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't24'. So that's one part. So t24 comes from NT22.\n\n2. t41: Looking through the grammar, where does 't41' come from? Scanning through the rules, I see NT66 \u2192 't41' because under NT66, the production is NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, under NT66: NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13. But that's not a terminal. Let me check further. Wait, under NT13: NT13 \u2192 't31', which is a terminal. But looking for 't41', maybe under NT23? Let me check the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar has:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT15 NT22: which becomes NT15 \u2192 't4' and NT22 \u2192 't24', so 't4 t24'\n\nBut that's not giving 't41'. Alternatively, looking for NT66: NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13. Hmm, but that would be 't4 t31'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's in NT60: NT60 \u2192 NT36' ... No, looking:\n\nWait, NT63 \u2192 NT64' Not sure. Let me check each terminal.\n\nt41: Looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that, when broken down, results in t41. For example, looking up NT26 \u2192 't14' and NT64 \u2192 't36', so NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13, and NT13 \u2192 't31', so 't4 t31' is 't4 t31', which when expanded would be 't4 t31', but that's 't4 t31', which is different from 't41'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me look more closely.\n\nIn the grammar, each rule is either two non-terminals or a combination of a terminal and a non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, all rules are two non-terminals on the right-hand side, but some non-terminals might produce a terminal when expanded. So for example, NT24 could be an NT that directly produces 't24', but I need to check the entire grammar to see if any NTs produce 't41', 't20', etc.\n\nLet's list each t-word and find the NT that can produce it as a terminal.\n\n- 't24' \u2192 NT22\n- 't41' \u2192 Let's look for a rule whose right-hand side includes 't41'. Scanning through:\n\nLooking at NT13 \u2192 't31' (a terminal). NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13: so 't4' followed by 't31' would be 't4 t31'\n\nLooking further, NT42 \u2192 't12' NT56, which is 't12' and whatever NT56 produces.\n\nWait, looking for t41, I don't see any rule directly producing 't41'. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps 't41' comes from NT41 being broken down, but in the grammar, I don't see NT41 being defined as a production. Wait, looking through the grammar, right? Let me check each rule's right-hand side.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for example, NT10 \u2192 't26', NT80 \u2192 't26', etc. Maybe it's in NT6 (wait, looking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16. But NT83 \u2192 't5' and NT16 \u2192 NT37, which is NT37 \u2192 NT85'... Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach this systematically. Let's break down each t-word in the string and see which NTs can produce them, then see if they can connect in a way that forms the entire string.\n\nString: t24 t41 t20 t35 t20 t15 t35\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. t24: comes from NT22 \u2192 't24'\n\n2. t41: Looking for a production that ends with 't41', but I don't see any NT that directly produces 't41'. So perhaps it's derived deeper. Let's check NT66 \u2192 't4' NT13: since NT13 \u2192 't31', so the entire production is 't4 t31'. But I need 't41' which is 't4' followed by 't3' or something else? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let's check the grammar again:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4' NT13: So 't4' followed by 't31'\n\nBut I'm looking for 't41', which is a four-digit t-word, so perhaps it's a part of a longer production. Wait, maybe 't41' comes from a longer NT rule, but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that would produce 't41'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-118","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm given a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, yes, all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are either two non-terminals or terminals. So the grammar is in CNF.\n\nThe string given is `t20 t34 t26 t12 t15 t32 t41 t3`. Each token here is a terminal, right? So I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Each of these NTs is a non-terminal. So the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then each of these NTs can either be terminals or non-terminals. Let's see which ones are non-terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t20. Checking the productions, I see NT20's production is 't20'. Similarly, t34 is in NT24, but wait, in the grammar, NT24 isn't listed directly. Wait, but looking at the productions, NT42 \u2192 t24. So perhaps there's a way through NT24.\n\nWait, but in the string, the sequence starts with t20. So t20 is in the grammar as NT20 \u2192 't20'. So that can come directly from NT20. Similarly, t34: Looking at the productions, I see NT24 \u2192 t24, but that's part of NT42. Hmm, maybe I need to see if there's a way to get t34 via some NT.\n\nWait, wait, in the string, the sequence is t20, t34, t26, etc. Let me write down the string as a sequence: t20, t34, t26, t12, t15, t32, t41, t3.\n\nEach of these should be either a terminal or result from a production.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5. We can split that into NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, T9: Looking at the productions for NT9, I see NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23, and NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 as well. Wait, so NT9 can produce NT72 and NT23, which then would produce t22 or other things. But in the string, we have t20, which is terminal. Wait, that's from NT20. So maybe NT9 is not the one that produces a terminal, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let's map each token to a production.\n\nt20: From NT20 \u2192 't20'.\n\nt34: Let's look for a production that ends with t34. I see NT42 \u2192 't42'? No, wait the grammar says NT42's production is \u2192 't24'. So t34 doesn't appear directly. Hmm, but maybe through NT24 \u2192 't24', but no, the string has t34. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait a second.

Wait, no, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nWait, checking the grammar again:\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT22 is listed as having two productions: \u2192 't15' and \u2192 't9' and... wait, no: Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT22, it's written as:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't15' , \"t9'\", 't34'\". Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me read it carefully:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT22, the rules are:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't15'\", 't9'\", and 't34'\". Or is that the case?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar rules include:\n\nNT22: \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nYes, that's the case. So NT22 can produce t15, t9, or t34.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\n\nWait, no. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, looking again through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 is only present in the following rules? No, under NT22 itself, perhaps not. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the full grammar:\n\n- NT22 is listed as having 't15' and 't9' as its productions? Or not. Let me read all lines starting with NT22:\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT22 appears in:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't15' , 't9', 't34'.\"\n\nWait, no, actually, looking again, I see:\n\nHere's the full grammar:\n\n...\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo yes, NT22 can produce t15, t9, or t34.\n\nSimilarly, NT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo in the string, we have t20, which is in NT20, t34, which can come from NT22, t26, which is in NT26, t12, which is in NT22, t15 comes from NT15, t32 from NT52, t41 from NT36, etc.\n\nWait, let's map each token to a production.\n\nString: t20, t34, t26, t12, t15, t32, t41, t3\n\nLet's try to break this down.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, the next step would involve expanding NT9 and NT5.\n\nWe need to see if each of these NTs can produce a string that leads to the given tokens.\n\nLet me consider the structure step by step.\n\n1.

Looking at the grammar for NT9:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nSo NT9 can produce either NT72 NT23 or itself. Wait, that seems recursive, but more importantly, NT72 and NT23 can produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree from the bottom up, ensuring that each token matches some terminal in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the root S to match the string.\n\nBut this might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the process: start from the end of the string and see if the grammar can derive it.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token in the string corresponds to a possible terminal in some non-terminal, and that those non-terminals can be connected via the productions.\n\nLet's list out each token in the string and see what non-terminals can produce them.\n\n- t20: comes from NT20 \u2192 't20'\n\n- t34: comes from NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\n- t26: comes from NT26 \u2192 't26'\n\n- t12: comes from NT22 \u2192 't12'\n\n- t15: comes from NT15 \u2192 't15'\n\n- t32: comes from NT52 \u2192 't32'\n\n- t41: comes from NT36 \u2192 't41'\n\n- t3: comes from NT8 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, NT8 is not directly a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-117","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is \"t26 t32 t9 t15 t36 t40 t14 t6\". I need to figure out if each \"t\" token in the string is a terminal that's produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, each production is either a terminal, a non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Since this grammar is in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 B C, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the base cases which produce terminals directly.\n\nBut in the provided grammar, I notice that some rules have 't' as a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', and so on. So each 'tX' is a terminal symbol, and each rule that has 'tX' on the RHS is a terminal production.\n\nTo determine if the string is in the language, I'll need to start from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string using the productions.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if each part can be derived from the grammar. Let's break it down:\n\nThe string is: t26 t32 t9 t15 t36 t40 t14 t6\n\nLooking at each part:\n\n1. t26: Check if there's a production that produces 't26'. Looking through the list, I see NT55 \u2192 't26' and NT25 \u2192 't25'. Wait, actually, looking more carefully, I see NT55 \u2192 't20' and other rules. Wait, perhaps I need to find where 't26' is defined.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT55: NT55 \u2192 't20' and NT55 \u2192 't35'. Hmm, not 't26'. Wait, looking back, under NT25: NT25 \u2192 't25'. Under NT80: NT80 \u2192 't26'. So 't26' is the output of NT80. So to get t26, the production must derive from NT80 \u2192 't26'.\n\n2. t32: Maybe from NT64 \u2192 't36' or NT10 \u2192 't8'? Wait, looking through the productions under NT64: NT64 \u2192 nt15 nt22, but that's non-terminal. Wait, I'm perhaps getting confused. Alternatively, looking for a rule where the RHS is 't32'. But in the given grammar, I don't see an explicit production that directly produces 't32'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions, I see that many are non-terminals, but some are terminals. Let's look for where 't32' is defined. Wait, under NT64: I see NT64 \u2192 nt15 nt22, but I don't see 't32' being produced. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe 't32' is part of a production rule. Wait, looking at the grammar list, under NT64, I see:\n\nNT64 -> NT15 NT22\n\nBut I don't see a 't32' in that. Hmm, perhaps 't32' is a terminal, so it must be generated by a direct rule. Wait, looking further, under NT22, it's 't15' and 't9', not 't32'. I don't see a direct production for 't32', which suggests that perhaps it's not present in the grammar. Wait, that can't be right because the question states the string may or may not be in the language. So maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check all terminal productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT64 -> NT15 NT22 (non-terminal)\n- NT10 -> NT84 NT25\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n\nLooking at the end of the provided rules, I don't see any production that leads to 't32'. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking here: \"NT64 -> NT15 NT22; NT15 -> NT80 NT95; NT95 -> NT79 NT42; ... Wait, does any of these directly produce a 't'?\n\nWait, looking through all the RHS, I don't see 't32' anywhere. Wait, maybe I missed a line. Let me scan through them:\n\nLooking for 't' symbols:\n\n- NT22 has 't15' and 't9'\n- NT26 has 't14'\n- NT55 has 't20' and 't35'\n- NT80 has 't26'\n- NT85 has 't21' and 't4'\n- NT14 has 't23' and 't8'\n- NT36 has 't41' and some others\n- NT95 has 't79' and 't42'\n- NT89 has 't72' and 't83'\n- NT7, etc., perhaps some 't's.\n\nI don't see a production that outputs 't32', which suggests that perhaps the string contains a 't32' that is not derivable. But that can't be because the user is asking about this specific string, so maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps the rule is in another form. Looking again, under NT22: \"NT22 -> 't15' NT9\" and \"NT22 -> 't9' NT23\". So 't32' isn't there. Similarly, under NT55: \"NT55 -> 't20'\" and \"NT55 -> 't35'\". Under NT10: \"NT10 -> 't26' NT80\". Under NT72: \"NT72 -> 't35' NT89\". Under NT86: \"NT86 -> 't34' NT27\". Hmm. Wait, is there a production for NT27 that leads to 't32'? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT27: I see \"NT27 -> 't36' NT55\". So from NT27, we can get 't36', but not 't32'.\n\nWait, what about NT84? It says \"NT84 -> NT28 NT8\". So NT84 would derive to 't15' somewhere else? Wait, no, I'm looking for where NT84 leads.\n\nWait, under \"NT28 -> 't15' NT95\". Hmm. So maybe a chain. But I'm not seeing a 't32' anywhere. This makes me think that 't32' is not in the grammar. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated because it includes 't32', which is not a terminal in any production.\n\nBut wait, the user provided a very detailed grammar with many terminals, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me go through each line carefully:\n\nLooking through all the lines, I see:\n\n- NT64 -> NT15 NT22\n- None of the rules start with 't32'. So 't32' is not a terminal, meaning the string has a terminal that's not present. Therefore, the string is not in the language.\n\nBut wait, no, because if 't32' isn't a terminal, then the string can't be derived. So the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread and there's a production that produces 't32' somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules for each non-terminal:\n\nNT22 has 't15' and 't9'\nNT26 has 't14'\nNT55 has 't20' and 't35'\nNT80 has 't26'\nNT85 has 't21' and 't4'\nNT14 has 't23' and 't8'\nNT36 has 't41' and others\nNT95 has 't79' and 't42'\nNT89 has 't72' and 't83'\nNT72 has 't35' and 't89'\nNT86 has 't34' and 't27'\nOther NTs have multiple non-terminal and terminal parts.\n\nI don't see any rule that produces 't32'. Therefore, the string includes a terminal that isn't in the grammar, so the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but that seems odd because the user provided a string with 't32', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. So the answer should be No.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Perhaps the rule is written in a way that I didn't catch.

Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each production takes two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals, and strings are built from left to right.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. So the first step in any derivation must be S \u2192 NT9 NT5. But wait, in the given string, the very first symbol is 't8', which is a terminal. Let me check if NT9 or NT5 can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT9 has several rules. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT83 and NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95. Wait, does any NT9 or NT5 have a path that leads to 't8'?\n\nLooking at the string: the second symbol is 't10', then 't15', 't6', 't15', 't34', 't24', 't36', 't9'. So let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So NT9 will generate some part of the string, and NT5 will generate the rest. Let's see what NT9 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT83\n- NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95 (and other NT78 productions are not shown, but assuming similar)\n- Let's see if any path leads to 't8'. In the provided productions, NT72 \u2192 't35' and NT98 might produce 't8', but wait, looking at NT8's production: NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78, which is not helpful. Wait, let me see NT6's production: NT6 \u2192 't25' is given. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, NT6 is a non-terminal. Let's see what NT6 can do. From the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't25'. So if a non-terminal reaches NT6, it can produce 't25'.\n\nLooking back at NT9: one production is NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT15. Let's check that. If that's the case, then NT9 can go to NT6 and NT15. NT6 is 't25' and NT15 \u2192 't4'. So the path from NT9 would be NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT15 \u2192 't25' 't4' = 't25t4'. But the string starts with 't8', so that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another way. Let me try to see if NT9 can produce 't8'. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT83\n- NT72 \u2192 't35' (since in the given rules, NT72 is given to produce 't35')\n- NT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30\n- Wait, NT83 can go to NT56 and NT30. Then NT56 \u2192 't37' and NT30 \u2192 't55' or another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me try to see if any path from NT9 or NT5 can lead to the symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach this by parsing the string step by step, trying to find a possible derivation tree.\n\nThe string is: t8, t10, t15, t6, t15, t34, t24, t36, t9.\n\nSince the grammar is context-free and in CNF, each production adds exactly two terminals or non-terminals. So the length of the string should be 2N-1 if the grammar's leftmost derivation produces N symbols. Wait, let's count the number of symbols here: 9 symbols, which suggests N=5 (since 2*5 -1=9). Let's check if each step would produce two non-terminals except the last, which becomes a terminal.\n\nLet me try to parse the string:\n\n1. The first symbol is 't8'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't8'.\n\nFrom the productions, NT6 \u2192 't25', NT14 \u2192 't23', NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9', but perhaps no direct production of 't8'. Wait, is there any production that leads to 't8'?\n\nLooking at NT29? Wait, looking through the rules, I see NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95, but I don't see directly any NT derivation that leads to 't8'. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me check all the non-terminals that can produce 't8'.\n\nLooking through the rules provided, I notice:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2' but it's also part of other productions like NT28 \u2192 NT49 NT9 (which isn't helpful)\nWait, looking for 't8' as a terminal. In the grammar, are there any NT productions that output 't8'?\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78, but no terminal, so not helpful.\n- NT26 \u2192 't73' and 't25' are in other productions.\n\nWait, do any non-terminals produce 't8'? Let me check the provided productions again:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't8'. For example, NT8 has productions to other non-terminals, but not directly to 't8'. So perhaps the first symbol 't8' must come from a path where a higher-level non-terminal eventually leads to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire string and see if it can be broken down into two non-terminals at each step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can't be generated because none of the non-terminals directly produce 't8' as a terminal. Let me check all non-terminals that could lead to 't8' in their chain.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Starting with the first symbol, 't8'. Let's see if any production can lead to 't8'. Maybe through chain productions.\n\nLooking through the list, NT26 \u2192 't73' and 't25' (? Wait, looking at NT26's production: NT26 \u2192 't73' and 't25'?

Wait, wait:\n\nLooking at the production:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't73' is written as NT26 \u2192 't73'. And another production is NT26 \u2192 't15'. Wait, yes, line: NT26 \u2192 't73' and NT26 \u2192 't15'?\n\nWait, the given grammar has:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't73' and NT26 \u2192 't15'? Let me check the exact lines.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, one line is:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' and another is NT22 \u2192 't9'.\n\nAnother line is: NT26 \u2192 't73'; another line is NT26 \u2192 't15'. So NT26 can produce 't73' or 't15'.\n\nIf that's the case, then 't8' might not be directly produced by any non-terminal. So maybe the first symbol 't8' can't be produced by the grammar, making the entire string invalid.\n\nWait, but am I sure? Let me double-check the rules. The full list includes:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't73' (I think that's correct, since in the provided, it's NT26 \u2192 't73' and NT26 \u2192 't15'.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should look at the start symbol, which is S. Let's see what S produces. The production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the string starts with NT9 and NT52. \n\nLooking at the provided string, the first elements are `t2 t26 t32...`. So I need to check if these correspond to the productions for NT9 and NT52.\n\nLet's break down NT9 and NT52.\n\nNT9's productions are:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n\nAnd NT52's productions are:\n- NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\n- NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\n- NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\n- Also, looking further, after NT52, there are more options which I should review. Wait, no, from the grammar provided, NT52 has the same two options: NT60 NT81 and NT64 NT96, but in the grammar, it's written twice, so it's still two productions.\n\nI think the structure is that each production for NT52 is to two non-terminals. So looking at the string, the first part is T2, followed by T26, T32, etc. Let me see where T2, T26, etc., map in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NT rules eventually derive into terminal strings. So let's check each terminal in the string against the productions.\n\nStarting with NT9, which can produce NT16 NT5. NT16 can produce NT27 NT88. Let's see what these produce. NT27's productions include NT70 NT25 and others. Wait, no\u2014the NT27 in the grammar has a production NT27 \u2192 't36'. Because in the grammar, NT27 \u2192 't36'. Similarly, NT88 \u2192 't5' as per the rules.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar has:\n\nNT27 \u2192 't36'\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\nNT86 \u2192 't34'\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\nOther NT rules have terminals like 't2', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, so for NT9, one of its productions is NT16 NT5. NT16 can produce either NT27 NT88 or other options. NT27 is a terminal 't36', and NT88 is 't5'.\n\nSo NT16 can derive to 't36' and 't5'. So NT16 \u2192 't36' or 't5'.\n\nThen NT5 can produce NT70 or other options. Let's see NT5's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 NT35 NT61. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me check the grammar rules provided.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided rules, I don't see a direct NT5 production. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking for NT5: It seems that NT5 is not directly present in the rules. Instead, perhaps I misread. Wait, let me scan the rules again.\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nNT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\nNT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n\nWait, but NT5 is not in the list of non-terminals because the start symbol is S, and there's S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So in the given grammar, maybe NT5 is only present in some rules. Wait, looking again, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the non-terminals are: S, NT9, NT52, NT84, NT93, NT69, NT93, NT78, NT15, NT36, NT35, NT42, NT23, NT86, NT79, NT43, NT83, NT82, NT36, NT15, NT88, NT4, NT10, NT56, NT36, NT27, NT50, NT43, NT87, NT82, NT14, NT64, NT49, NT13, NT8, NT86, NT14, NT39, NT73, NT87, NT14, NT16, NT12, NT87, NT28, NT51, NT5, NT26, NT64, NT49, NT13, NT8, NT86, NT14, NT39, NT73, NT87, NT24.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, I don't see a production for NT5, so maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps NT9's production is NT16 NT5, but NT5 isn't a production in the given rules. That can't be right. So perhaps I need to adjust my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the other possibility: NT9's production is NT72 NT23. Let's see where 72 and 23 lead. For NT72, its production is NT2 NT16. Hmm, that could go to t2 t16.\n\nWait, the string starts with t2 t26. Let me see if the production could yield t2.\n\nLooking at NT2's production: Well, I don't see anyone going to NT2 directly. Instead, perhaps NT2 is produced from other non-terminals. Wait, let me check if any NT rules produce NT2. Looking through the list, I don't see any. Wait, perhaps I'm missing NT2's production. Alternatively, maybe NT2 is part of another rule.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's map the string to NT9 and NT52.\n\nFirst, the string is t2 t26 t32 t6 t20 t31 t32 t31 t26.\n\nThe first step is to check if the entire string can be generated by S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo the string would start as (generating from NT9) followed by (generating from NT52). Let's check both parts separately.\n\nFor NT9: The string starts with t2. Looking at the productions of NT9, which are NT16 NT5. So from NT9, let's see if we can derive t2.\n\nBut wait, looking for NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and NT16's productions: NT27 NT88. NT27 is a terminal 't36', and NT88 is 't5'. So NT16 \u2192 't36' and 't5'.\n\nSo from NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5, we have two possibilities:\n\n1. NT16 \u2192 't36' and NT5 \u2192 some production.\n2. NT16 \u2192 't5' and NT5 \u2192 some production.\n\nBut the string starts with t2, so neither t36 nor t5 is t2. So perhaps NT9's other productions are more relevant.\n\nWait, another production for NT9 is NT93 and NT23. So maybe NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23.\n\nLet's look at NT72: It's NT72 \u2192 NT2 NT16. NT2 and NT16.\n\nIf NT72 \u2192 NT2 NT16, then NT2 is a terminal or goes further. Wait, looking through the rules, there's no production for NT2 to a terminal or another non-terminal that leads to t2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me look through the grammar and see if any NT's derivation leads to t2.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, the only NT that leads to t2 is NT26: NT26 \u2192 't34'. Or is NT26 another non-terminal? Let me check:\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT26 \u2192 't34'. So that's t34.\n\nAlternatively, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT825 \u2192 't51', etc.\n\nWait, let me look again for t2. The only NT that directly leads to a t2 is NT5: Hmm, no. Wait, in the provided grammar, is there a production that gives a terminal t2? Let me check:\n\nLooking through all the NT rules:\n\nI see NT88 \u2192 't5', NT6 \u2192 't25', NT27 \u2192 't36', NT56 \u2192 't37', etc. Wait, no t2.

I remember that CNF requires each production rule to have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Here, the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT52. \n\nFirst, I should note that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-151","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t35 t25 t37 t36 t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34`. \n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has productions where each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to follow CNF because each production on the left (like S, NT52, etc.) leads to two non-terminals or terminals. \n\nThe goal is to parse this string into the grammar's rules. Each step should reduce the string correctly according to the productions.\n\nStarting with the string: t35 t25 t37 t36 t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34.\n\nI begin with the start symbol S, which according to the grammar goes to NT9 NT5. So, the string starts with t35, which I look at the productions to see what produces t35. \n\nLooking at the productions, I find NT22 -> 't24' and NT22 can produce 't22' or 't34'. Hmm, no. Wait, in NT22, I see two options: NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9' and other production rules that produce 't34', 't24', etc. But wait, looking closely, I see NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9' as options, but no 't35'. \n\nWait, that's confusing because in the string, the first symbol is t35. Looking through the grammar productions for NT22, I see:\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- And also, looking back, NT22 is part of the string but doesn't produce t35 directly. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial NT5 on the left of S is split into different components. Let me take another approach.\n\nThe S rule is S-> NT9 NT5. So the first symbol should come from NT9 or NT5. The string starts with t35. Looking at NT9's productions, I see NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT93 -> NT16 NT5. Wait, maybe I should look for what NT9 produces.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT93 and NT95, but no direct production for NT9. Hmm, that's odd. So perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the NT9 productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT9 directly. The string starts with t35, which has to come from a production on the left-hand side of a rule. So looking for which non-terminals produce 't35'.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT63 -> 't32' (no), NT36 -> 't41' (no), NT25 -> 't25' (so NT25 is a terminal t25), NT22's first production is 't15', then 't9'. Wait, there's also NT55 -> 't43' but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that each non-terminal on the left can produce a terminal. Let me list the possible non-terminals and their terminal symbols:\n\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't15' and 't9'\n- NT8 -> 't2' and 't73'\n- NT12 -> 't10', etc.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t35. So, which non-terminal on the left produces 't35'? Looking at all productions, I don't see any with 't35' directly. But that can't be right because the string starts with t35. Maybe I misread the productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at NT93 -> NT16 NT5, but no. NT78 -> NT51 NT95, no. NT66 -> 't3', no. Wait, perhaps I'm missing NTsomething -> 't35'. Let me check all the productions. I see NT70 -> NT82 NT52, NT81 -> 't8' etc. Wait, perhaps NT86 -> 't34', NT63 -> 't32', NT64 -> 't15', etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should consider that NT52 could produce t35, but I don't see that directly. Wait, perhaps the string is constructed from multiple rules, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nAnother approach: build the parse tree step by step. Let's start with the string and see if it can be divided into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t35 t25 t37 t36 t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34.\n\nLet me try to split it into chunks that match the initial production S->NT9 NT5. For that, the root would be S, which leads to NT9 and NT5. So the string must start with a part generated by NT9 and then continue withNT5.\n\nBut the first symbol is t35. So which non-terminal on the left produces 't35'? Maybe NT22 doesn't, unless I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the NT5 on the left produces t25, which is the second element of the string.\n\nBut in the initial S rule, it's NT9 followed by NT5, so the first part is NT9 and the second is NT5. So the entire string must be a concatenation where the first part is the expansion of NT9, followed by the expansion of NT5.\n\nSo the string is t35 t25 t37 t36 t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34.\n\nSo first, the part generated by NT9 is the substring \"t35 t25 t37 t36\", and the part generated by NT5 is \"t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34\". Let me check if each of these can be parsed into their respective non-terminals.\n\nStarting with NT9: the substring is t35 t25 t37 t36.\n\nI need to parse t35, which comes from NT9. Let me see which production of NT9 could generate this. But looking at the grammar, I don't see any of the productions for NT9 that generate t35. Maybe NT9 is not the right approach here. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the initial split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial split is incorrect, and the production isn't S-> NT9 NT5. Let me double-check the grammar.\n\nYes, S -> NT9 NT52.\n\nWait, that's right. The grammar is S -> NT9 NT52. I missed that earlier. So the left-hand side is NT9 and NT52.\n\nSo the initial split is S leading to NT9 and NT52. So the string should start with the expansion of NT9 and then the expansion of NT52.\n\nSo the entire string is t35 t25 t37 t36 t8 t32 t8 t20 t22 t34.\n\nSo the first part must come from NT9, which starts with t35. Looking for productions of NT9.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT9 generating t35. Looking through NT9's productions, wait, is there a production for NT9 -> 't35'? Or maybe it's part of a chain.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT95 -> NT10 NT11, but no 't35' there. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps NT9 -> NT72 NT23, and then NT72 and NT23 could generate t35 and t25 respectively.\n\nWait, let's see: NT72 -> 't35', right? Looking at the productions, yes, NT72 -> 't35'. And NT23 -> 't6' according to the rule NT23 -> 't6', but that's not helpful. Wait, looking back: NT23 is a non-terminal, but in the string, after t25 is another t25. Maybe I need to find the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split is S->NT9 NT52. So NT9 is the left side and NT52 is the right. So the string starts with something from NT9 and continues with something from NT52.\n\nSo let's look for the first part of the string generated from NT9.\n\nThe first token is t35. So, does NT9 produce 't35'? I don't see a direct production, so perhaps it's generated through a chain.

{"custom_id":"request-177","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t37 t40 t14 t41 t26 t25 t6 t20 t24 t35 t22`. Let me start by understanding the process.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, except possibly for the start symbol. Looking at the grammar, all productions on the left-hand side (LHS) have a single non-terminal on the left, and on the right-hand side (RHS), there are two non-terminals except for the ones where the RHS is a terminal. Wait, actually in some cases, it seems like the RHS can have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, like `S -> NT9 NT5`\u2014both are non-terminals. But for other rules like `NT9 -> t23`, the RHS is just a terminal.\n\nWait, no, wait. In CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. Wait no, actually in CNF, all productions have exactly two non-terminals on the RHS, right? Because it's a binary tree structure. So perhaps the grammar provided is not exactly in strict CNF. Hmm, maybe it's slightly different, but for the purposes of this problem, I'll proceed.\n\nNow, to generate the given string, I need to trace back from the string to the start symbol S, reconstructing the parse tree. The string consists of a sequence of terminals: t37, t40, t14, t41, t26, t25, t6, t20, t24, t35, t22. So, 11 terminals in order.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree starting from the end of the string, working backwards to see if the start symbol S can generate this string. Alternatively, I could check each production step-by-step, but with such a long string, that might be time-consuming.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for the terminals in the grammar and see how they can be derived. I should check each terminal in the string and see if there's a production that directly or indirectly produces that terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice certain NT rules that directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't34'\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, under NT22, the productions are:\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo NT22 can be t15, t9, or t34. Similarly, other NT rules produce specific terminals.\n\nGiven the string, let's list the terminals in reverse order to see if we can start from the end and work our way up.\n\nWait, actually, in a typical top-down parsing approach, we start from the start symbol and derive the string. But since the problem is to check if the string is generated, perhaps we can look for the entire string as a derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check each production step-by-step. Let me attempt to see if the string can be broken down into the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t37. Looking at the grammar, where is t37 produced? Checking the productions:\n\n- NT16 -> 't37'\nWait, yes, NT16 has a production NT16 -> 't37', and looking at the grammar, under NT16, the RHS is 't37', so it can produce this terminal.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t37, which is from NT16. So, in the derivation, the first step is NT16 \u2192 t37.\n\nThen, the next symbol is t40. But after NT16, we need another non-terminal, because NT16 only produces t37, so the rest of the string must be generated from whatever follows NT16 in the production tree. Wait, no, perhaps NT16 is the root and the entire string is generated from it. Alternatively, the string must be the full expansion from S.\n\nWait, the entire string is t37 t40 t14 t41 t26 t25 t6 t20 t24 t35 t22. So, 11 symbols. So perhaps the start symbol S is at the top, and we need to expand S into the entire string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the start symbol S is directly producing two non-terminals, nt9 and nt5.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first symbol is t37. Let me look at NT9: looking at the productions under NT9:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the top-level productions are NT9 -> NT16 NT5, NT69->NT88 NT26, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the notation. Wait, the grammar is written as:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nThen, NT52 -> NT89 NT35\n\nAnd so on. So, each NT is a non-terminal, and their productions are as given.\n\nSo, S produces NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, in the string, the first symbol is t37, which is the result of NT16. But in the production, NT16 can only produce 't37' as a terminal, so perhaps NT16 is a child of NT9. Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is the start symbol. S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nAssuming the string starts with t37, which is from NT16. So, that suggests that NT9 might expand into something that includes NT16, which then becomes t37.\n\nSo, perhaps NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5, as per the grammar. So, if we take S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and then NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5, then the first part would be NT16, which produces t37, and the next part would be NT5.\n\nWait, but then the string starts with t37, so S's expansion must start with NT9 producing something that leads to t37 followed by other symbols.\n\nWait, but in the string, after t37 comes t40. So, in the parse tree, the root is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then, NT9 \u2192 something, and NT5 \u2192 something else.\n\nBut wait, the first two symbols are t37 and t40. So, perhaps the NT9 produces NT16 (t37) and another non-terminal that produces t40.\n\nLooking at NT16's production, it only has NT16 \u2192 t37 as a terminal. Wait, no, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, under NT16, there's a production NT16 \u2192 't37'. So, but NT16 can't produce anything else because it's only that terminal.\n\nWait, that suggests that NT16 can't have children, so it can't produce any non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-179","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t6 t4 t37 t23 t14 t3 t34 t8 t15 t3 t26`. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF grammars have rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side consists of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Wait, actually, no, the standard CNF allows two non-terminals, right? Or maybe sometimes they're allowed to have one non-terminal and a terminal. Let me double-check. No, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Wait, no, actually CNF only allows two non-terminals on the right. Wait, no, I think sometimes CNF can also include a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but some definitions require right-hand sides to be two non-terminals. Hmm, this can get confusing. Regardless, the key here is that each production directly leads to terminals or other non-terminals step by step.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the non-terminals are all on the left, and each production seems to break down into two parts, sometimes involving terminals. For example, `S -> NT9 NT5`, which means S can be replaced by NT9 and NT5. Similarly, NT52 -> NT89 NT35, and so on. Some of these productions have terminals. Wait, does the grammar contain any terminals except for 't' followed by numbers? For example, in NT8 -> 't3', which I assume is short for 't3'. So each production either breaks into two non-terminals or a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or perhaps both. Wait, in the given rules, there's one that says NT6 -> 't25', so that's a terminal. So that would mean that in some cases, a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol for 't' followed by a number. So the terminals here are 't' followed by numbers like t1, t2, up to t43 or something.\n\nNow, the string we need to check is `t6 t4 t37 t23 t14 t3 t34 t8 t15 t3 t26`. This consists of a series of terminal symbols, all of which are in the form t followed by a number. Looking back at the grammar, each NT can produce either two NTs or some combination that eventually leads to a terminal. The goal is to see if the string can be derived by expanding the start symbol S step by step, breaking it down into smaller parts until we reach terminals.\n\nI think the standard way to approach this is to use a parsing algorithm for CNF grammars, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here because the string is quite long, and the grammar might have many rules, making manual parsing tricky. Alternatively, perhaps we can construct a leftmost derivation or a rightmost derivation and see if it builds up to the given string.\n\nWait, but maybe the string is built by a series of steps where each non-terminal replaces into two others, and so on, until all are terminals. Each non-terminal must split according to the rules, and each split must eventually lead to the string parts.\n\nLet me try to map this string to possible derivations. The string is: t6, t4, t37, t23, t14, t3, t34, t8, t15, t3, t26.\n\nSo we need to see if there's a way to split these in reverse, perhaps building the string from the end. Alternatively, perhaps we can see each pair of terminals and see if they can be the result of a single production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, most productions split into two NTs, so each step splits a non-terminal into two parts. So the string must be a result of a leftmost or rightmost expansion, leading to the given sequence.\n\nLet me see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions. Maybe I can look for parts of the string that match any of the terminal sequences in the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLooking at the list of productions, I see that several of them start with 't' followed by numbers, like NT6 -> 't25', NT8 -> 't2', NT66 -> 't4', etc. So some NTs directly produce a single 't' and a number.\n\nIn the given string, t6 t4 t37 t23 t14 t3 t34 t8 t15 t3 t26, each part is a 't' followed by a number. So perhaps each part corresponds to a production that results in that 't' plus a number.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production either produces two NTs or a terminal. So the string must be built in such a way that each split produces the correct sequence of 't's and numbers.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be split into pairs or individual terms that match the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if there's a way to reconstruct the derivation from the string. Let's consider that the start symbol is S, which splits into NT9 and NT5, according to the first rule: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So in the string S expands into two parts, which then each expand further into their own non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, the given string is a linear sequence of terminals, which I'll index from 1 to 11: t6 t4 t37 t23 t14 t3 t34 t8 t15 t3 t26.\n\nNow, in a leftmost derivation, the start symbol S splits into NT9 and NT5, each of which will then split into their own components. So the resulting string is built by replacing S with NT9 NT5, then each of those with their productions, etc.\n\nWait, actually, in a leftmost derivation, we process the leftmost non-terminal at each step. So starting with S, we have S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then, if we want to continue the derivation, we might expand either NT9 or NT5 first.\n\nWait, but in the given string, the first symbol is t6, which must come from some NT expanding to a terminal. So perhaps the first part of the expansion is NT9, which then expands to a sequence that starts with t6. But I need to see if NT9 can produce a string that starts with t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT37 has a production rule: NT37 -> NT91 NT42, but that seems to be just a starting point. Alternatively, looking for NTs that produce t6 as the first symbol. Let me scan the list of productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I find NT23 \u2192 't15' NT15, but that's t15 followed by NT15. Alternatively, NT15 \u2192 't4' NT70. Hmm, perhaps not directly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to go through the string step by step, seeing which parts can correspond to which productions.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to see if each 't' in the string can correspond to a single-step production that leads directly to that terminal. But that might not be possible because many productions in the grammar are about splitting into two NTs, which would mean that each step would generate two parts, making the string a concatenation of multiple such splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated in steps, with each step splitting an NT into two others, until we reach all terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if the string can be broken down into a structure that mirrors the grammar's production rules. For example, each part of the string should be generated by a production that starts with a NT symbol, which then expands into other NTs until you get to the terminals.\n\nLet me try to think of the string as a sequence of operations. For instance, let's say the string is built from S splitting into two parts, each of which is a string as well, concatenated together.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so the entire string is the concatenation of the expansions of NT9 and NT5. Then the string becomes (NT9 expansion) followed by (NT5 expansion).\n\nNow, the string is t6 t4 t37 t23 t14 t3 t34 t8 t15 t3 t26.\n\nSuppose that NT9 expands into a string starting with t6 and some other terms, and NT5 expands into the rest of the string.\n\nWait, but I don't know the exact expansion of each NT, but perhaps by matching the first few letters.\n\nWait, let's look at NT9:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT9 has a production: NT9 \u2192 NT52 NT5.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the given grammar, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that's another rule. Wait, no, perhaps I'm looking through the list of productions, and I think I need to find each NT and see how it can be broken down.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, here's a list of productions starting with"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That means every step in the derivation is replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals until we get leaves that are terminals. The string we're evaluating consists of terminals, so I should check if these terminals can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the top-level symbol is S -> NT9 NT5. So S must expand into two non-terminals, which then continue to expand until we reach the terminals. Let's map each part of the string to see if it corresponds to the possible paths.\n\nStarting from S, the initial expansion is NT9 and NT5. \n\n NT9 can go to NT72 and NT23, as per the rule NT9 -> NT72 NT23. \n\nNT72 can go to 't35' directly via NT72 -> 't35'. \n\nNT23 can go to NT93 and NT22.

The first symbol is t35, which comes from NT72 -> 't35'. So that's ND1: NT9 (derives to t35 via NT9 -> NT72 NT23) and then ND2: NT23.\n\n2. Now, looking at the first part: t35 comes from NT9 expanding to NT72 NT23. So that's S -> NT9 NT5, where NT9 becomes NT72 NT23 (t35 and... something else).

NT72 -> 't35', so that handles the first token 't35'. Then, after that, we have the remaining tokens: t5, t14, t36, t8, t10, t34, t8, t5, t5, t22, t3.\n\nWait, that's not possible because after expanding S into NT9 and NT5, each of those needs to branch further. Let's consider the production path.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each token and see what non-terminals they come from.\n\nLooking at t35: that's NT72. So looking at NT72 -> 't35' is an option.\n\nWait, no, in the rules, NT72 is a non-terminal that can produce t35. So from S, we can substitute S -> NT9 NT5. Then, NT9 can go to NT72 NT23, which would mean S now is NT72 NT23 NT5.\n\nBut then, NT72 is a non-terminal that can produce 't35' directly, so that's one token down. But in the string, the next token after 't35' is 't5'. So 't5' would have to come from another non-terminal.\n\nLet me see which non-terminals produce 't5'. Looking through the rules, NT5 can produce 't5'. So perhaps after NT72 -> t35, we have something else.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's list all the possible ways to get each terminal.\n\nLooking for each 't' symbol and seeing what non-terminal produces it.\n\n- t35: produced by NT72\n- t5: produced by NT5\n- t14: produced by NT93\n- t36: produced by NT89 or others?\nWait, let me list all the rules that produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\nNT72 -> 't35'\nNT15 -> 't4'\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\nNT27 -> 't24'\nNT23 -> 't34'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT84 -> 't5'\nNT85 -> 't4'\nNT14 -> 't23', 't8'\nNT16 -> 't37'\nNT12 -> 't10'\n... and so on.\n\nSo, the terminals are scattered across non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol S, which has two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminal symbols, so each symbol in the string must be derived from the grammar. The grammar has several production rules that terminate with terminals, which are the 't' symbols followed by numbers. For example, NT6 -> 't25', NT22 -> 't15', etc. So each of these 't' symbols corresponds to specific non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I think I should work backwards from the start symbol S and see if the string can be built up through the productions. S->NT9 NT5. So the string should start with sequences derived from NT9 and NT5. Looking at the string, the first symbols are t5, t25, etc. Let's see what NT5 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT5: I don't see NT5 directly but wait, maybe I'm missing it. Wait, the productions list goes from NT0 to others, but I need to check if any NT5 has a production. Wait, no, the productions provided don't have NT5 as a terminal but perhaps it's derived from something else. Let me check: NT5 is the starting symbol for NT52 in the first production, S->NT9 NT5. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, I think I need to list the productions correctly. The grammar's productions are: \n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nWait, hold on, I'm not sure if NT5 exists as a non-terminal because looking through the productions, I don't see any NT5 listed except perhaps in other productions as part of non-terminals. Wait, no, looking deeper, I only see NT9, NT52, NT84, NT93, etc., but not NT5. So perhaps S->NT9 NT5 is a mistake because NT5 isn't defined. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions: The first one is S->NT9 NT5. But in the list, the non-terminals don't include NT5, NT6, etc. I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nBut looking for NT5, I don't see it in the list of non-terminals. So maybe the production is supposed to be NT5, but NT5 isn't defined as a non-terminal. That seems like a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the production is correct, but the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the beginning of the list says:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\nNT52 -> NT89 NT35\n...\nSo the start symbol S produces NT9 and NT5. Then, I need to see what NT9 and NT5 can produce.\n\nBut looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT5. NT5 isn't mentioned as a non-terminal, only as a terminal in the string. Wait, but in the grammar, all non-terminals are like NT9, NT52, etc. So perhaps S->NT9 NT5 is a mistake because NT5 isn't a non-terminal. Alternatively, maybe NT5 is a non-terminal that somehow resolves to a terminal.\n\nWait, no, the user provided the entire grammar, and I'm supposed to go by that. Let me recheck the productions.\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\nNT5: Wait, no, I don't see any production for NT5. The productions start with S, then NT52, NT84, etc. So perhaps the production S->NT9 NT5 is problematic because NT5 isn't defined. That would mean the grammar isn't well-formed because NT5 is used on the right-hand side but isn't defined anywhere.\n\nIf that's the case, then the grammar as given is invalid. But wait, the user presented the grammar as correct, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the productions, the first line is S -> NT9 NT5. Then, further down, there's NT22 -> 't15' and others. There's no production for NT5 except as a part of NT52 in an earlier production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the NT numbering. Let me check each line carefully. The first line is S->NT9 NT5. Then, looking for NT5, I don't see any NT5 listed elsewhere except in the right-hand side of other productions. So perhaps NT52 is derived from NT9 and NT5, but then NT5 isn't defined as a non-terminal elsewhere. That seems like an error because in a CFG, each production must have non-terminals on the left. If NT5 isn't a non-terminal, it's treated as a terminal, but in the given grammar, all except the few have long NT symbols. So I'm unsure.\n\nAssuming that NT5 is a typo and should be something else, maybe NT93 or NT15, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the production is correct, and NT5 is a terminal symbol that somehow appears. But in the provided string, there are terms like 't5', which correspond to NT5 eventually. Wait, but if NT5 isn't a non-terminal, then it must be a terminal, which contradicts the use of it in the grammar.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Since the string starts with t5, which must come from a production like NT5, but the grammar doesn't have NT5, maybe the production is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the NT5 is a typo for NT6 or something else. But without knowing, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S->NT9 NT5 is correct, but NT5 is a non-terminal that must derive to 't5'. In the grammar, looking for NT5*, do we have any production that leads to 't5'? For example, looking through the productions, I see NT5-> 't25'? Wait, no, actually, the lines show:\n\nNT25 -> 't12'\n\nWait, no, looking back, for each non-terminal, the terminal rules are in the form NT<number> -> 't' + number. Let me scan the list:\n\nLooking at the productions where NT is a non-terminal, for each, the right-hand side is 't' followed by a number and sometimes other NTs.\n\nFor example, NT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT15-> 't4'\n\nNT22-> 't15' or 't9' depending on the production.\n\nWait, the key here is to find a way to get 't5' from some non-terminal. Looking at the string, the first symbol is t5. So which non-terminal can produce 't5'? Looking through the endings, none directly produce 't5' except perhaps NT5, which isn't present. Therefore, I'm stuck because there's no NT that directly produces 't5'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a production where a non-terminal produces 't5'. For example, perhaps there's a production like NT13 -> 't4' or NT9 -> 't2', but not 't5'. So, perhaps 't5' is not derivable from any of the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nGiven this, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar because the first symbol 't5' can't be derived from any of the non-terminals in the given grammar. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because each production is either A -> BC or A -> a. That means each step in the derivation is straightforward.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT9 and NT5. So the initial expansion will involve NT9 and NT5. Let me look at the productions for NT9 and NT5.\n\nNT9 seems to produce NT35 NT6. From previous instances, NT36 can produce t something, but I'm not sure. Wait, in the given string, 't20' appears once, and 't41' is also there. I think I need to track how these terminals are derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is to construct the derivation tree step by step. Since the string starts with 't20', I should see where that terminal comes from. Looking at the productions, NT55 produces 't20' from the grammar. So 't20' is from NT55.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with 't20', so that must come from NT55. Let me trace back where NT55 comes from. Looking at NT80 -> 't26' and NT80 is in the grammar, but NT80 isn't directly connected to the start. Wait, perhaps I should look for where NT55 is derived from.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see NT55 -> NT43 NT79. So NT55's derivation would go through NT43 and NT79. Similarly, 't41' is a terminal. Let me check where that comes from. The productions include NT56 -> NT36 NT95, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I see NT44 is produced in some place, but perhaps in the string, 't41' is another terminal.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the string as a series of terminals separated by spaces. Each of these corresponds to a derivation from a non-terminal.\n\nStarting with S, which produces NT9 and NT5.\n\nFirst production: NT9 -> NT35 NT6.\n\nFrom NT35, let's see: NT35 -> NT42 NT87, but then NT42 -> NT12 NT56, and so on. I'm not sure if this will lead to 't41' and 't20'. Maybe I should look at the entire string.\n\nLet me list the terminal symbols in order: t20, t41, t5, t2, t2, t25, t15, t40, t15, t6, t10, t12, t34.\n\nWait a minute, the fourth symbol is 't5'. From the grammar, where does 't5' come from? Looking at the productions, I see that NT85 -> 't4', NT82 -> 't6', and others. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, wait, in the given grammar, the only place where 't5' appears is in NT45: NT85 -> 't4', but that's not 't5'. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT55 -> 't20' and several other non-terminals. Wait, is 't5' an terminal? Or maybe it's another non-terminal. Looking through the productions, I don't see 't5' being a terminal; all the terminals are 't' something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the string again: t20 t41 t5 t2 t2 t25 t15 t40 t15 t6 t10 t12 t34.\n\nAh, I see, the third symbol is 't5', which might not be a terminal. That suggests that 't5' is a non-terminal symbol, so it must be derived from some production. But looking through the grammar, I don't see an NT5 producing 't5'. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me check the grammar again. The grammar's terminal symbols are all the 't' strings, like 't20', 't41', etc. Non-terminals are all others. So, for example, NT55 -> 't20' because NT55 can produce a terminal. Similarly, NT26 -> 't14', and so on.\n\nSo, in the string, each 't' symbol comes from a non-terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each derived from some non-terminal.\n\nSo, the string is t20 (from NT55), t41 (NT?), t5 (NT?), t2 (NT?), etc.\n\nWait, but to get 't5', that would have to be produced by a non-terminal. Let's check the grammar. Do we have any non-terminal that produces 't5'? Looking at the productions, I don't see any NT5 in the rules that lead to a terminal. The closest is NT52 and others, but none of them produce 't5'. So perhaps there's a typo, but I think the string is correct as given.\n\nWait, so 't5' is a terminal. Let me check again. Looking through the given grammar, is there any rule where 't5' is a terminal? For example, NT25 -> 't25'? No, that's a non-terminal. Hmm, perhaps 't5' is a typo. But the string given has 't5' as a terminal. So, if the grammar doesn't produce 't5' as a terminal, then the string cannot be generated. But looking further, I see that NT82 -> 't6', NT84 -> 't5', so maybe 't5' comes from NT84.\n\nWait, in the string, 't5' is the third symbol. So if 't5' is a terminal, it must come from NT84. But I don't think 't5' is a terminal, it must be a non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the string. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at NT4 -> 't35', which is a terminal. So, yes, some non-terminals produce terminals. So 't35' is a terminal, for example.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT25 -> 't25', so NT25 produces the terminal 't25', but that's only one production.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have 't25' appearing as a terminal. So, that must come from a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to work backward. Starting from the string and seeing if each part can be derived.\n\nSo, the string is:\nt20 t41 t5 t2 t2 t25 t15 t40 t15 t6 t10 t12 t34.\n\nLet me try to build this step by step.\n\n1. Start with S => NT9 NT5.\n   So, we have two branches: one for NT9 and one for NT5.\n\n2. Let's focus on the first part of the string to see how it can be derived. The first symbol is 't20', which comes from NT55, as per the production NT55 -> 't20'.\n\nWait, the initial NT9 branches produces NT35 and NT6. Wait, perhaps not. Let me get this straight.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree. Alternatively, since the string starts with t20, which comes from NT55, I need to see if the rest of the string can be derived from the same NT55.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S, which is NT9 and NT5. So, 't20' could be part of one of those branches. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the order.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built from NT9 first, then NT5. The T20 might come from NT55 is part of the NT9 expansion. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a context-free grammar, perhaps the problem is better approached by checking the entire string against the grammar, looking for possible derivations. \n\nBut since this could take a while, and I need to conclude quickly, perhaps I should notice that the string has 't5' as a terminal, which I don't see being derived from any production. Looking through the grammar, there's no production where a non-terminal directly produces 't5'. For example, NT84 -> 't5' is a terminal. So, 't5' must be from NT84. Then, we need to see if the rest of the string can be derived from the same NT84.\n\nBut in the initial step, S splits into NT9 and NT5.

However, in some cases, terminals can be part of the RHS, especially for single terminals. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some rules have terminals as part of their RHS. For example, NT2 -> 't24' means that NT2 can be replaced by the terminal 't24'. That's important because it affects how strings are derived. \n\nThe target string is a sequence of terminals: t4, t37, t40, t26, t10, t3, t34, t37, t31, t36, t3, t34, t2. So, I need to see if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S. Since it's in CNF, every step of the derivation increases the number of symbols, so the string must be built by expanding symbols until only terminals remain. The length of the string is 13, which is 2^3 + 1, but let me check what the derivation tree would look like.\n\nEach production in CNF can produce at most a string of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to produce a string of length 13, the derivation tree must be such that each non-terminal breaks down into two symbols until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me count the number of symbols in the string: 13. Since each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols (each non-terminal can expand into two symbols), the depth of the tree isn't directly clear, but maybe I can think in terms of steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see which non-terminals correspond to each terminal in the string and see if they can be connected in a valid way.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string in order:\n\n1. t4\n2. t37\n3. t40\n4. t26\n5. t10\n6. t3\n7. t34\n8. t37\n9. t31\n10. t36\n11. t3\n12. t34\n13. t2\n\nWait, that's 13 terms. Hmm. So, starting from S, which has S -> NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols are NT9 and NT5. But in the string, the first symbol is t4. So NT9 must expand into t4 and something else. Let me check NT9 productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT9 has several productions. Let me compile all NT9 productions:\n\n- NT9 -> NT53 NT5\n\nWait, no, the grammar is provided as a list, so I need to check each line.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nWait, I need to find which NT9 productions are present. Let me scan through the list:\n\n- NT93 -> ... \n- NT95 -> ...\nBut looking for NT9:\n\nLooking at the list, I don't see NT9 directly. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me scan the list.\n\nWait, here are the rules:\n\nLooking for NT9:\n\n- NT93: ... \n- NT95: NT10 NT11\n- NT79: NT2 NT16\n- NT69: NT88 NT26\n- NT93: NT16 NT5 (Wait, wait, let me see the full list):\n\nThe lines are:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\n\nNT79 -> NT2 NT16\n\nNT69 -> NT88 NT26\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\n\nWait, yes, there's NT93 -> NT16 NT5. So NT93 can produce NT16 and NT5.\n\nBut in our case, the first terminal is t4. So if S expands into NT9 and NT5, then maybe NT9 can produce t4 or something else. Wait, but in the list, I don't see NT9 on the left-hand side except in NT93.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all NT9 productions again.\n\nLooking at the full list:\n\nNo, the only NT9 is in the first set of NT93.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering all the lines correctly. Let me scan again:\n\nLooking for NT9 in the list of non-terminals.

In CKNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and S starts with S -> NT9 NT52. Each of these NTs has further productions until we reach the terminals, which are labeled as 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string starts with t20. Let's see where t20 comes from.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which usually simplifies parsing because each production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules and the string. The string consists of a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t35, t15, etc. The grammar rules seem to map these 't' codes to various non-terminals. For example, NT78->'t40' means non-terminal NT78 is replaced by 't40'.\n\nI'll start by trying to map the string back to the non-terminals using reverse engineering. Each 't' code corresponds to a specific non-terminal. So, for each token in the string, I'll note which non-terminal it represents:\n\nt35 \u2192 NT78\nt15 \u2192 NT22\nt36 \u2192 NT8\nt41 \u2192 NT60\nt12 \u2192 NT49\nt6 \u2192 NT26\nt12 \u2192 NT49\nt8 \u2192 NT16\nt8 \u2192 NT16\nt9 \u2192 NT93\nt4 \u2192 NT10\nt31 \u2192 NT43\nt35 \u2192 NT78\nt15 \u2192 NT22\nt2 \u2192 NT...\n\nWait, I'm seeing a pattern: the string is a sequence of t-codes. Each 't' token must come from a specific production rule in the grammar. To generate the string, the entire sequence must be derived starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, S\u2192NT9 NT5, which are two non-terminals. So each S derivation splits into NT9 and NT5, each of which can be further expanded.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual t-codes and see how they can be formed.\n\nThe string is: t35, t15, t36, t41, t12, t6, t12, t8, t8, t9, t4, t31, t35, t15, t2.\n\nEach of these corresponds to specific non-terminals. Let's list them:\n\n1. t35 \u2192 NT78\n2. t15 \u2192 NT22\n3. t36 \u2192 NT8\n4. t41 \u2192 NT60\n5. t12 \u2192 NT49\n6. t6 \u2192 NT26\n7. t12 \u2192 NT49\n8. t8 \u2192 NT16\n9. t8 \u2192 NT16\n10. t9 \u2192 NT93\n11. t4 \u2192 NT10\n12. t31 \u2192 NT43\n13. t35 \u2192 NT78\n14. t15 \u2192 NT22\n15. t2 \u2192 NT2 (since the last token is 't2', which must be NT2, which according to the grammar has NT2\u2192't2').\n\nSo the entire string corresponds to the sequence of NTs: 78,22,8,60,49,26,49,16,16,93,10,43,78,22,2.\n\nNow, I need to check if these non-terminals can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo NT9 must derive to the sequence starting with 78, which is NT78. Looking at the grammar, NT78\u2192NT51 NT95. Then NT51 and NT95 must derive to something. Let's see NT51 and NT95.\n\nNT51's production is NT10\u2192NT84 NT25. Wait, NT51 is not directly a production; looking back, in the grammar, NT22\u2192't15' is a terminal production, but for NT51, the only production is for NT10\u2192NT84 NT25. Hmm, perhaps I need to track where each NT comes from.\n\nWait, maybe breaking it down step by step:\n\nWe need to check if each non-terminal can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to see if the sequence of NTs can be generated by the productions.\n\nBut this might be too time-consuming. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form and all terminals are atoms (i.e., single characters), and the entire string is a series of these 't' codes, each corresponding to a specific NT, I can try to find a derivation path.\n\nGiven that the string starts with t35, which is NT78, and according to the grammar, NT78\u2192NT51 NT95.\n\nSo NT78 must be split into NT51 and NT95.\n\nNow, NT51 can be expanded into NT10\u2192NT84 NT25.\n\nWait, no: Looking at the grammar rules, NT10\u2192NT84 NT25 is one of the productions. So if NT51 needs to derive something, but wait, in the grammar, NT51 is not directly a production. Wait, the grammar has entries like NT52->..., but I'm looking for NT51. Checking the grammar, I don't see NT51 directly, but maybe it's derived from another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an error here. Let me check the grammar again. The grammar has production rules starting with NT9, NT52, etc. I'm looking for NT51 production, but I don't see it in the given rules. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, the grammar provided starts with S -> NT9 NT5. Then in the rules, NT52, NT84, etc., are defined. But I don't see any NT51 rule. Did I miss it? Let me look through the grammar.\n\nNo, I don't see a production for NT51. So if NT51 is part of the derivation, how can that be? That suggests that perhaps the string cannot be generated because at some point we need to use NT51, which isn't in the grammar. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the grammar is structured.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT51 is part of NT22, such as in rule NT22\u2192something, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT51 as a target; the rule is NT22\u2192't15' as a terminal production. Wait, no, the grammar includes NT22\u2192't15' as a production, which is a terminal production. So NT22 is a terminal non-terminal, which produces 't15'.\n\nSo in the string, the second token is t15, which is NT22. Therefore, NT22 is part of the derivation. But in the first token, we have t35, which is NT78, and NT78\u2192NT51 NT95. So NT78 must generate NT51 and NT95, but NT51 is not defined in the grammar. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier in mapping the tokens. Let me double-check the token list and the mappings.\n\nThe string is: t35 t15 t36 t41 t12 t6 t12 t8 t8 t9 t4 t31 t35 t15 t2.\n\nSo:\n\n1. NT87 (since 't35' is NT78, which is a terminal production? Wait, no: NT78\u2192't40', so t35 must be from NT78\u2192't35' would be a terminal production, but I don't see that. Wait, no, in the grammar, each 't' token corresponds to a specific non-terminal, but if a non-terminal has a production that is a single terminal, like NT2\u2192't6', then that terminal is produced directly.\n\nLooking again, I need to check for the mapping of each 't' token. For example, if a non-terminal NT52 can produce 't6', that's a terminal production.\n\nWait, the mapping for each 't' token is as follows:\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 't' code corresponds to the NT on the left side of a terminal rule.\n\nFor example, NT26\u2192't25', NT25\u2192't25', and so on.

{"custom_id":"request-253","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t35 t20 t10 t40 t4 t3 t14 t34 t3 t2 t31 t5 t37 t41 t34`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should recall how the Chomsky Normal Form works. CNF is a production form where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps in simplifying the parsing process, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol, which in this case seems to be S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So any string generated by this grammar will start with two parts separated by a space, corresponding to NT9 and NT5. Let me check the string: the first two tokens are t35 and t20. Wait, no, the string starts with 't35', but the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which would translate to something like [something] [something else]. So in the string, the first two parts need to be the results of NT9 and NT5's productions.\n\nLooking at the given string: 't35 t20 t10 t40 t4 t3 t14 t34 t3 t2 t31 t5 t37 t41 t34'. So the first two tokens are t35 and t20. But from the grammar, NT9 has production rules like NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each production step.\n\nWait, actually, I think the approach should be to break the string into parts according to the grammar's structure. Starting from S, we have S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string should start with NT9 producing something that starts with t35, followed by NT5 producing something that starts with t20. But wait, looking at the string tokens:\n\n1. t35\n2. t20\n3. t10\n4. t40\n5. t4\n6. t3\n7. t14\n8. t34\n9. t3\n10. t2\n11. t31\n12. t5\n13. t37\n14. t41\n15. t34\n\nWait, that's 15 tokens. But each step in the grammar seems to produce two non-terminals, which expand into more non-terminals until we get to the terminals. So the string should have pairs of terminals for each level of the grammar. But each non-terminal might produce a single terminal or expand into more structures.\n\nLet me take it step by step. The start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. So the string should start with the expansion of NT9 followed by NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t35, which would come from NT9. The second part is t20, which comes from NT5.\n\nSo first, let's see what produces t35. Looking through the productions for NT9:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nNT22 \u2192 't22'? Wait, no, let's check the productions for NT1.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the productions under NT9, the rules seem a bit mixed. Let me list all the NT9 rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT9 we have:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT1 NT3\nWait, no, let me check the given grammar properly. The user listed the grammar with all the productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, under NT9:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nWait, no, actually, the user's grammar has multiple rules for each NT. Let me try to parse it properly:\n\nThe grammar is a set of productions, each on a line, like S -> NT9 NT5. Then each non-terminal (like NT9, NT5, etc.) has their own productions.\n\nSo for example:\n\nNT9 has:\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n- NT22 \u2192 't22' ? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the user's grammar description, it's a series of lines, each starting with ->, so I need to group them by starting non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n...\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n...\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nNT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52\n...\nWait, I'm getting lost. Maybe I should list all the NT's and their productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can start from the string and see if it can be built by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t35, t20, t10, t40, t4, t3, t14, t34, t3, t2, t31, t5, t37, t41, t34.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so the first token should come from NT9, and the second from NT5. The first token in the string is t35, so let's see if NT9 can produce something that starts with t35.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 seems to have a production rule: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Hmm, let me check. Wait, the user's grammar rules are listed with the starting non-terminal on the left, e.g., NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, etc. Let me parse this correctly.\n\nI think it's better to list for each non-terminal the productions. Let's try that.\n\nCollecting all productions by non-terminals:\n\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT5 \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nWait, no, let me go through each line:\n\nLine: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nLine: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nLine: NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\nLine: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (duplicate, maybe)\nLine: NT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26\nLine: NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nLine: NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\nLine: NT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60\nLine: NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56\nLine: NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nLine: NT0 \u2192 NT70 NT80\nLine: NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nLine: NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nLine: NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\nLine: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87\nLine: NT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56\nLine: NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\nLine: NT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27\nLine: NT79 \u2192 NT2 NT16\nLine: NT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27\nLine: NT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30\nLine: NT82 \u2192 NT49 NT9\nLine: NT36 \u2192 NT15 NT69\nLine: NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28\nLine: NT10 \u2192 NT84 NT25\nLine: NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13\nLine: NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96\nLine: NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16\nLine: NT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95\nLine: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\nLine: NT30 \u2192 NT55 NT0\nLine: NT43 \u2192 NT0 NT9\nLine: NT69 \u2192 NT85 NT52\nLine: NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83\nLine: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nLine: NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52\nLine: NT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70\nLine: NT82 \u2192 NT49 NT16\nLine: NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16\nLine: NT81 \u2192 NT8 NT63\nLine: NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\nLine: NT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66\nLine: NT95 \u2192 NT79 NT89\nLine: NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4\nLine: NT81 \u2192 NT4 NT4\nLine: NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88\nLine: NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\nLine: NT8 \u2192 NT39 NT13\nLine: NT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79\nLine: NT64 \u2192 NT15 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in a grammar in CNF, the parse tree will be a full binary tree. Each node is either a non-terminal with two non-terminal children or a non-terminal with a terminal child. Wait, no, that's not right. In CNF, each production is either a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a single terminal. So, each production is strictly left-hand side to two symbols on the right, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, the parse tree for the string will have a certain structure. Since the string starts with `t8`, it must be derived from a non-terminal A where A \u2192 a, so the start symbol S must derive through a series of rules leading to terminals.\n\nLet me look at the production rules for each symbol, specifically focusing on where the terminals appear because each `t` in the string must correspond to a terminal production.\n\nLooking through the rules, many have the form where a non-terminal directly leads to two terminals or another non-terminal. For example, `NT22 -> 't15'` and `NT26 -> 't14'`, so NT22 and NT26 produce terminals directly.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so each component in the string must be produced directly by a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, `t8` must be the result of some NT -> a, and the same for `t9`, etc.\n\nLet me list out the components of the string:\n\nt8, t9, t36, t15, t9, t32, t10, t35, t25, t32, t14, t32, t34, t35, t36, t34.\n\nNow, I need to see if each of these t's are directly produced by some non-terminal in the grammar. So, I'll go through the rules and note which non-terminals produce each t.\n\nLooking for productions where the right-hand side (RHS) is a single terminal. For example, the rule NT22 \u2192 't24' and NT26 \u2192 't14', etc. But wait, when a RHS is a single terminal, that non-terminal can produce that terminal directly.\n\nSo for each t in the string, it's produced directly. So let's see:\n\n- t8 is derived from NT8 -> a? Let's look for NT8 -> 't8'\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n- NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n- NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\n- No NT with a production directly yielding 't8'.\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps I should check the rules again. Let's go through each production:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 a where a is a single terminal.\n\nLet me check all the rules where RHS is a single terminal.\n\nFrom the given rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2' (Wait, checking the rules: \"NT8 -> NT73 NT78\" is the rule, but when looking for terminal-only productions, maybe not.\nWait, no, looking again, the rules are:\n\nNT22 is 't15', yes.\n\nBut looking into the rules, no other single terminal productions. Wait, let me check the entire list again carefully.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (Wait, 't4'? But earlier I thought t4 was from NT15, but perhaps I misread the t in the string. Wait, the string has t32, t14, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each t in the string to the corresponding NT production.\n\nLet's list each t in the string and see what NT produces it directly:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26' (but in the string, t26 would be t26, but in the string, t14, etc.)\nWait, the string uses t8, t9, etc., which are different. So maybe I'm confusing t's here.\n\nWait, no, the t in the string are like t8, t9, t36, etc., so each one must be a direct terminal production.\n\nLet me list each t in the string and try to find a production where RHS is that t.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt8, t9, t36, t15, t9, t32, t10, t35, t25, t32, t14, t32, t34, t35, t36, t34.\n\nSo 16 terminals in total.\n\nLooking for each t:\n\n1. t8: Looking for NT where production is 't8'. Scanning the rules, does any NT directly produce 't8'? Looking at the rules, perhaps not. Because the rules for NT8 are:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT8 is defined as:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I don't see any NT8 -> 't8', same for t9, t36, etc.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, for example:\n\n- NT69 -> NT85 NT52, but then NT85 produces other things.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminal t36 might come from NT36: let's check the rule. Oh, wait, some of the rules have RHS as a terminal and non-terminal.\n\nWait, the rules where RHS is a single terminal:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mistaken. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT10 \u2192 't26', but that's not a terminal in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see if it's covered by any production.\n\nLet's take t8:\n\nLooking at the rules, is there a non-terminal NT where NT \u2192 't8'? I don't think so. Similar for t9. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the grammar has some non-terminals that directly produce these t symbols, which aren't listed in the initial rules here, but I have to check. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t8, which isn't directly produced by any NT, so the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure. For example, looking at NT8:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78.\n\nBut both NT73 and NT78 have their own productions. For example, NT73 is derived as:\n\nNT73 \u2192 't34' NT78.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't34' (is that right?) From the rules:\n\nLooking, yes, \"NT73 \u2192 't34' NT78\".\n\nSo NT73 produces 't34' and something else.\n\nBut wait, 't34' is in the string as t34. So the root production, S, must somehow derive to these.\n\nBut then, going back, the string starts with t8, which can't be produced directly, only through a series of productions.\n\nWait, but maybe I misunderstood the rules. Let me make a more systematic approach.\n\nThe string is t8 t9 t36 t15 t9 t32 t10 t35 t25 t32 t14 t32 t34 t35 t36 t34.\n\nEach of these t's must come from some non-terminal production.\n\nLet me note what options we have:\n\nFor t8:\n\nLooking through the rules where RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- Let's see, there's a NT22 \u2192 't15', but that's for t15, not t8.\n\nSimilarly, looking for t8, is there any NT where A \u2192 't8'? Or is t8 derived from a chain of productions starting from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the production rules.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Each rule on the left side (like S, NT52, etc.) has two non-terminals on the right side. The only terminals are single characters (like t26, t36, etc.), so the parsing should be straightforward.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the production rules step by step.\n\nI think the approach here should be to parse the string top-down using the grammar. Since it's a context-free grammar, I can use a recursive descent parsing method or a stack-based approach. But since I'm just thinking through it, maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't26'. So I need to find which rules produce 't26'. From the grammar, I notice several rules that have 't26' as the result:\n\n- NT22 -> 't24' (No)\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT6 -> 't25' (Wait, no, NT6 is 't25'?)\nWait, let me check the grammar more carefully.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nAnd:\n\nNT25 -> 't25'\n\nSo both NT6 and NT25 produce 't25'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rule NT6 -> 't25' is present. So 't25' is produced by NT6. Also, NT25 -> 't25' is another rule. So for 't25', the possible sources are NT6, NT25, and perhaps others. Wait, but looking through, maybe I need to check all possible NTs that produce 't25'.\n\nWait, the string starts with 't26', so I need to find which NT's produce 't26'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nI see NT5 -> 't35' (No)\nNT22 -> 't9' (No)\nNT26 -> 't14' (No)\nWait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking for 't26', I check all the NTs:\n\n- NT55 -> 't43' (No)\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- Also, NT10 -> 't26' and NT56 -> 't36', etc. Wait, no, the string starts with t26, so which NTs produce t26.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n\nSo the first symbol 't26' can be derived from NT80 or NT10.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, possibility 1: The first symbol is from NT80.\n\nThen, the string must expand as NT80 \u2192 ... ?\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, each rule is two non-terminals. So S -> NT9 NT5. That means S is the top symbol, and the first step is to split into NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, but in the initial parse, S would generate two non-terminals, and each of those would expand into two more, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since the string starts with 't26', it's possible that the entire string is a single NT that directly produces these symbols, but that's unlikely because the grammar seems to only have two symbols per production.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the parsing as a series of steps where each symbol in the string is matched by the production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see which symbols pair up correctly according to the grammar.\n\nSince each production rule in the grammar replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, and each non-terminal eventually must expand to symbols, but when a symbol is a terminal, it can't be expanded further.\n\nSo starting with the entire string, I can think of it as a sequence of terminals that result from expanding the initial S rule.\n\nSo let me outline the possible derivations:\n\nThe string is `t26 t36 t5 t26 t40 t12 t6 t26 t26 t9 t25 t40 t3 t20 t4 t25`.\n\nWe can model this as nodes in a parse tree, each node being an NT or the terminal.\n\nEach production splits the NT into two NTs, so the string is built up in a binary tree structure.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to represent the string as a list and see if it can be reduced through the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to see if the string can be split into pairs that match the NT productions.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see the possible grouping.\n\nFor example, the first 't26' is the result of a NT80 or NT10.\n\nBut in the grammar, the rules that produce 't26' are, for example, NT80 -> 't26'. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar production list, let me check the NTs that generate 't26':\n\nLooking through, I find:\n\n- NT55 -> 't43'\n- NT64 -> 't36'\n- NT91 -> 't9'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\nLooking into the grammar:\n\nLet me parse through all NT rules to see which ones generate 't26' as a terminal:\n\nLooking through each rule on the left side:\n\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT27 -> various t's like t4, t6, t22, etc.\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT55 -> 't20' and 't35'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT64 -> 't36'\n- NT36 -> various t's\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT93 -> various t's (like t7, t13, etc.)\n- NT69 -> 't25'\nAnd so on.\n\nFrom this, the only NTs that directly produce 't26' are:\n\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n\nSo, for the first symbol 't26', the possible NTs are 80 or 10.\n\nLet me consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The entire string is generated starting with NT80.\n\nSo S -> NT9 NT5. But wait, that's S's production: S -> NT9 NT5. So after expanding S, we get NT9 and NT5, and each of those must derive parts of the string.\n\nBut since the first symbol is 't26' (from NT80), how does that fit?\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider that the entire string must be produced by a single NT, but since the grammar's S rule generates two NTs, it's more likely that the parse tree will have a binary structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building a parse tree from the string and seeing if it matches any of the grammar's production rules.\n\nSince the string is `t26 t36 t5 t26 t40 t12 t6 t26 t26 t9 t25 t40 t3 t20 t4 t25`, that's 15 symbols. Since each production splits a non-terminal into two, the parse tree has 15 leaves, meaning the derivation depth is log2(15) ~ 4 levels, but perhaps that's too simplistic.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of symbols and see if there's a way to split it into the appropriate NT pairs according to the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me examine the string:\n\nLooking for pairs of symbols that match any of the production rules where the left side is an NT and the right side produces those two symbols.\n\nFor example, to match NT9 -> NT1 NT9, the two symbols must be NT1 and NT9. But wait, NT9 is a non-terminal, which itself can be split further.\n\nWait, perhaps looking at the string and trying to split it into segments that match the production rules.\n\nLet me try to break down the string:\n\nStarting with symbol 1: 't26'. As discussed, possible NTs are NT80 or NT10.\n\nLet me pick NT80 for the first step.\n\nSo, the first two symbols must be the result of NT80's production. However, looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT80 produces two symbols; instead, NT80 is a terminal 't26'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, RTFM: Looking at the grammar provided, most of the NTs have productions that split into"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars (CFGs) can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CFGs are defined using production rules, and they generate strings by replacing non-terminal symbols with other symbols until only terminals remain. The grammar here is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the starting symbol, which is S and ends with terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that S starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string should start with symbols that can produce NT9 and NT5. Let me check the given string: it starts with `t25`, which is a terminal. So I need to find which non-terminal can produce `t25`.\n\nLooking through the productions, I notice NT25 has a production rule NT25 \u2192 't25'. That's good, so NT25 can generate `t25`. Now, I need to see how the rest of the string can fit into the productions.\n\nThe first part is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So let's parse the string starting after `t25` (since the string is `t25 t31 t5...`, but NT25 is followed by NT9 and NT5 somewhere else. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the order. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two non-terminals are NT9 and NT5. So the string should start by expanding NT9 and NT5. Let me see where `t25` appears. The string starts with `t25`, which is generated by NT25. So I must have a way to get NT25 to produce `t25`, but the initial expansion is NT9 and NT5. Unless NT9 or NT5 can produce NT25 somehow.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I check NT9 and NT5. Let me see:\n\n- NT9 has several productions. For example, NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23. But I don't see NT9 directly producing anything ending with `t25`. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, I should map each NT non-terminal to their corresponding terminal productions. Let me go through each NT symbol and see what they can produce.\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25', that's straightforward.\n\nNT22 has two productions: NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. Hmm.\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT88 \u2192 't26' wait, no. Let me check NT26: its productions are NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25, and NT25 \u2192 't25'. So perhaps NT26 can produce 't25' via NT73 NT25, and NT73 might produce more tokens.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to parse the string step by step, starting from the first token and seeing how each can be derived.\n\nFirst token is `t25`, which is produced by NT25. So the first NT in the derivation would be NT25.\n\nNow, the next part of the string after `t25` is `t31`. So after NT25, the next NT should produce `t31`. Let's look at the productions for NT31. Wait, the NT symbols are all uppercase, and in the grammar, each non-terminal is followed by arrows. Let me check NT31.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT36 \u2192 't15'. Wait, NT31 is not listed as an NT with a terminal production. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure. It's in CNF, so each production is either A\u2192B C or A\u2192 terminal. So any NT that can produce a terminal is directly a terminal production. Let me scan through all the NTs.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't25', NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9', NT6 \u2192 't25', NT15 \u2192 't4', NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25 (so it doesn't produce a terminal directly), NT73 \u2192 't34' (as per NT73 \u2192 't34'), and so on.\n\nWait, let me list all NTs with terminal productions:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9'\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25 (so it can only produce terminals via combination with others)\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking for NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25' \u2192 yes.\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, that's it? Only NT25, NT22, NT6, and NT15 have direct terminal productions. Others produce non-terminals. That's a problem because our string starts with `t25`, which is fine, but the next token is `t31`, which is not a terminal. So unless the production somehow can derive a longer string, this might not be possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the whole string: `t25 t31 t5 t36 t40 t36 t36 t3 t15 t2 t25 t12 t9 t12 t20 t25 t4`. The next tokens after `t25` are `t31`, which is a terminal. But in the grammar, only NT25 produces `t25`, not NT31. So unless NT31 can produce something else.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again. Are there any NTs that produce `t31` directly? Or perhaps indirectly.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing `t31`. So that would mean that the second token `t31` can't be produced by any NT in this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because it can't produce the second token.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me make sure. The start symbol is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two NTs are NT9 and NT5. So the first two symbols of the string should correspond to the productions of NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: several, but let's see. For example, NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23. But none of these are directly terminal, except perhaps if something else.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo after S is NT9 and NT5. So the string should start with the symbols produced by NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet's consider NT9 and NT5:\n\nNT9 has several productions, such as NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23, but that's not a terminal. Alternatively, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11. NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8, but again, not terminal.\n\nWait, maybe NT9 can produce NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8. Then NT28 \u2192 NT10 NT95. Hmm, but I'm not seeing a path to a terminal immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11. Then NT10 can produce 't26' via either NT10 \u2192 NT84 NT26 or NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16. Wait, NT10's productions: NT10 \u2192 NT84 NT26 or NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16.\n\nLet's pick one. Suppose NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16. Then NT26 is followed by NT16. NT26's production is ... Wait, NT26 is followed by NT73 NT25, as per NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25. So NT26 produces NT73 and NT25.\n\nNT73 \u2192 't34', which is a terminal. And NT25 \u2192 't25'. So NT26 can produce 't34 t25'. But that's if NT73 and NT25 directly produce those terminals.\n\nSo if I have NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16, then the production for NT10 would be 't34 t25 t25'? Because NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25 \u2192 't34 t25', and NT16 \u2192 ...

{"custom_id":"request-290","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t9 t26 t5 t25 t15 t4 t2 t24 t31 t5 t36 t15 t4 t15 t9 t26 t6`. \n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. CNF has rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems like all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. That fits CNF.\n\nNext, I'll look at the start symbol, which is S. The initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so S produces two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, I'll break down the target string into its components. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals corresponding to specific non-terminals in the grammar. So the string is:\n\nt9, t26, t5, t25, t15, t4, t2, t24, t31, t5, t36, t15, t4, t15, t9, t26, t6.\n\nI need to find a derivation path in the grammar that exactly produces this sequence.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols must correspond to NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n- The first symbol is t9. So NT9 must produce t9.\n- The second symbol is t26. So NT5 must produce t26.\n\nSo I need to check if NT9 can produce t9 and NT5 can produce t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 is defined as a terminal. Let me check: Yes, it's on the list, so NT9 \u2192 t9. That works.\n\nNow, NT5 is represented multiple times in the rules. Wait, looking at the rules, there's NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, but the rules for NT22 and others... Wait, no, NT5 isn't directly listed. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, in the rules, there's NT52, but NT5 isn't directly a non-terminal. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see rules like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, NT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26, but I don't see a rule for NT5. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check all the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the non-terminals are all the uppercase ones, like NT21, NT22, etc. So the problem is that the grammar doesn't directly have a production for NT5. So if S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and NT5 is not in the rules, except as a part of other non-terminals, then can NT5 exist?\n\nWait, perhaps NT5 is part of another non-terminal. Let me see, the rules are only given, and I need to find a derivation. If there's no rule for NT5, that would mean NT5 can't produce any string, but S can only go to NT9 and NT5, so that would make the string invalid. But wait, that can't be right because S must produce NT9 and NT5, and those must each produce terminal strings.\n\nWait, but looking through the rules, I don't see NT5 being an intermediate node. All the other non-terminals (like NT72, NT36, etc.) have rules, but NT5 is nowhere to be found. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and NT5 isn't a non-terminal with any production, it would mean that it can't produce a terminal string\u2014in fact, it's undefined because there's no rule for NT5.\n\nWait, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe S \u2192 NT9 NT52? Or is there a typo in the rules? Let me double-check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking back, the initial rule is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, as given. So NT5 must be a non-terminal, but nowhere in the rules do I see a production for NT5. So it's undefined, meaning NT5 can't produce anything, which would make the initial production S \u2192 NT9 NT5 impossible, because NT5 can't produce a terminal string.\n\nBut that can't be, because the string starts with t9, which is derived from NT9, so NT9 is present. But for S, which is the start symbol, to produce NT9 NT5, that would require NT5 to be something that produces a terminal or another non-terminal, but since there's no rule for NT5, it's stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me look at the grammar again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check the lines again:\n\nThe rule lines are:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\nNT52 -> NT89 NT35\n...\nOther rules, but I don't see any for NT5.\n\nSo, for NT5, there's no production, which means that NT5 cannot derive any string except for perhaps the empty string, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all rules have two non-terminals, so NT5 wouldn't appear unless it's paired with another non-terminal. Since S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then in the derivation, NT5 must be able to produce a string.\n\nBut since there's no production for NT5, it's impossible. Therefore, the grammar cannot generate the string starting with t9, because S's first step would require NT9 \u2192 t9, yes, but NT5 would have to produce something, but it doesn't, so that production isn't possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm wrong. Could NT5 be part of a larger non-terminal? Let me check the lines again.\n\nLooking through the rules, every line either is a two-nonterminal production or a terminal. So, if there's a line NT5 in the right-hand side, like NT5 \u2192 something, then it's a single step, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, checking further down, I see NT35 \u2192 something else. Wait, maybe I'm missing NT5's production.

{"custom_id":"request-319","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is a bit complex with a lot of productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of t's followed by numbers. Hmm, context-free grammars... let's see if I can break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar. All the productions look to follow the Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each production on the left-hand side (LHS) of the arrow has a length of two symbols as non-terminals or one symbol if it's a terminal, except for the start symbol which might have two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, S expands into two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5. Then, each NT... seems to be another non-terminal that expands further into combinations of other NTs or into terminal symbols (t's and numbers, I suppose). \n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t40 t25 t32 t9 t8 t3 t24 t22 t34 t9 t6 t31 t35 t6 t10 t14 t26 t15`.\n\nEach \"t\" followed by a number seems to be a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of these t-symbol followed by a number. My goal is to trace back through the grammar to see if this sequence can be produced starting from the start symbol S.\n\nI think the approach here is to simulate the derivation starting from S and see if each t in the string can be matched. Alternatively, I might need to see if the entire string can be reduced to the start symbol using the given productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a series of steps, starting from S and expanding, trying to match the t's in the string. Since the string is quite long, it's likely that I can break it down step by step.\n\nLet me think about how the expansions would work. S starts as NT9 NT5. Then, each NT9 and NT5 would expand into other non-terminals. Each time, non-terminal symbols on the left will expand into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nI think the key here is to see if each t in the string can be traced back to a production in the grammar. For example, looking at the t's in the string, each might be a terminal symbol in some production rule.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I notice that some rules directly produce a terminal followed by a number. For example, one rule is `NT22 -> 't34'`. So that's clear: when we expand NT22, we get t34.\n\nBut how does that tie into the string? Let me parse the string as a sequence of t's with numbers. Each token is something like t40, t25, t32, etc.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to match the string token by token, starting from the beginning. So, the first token is t40. Let me check if there's a production that directly gives t40. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- `NT73 -> 't34'`\n- `NT14 -> 't23'`\n- `NT22 -> 't34'`\n- etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see a production that directly gives t40. Wait, is there a production that has 't40' on the RHS? Let me scan through the rules:\n\nLooking at the productions, most of them either produce another non-terminal or a single terminal (like 't's and numbers). Wait, actually, in the given grammar, the productions that produce a single terminal symbol are the ones where the RHS is a 't' followed by a number, or maybe just 't' without. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- `NT2 -> 't6'`\n- `NT6 -> 't25'`\n- etc.\n\nWait, no, I might have misread. Let me go through each production more carefully.\n\nLooking for productions where the RHS is a single terminal symbol (i.e., just 'tX'). For example:\n\n- `NT22 -> 't34'`\n- `NT4 -> 't35'`\n- `NT8 -> 't2'`\n- `NT86 -> 't34'`\n- `NT96 -> 't22'`\n- `NT16 -> 't37'`\n- `NT55 -> 't43'`\n- `NT64 -> 't23'`\n- `NT25 -> 't25'`\n- `NT63 -> 't32'` \u2014 Ah, here's one: NT63 \u2192 t32. So when NT63 is expanded, it becomes t32.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 t14, NT72 \u2192 t35, etc.\n\nSo, to get t32, we need to have a production NT63 \u2192 t32. So if I have to get t32 as the first token, there must be a way for the derivation to reach NT63, which then produces t32.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the starting symbol S, which expands into NT9 and NT5. Then, each of these non-terminals must expand into other symbols that can produce t40 as the first token. Wait, but according to the string, the first token is t40, so maybe that's part of the expansion chain.\n\nBut wait, the string starts with t40. So in the derivation, we must have something that produces t40.\n\nLooking at the productions, is there any rule where the RHS includes t40? Let me scan:\n\nLooking through all the RHS, I'm particularly looking for 't40' as the first token. Hmm, I don't see any production that directly produces t40. So, how can we get t40?\n\nWait, maybe t40 is part of a two-t production, such as NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. If, for example, NT16 is 't37' and NT5 is another symbol, maybe that could result in t40. Or perhaps NT42 \u2192 t24 and another NT that needs to contribute to 40. I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by considering the breakdown of the entire string step by step, trying to see if each symbol can be derived through the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t40 t25 t32 t9 t8 t3 t24 t22 t34 t9 t6 t31 t35 t6 t10 t14 t26 t15.\n\nLet me list these tokens in order:\n\n1. t40\n2. t25\n3. t32\n4. t9\n5. t8\n6. t3\n7. t24\n8. t22\n9. t34\n10. t9\n11. t6\n12. t31\n13. t35\n14. t6\n15. t10\n16. t14\n17. t26\n18. t15\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be generated by expanding S through the grammar rules.\n\nGiven that S starts as S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and then each of these NTs will expand further.\n\nMaybe I can model this as a parsing problem, where each token must be matched by the current rule's RHS. So, for each token in the input, I need to see if it can be produced by any rule, and then the remaining symbols need to follow accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look at the entire expansion and see if it's possible step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string token by token, starting with t40.\n\nBut first, I need to find out if any of the NTs have a production that can yield t40 as their expansion. Looking through the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces t40. So the only way to get t40 is through a production where it's part of a larger expansion, like NT16 \u2192 't37' and then maybe some other part contributes to 40, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should instead look at the entire string and see if it can be generated by the grammar, perhaps by considering it as a series of expansions.\n\nLet me consider the start symbol S. It expands into NT9 and NT5.\n\nNT9 can expand into NT16 and NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-311","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces, so the string is:\n\n`t31 t9 t26 t12 t36 t35 t34 t9 t9 t37 t12 t5 t6 t5 t15 t31 t23 t35`\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. I'll start by looking at the grammar rules and see how they can generate the string. Since it's in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the terminals which are single symbols like 't31', 't9', etc.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the initial expansion starts with these two non-terminals. Each of these NT (number followed by letter) tokens can be further broken down according to the rules.\n\nI notice that each NT has productions that either break down into other NTs or directly map to terminal symbols. For example, NT9 can produce something that leads to 't35', which is part of our string. Similarly, other NTs produce different sequences of terminals or other NTs.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think it would be helpful to represent the string in terms of the NTs and see if there's a way to decompose it step by step. The string has 19 elements, so the parse tree would have a height corresponding to the number of steps needed to reach the terminals.\n\nLet me start by examining the string:\n\nt31, t9, t26, t12, t36, t35, t34, t9, t9, t37, t12, t5, t6, t5, t15, t31, t23, t35\n\nLooking at the terminals, I need to see if they can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar. Each terminal in the string corresponds to certain NT productions. For example, 't31' appears multiple times, which might come from a particular NT rule.\n\nI notice that in the grammar, some NTs directly map to terminals, such as NT4 \u2192 't35', NT25 \u2192 't25', etc. So perhaps I can track back from each terminal in the string to see if it's covered by any NT production.\n\nLet's list out which NTs map directly to the terminals in the string:\n\n- t25: NT25\n- t35: NT4, NT36 (via NT36 \u2192 t41, which doesn't match), wait NT4 is 't35', and NT22\u2192t34, NT6\u2192t25, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, let me correct that:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT36 \u2192 't34'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT14 \u2192 't23'\n- NT87 \u2192 't36'\n- NT93 \u2192 several options, but 't9' isn't directly a production. Wait, does any NT directly produce t9?\n\nLooking through the grammar terminals: Oh, I see NT6 \u2192 't25', NT22 \u2192 't15', t9, etc. Wait, I think I might have missed NT39 \u2192 t22, but that's not t9. Let me check every terminal and see which NTs produce them.\n\nWait, 't9' seems to appear a few times. Looking at the grammar, perhaps NT14 or NT87 or others. Wait, looking back:\n\n- NT14 \u2192 't23', NT39 \u2192 t22, NT73 \u2192 t34, etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed an NT that directly produces t9.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar list:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t15 and t9\nSo the grammar has NT22: NT22 \u2192 t15 | t9.\n\nAh, so 't9' can come from NT22. Similarly, 't26' is produced by NT26 \u2192 't14'? Wait, let me check NT26: NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25, but perhaps in the rules, NT26 has a production that maps to 't14' or something else.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the string has 19 terminals, and the grammar is in CNF, which uses productions of the form A \u2192 BC, the parse tree's height would be log2(n), but perhaps it's linear for longer strings.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use a parsing approach, trying to build the string from the start symbol S, using the grammar rules.\n\nBut with 19 symbols, it's quite long. Let me instead see if each symbol can be matched by some NT production, and if the sequence can be broken down accordingly.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step is to have NT9 and NT5. Let's see what NT9 and NT5 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT9 can produce several things, for example:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 't9', which is one of the 't's in the string, so that's possible.\n- Or NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, which would break into more NTs, but I need to see which leads to 't9'.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 can produce:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't36', which is present in the string, but then we need to see how NT52 is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be derived in order, keeping track of the NTs that generate them.\n\nLooking at the string: t31, t9, t26, t12, t36, t35, t34, t9, t9, t37, t12, t5, t6, t5, t15, t31, t23, t35.\n\nLet me try to decompose this step by step.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT9 NT5\nWe need to generate the first symbol, which is t31. So let's see if NT9 can produce a chain ending in t31.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 t9, but that's not helpful here as we need t31.\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n   Then NT72 \u2192 't35' via NT72 \u2192 t35. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT72's production is not listed here, or perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, the list provided includes NT72 \u2192 't35'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the terminals:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n\nYes, line: NT72 \u2192 t35.\n\nSo if NT72 produces t35, then if NT72 is part of a chain leading to t31, that might not help. Alternatively, maybe NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT13.\n\nWait, let's see NT9's rules:\n\nNT93 \u2192 't9' is another option, but that's not t31. Hmm, perhaps NT9 is generated by another rule, like NT95 \u2192 't79', or maybe NT96.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all possible ways NT9 can produce a terminal:\n\nLooking at NT9's rules:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 't9' or 't6' or 't14' (NT93 has multiple rules, checking the grammar:\n\nYes, NT93 has the following:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\n- NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n- etc.\n\nSo perhaps NT9 can produce non-terminals that eventually lead to t31.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for a chain of NTs that can produce t31.\n\nLooking at NT23, because the last symbol is t23, which is part of the string at the end.\n\nLooking at NT23's productions:\n\nNT23 \u2192 t34 or NT93 NT22.\n\nHmm, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWait, let's approach the string from the start.\n\nThe string starts with t31.\n\nLooking for which NT can produce 't31'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, does any NT directly produce 't31'?\n\nLooking through the list of terminal productions:\n\nLooking for t31.

Each production rule replaces a non-terminal symbol with two other non-terminals or a terminal. Chomsky Normal Form means each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions seem to be in the correct form. The string consists of terminal symbols, so each part of the string should correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nThe grammar's rules have several terminal symbols. For example, NT22 can be 't15' or 't9', NT27 can be 't24', and so on. The given string has t40, t12, t15, etc.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to check if each terminal can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string can be broken down into individual tokens: t40, t12, t15, t9, t8, t24, t14, t12, t6, t25, t3, t25, t9, t37, t41, t8, t8, t2, t26.\n\nWait, let me count them: 19 tokens. That's a lot.

Hmm, but in the string, we have t40. That's a problem. Because none of the non-terminals directly produce t40.\n\nWait, that's a red flag. The string has t40, but checking the rules, I don't see any production that ends with t40 except maybe NT78: Let's check NT78: NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95. Then NT51 \u2192 NT27 NT60. NT27 \u2192 t24. NT60 \u2192 NT12 NT22. NT12 \u2192 t10. NT22 \u2192 t15 or t9. So NT78 would generate something like t24 t24 t10 t15 (but I'm not sure, needs a full derivation). Wait, but the string has t40 as the first element, and no production seems to produce t40 as a terminal.\n\nLet me list all terminals:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides of the grammar rules, the terminals are: t24, t15, t9, t8, t5, t25, t36, t3, t22, t10, t14, t23, t42, t35, t25, t41, t8, t8, t8, t2, t26 (looking at the terminal assignments). So the terminals in the grammar are t22, t23, t24, t25, t35, t36, t41, t8, t5, etc. But t40 isn't listed as a terminal, and I don't see any production rule that directly maps a non-terminal to t40.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, the first few productions produce two non-terminals each. The string starts with t40, which suggests that the first step must produce a rule that ends with t40 as a terminal, but looking through all the symbols, I don't see any production that introduces t40.\n\nSo, since t40 isn't present as a terminal in any production, the string cannot be generated.

The string is `t2 t2 t15 t34 t8 t9 t9 t9 t40 t32 t36 t2 t5 t9 t6 t8 t14 t15 t6`. Hmm, that's a long string of t's with numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that many of the productions do end with a terminal, like NT55 \u2192 't20'. So, each production eventually leads to a terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but the string is made up of terminal symbols: 't2', 't15', etc. So, I need to check if there's a sequence of productions that can derive this string step by step.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: t2, t2, t15, t34, t8, t9, t9, t9, t40, t32, t36, t2, t5, t9, t6, t8, t14, t15, t6.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to look for the top-level non-terminal, which is S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, S must be split into two parts, each of which is derived into a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Let me see what NT9 and NT5 produce.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Then NT72 \u2192 t34 and NT23 \u2192 t15. So, NT9 \u2192 t34 t15.\n\nNext, NT5: NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT6. Wait, looking back, there's NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT6? Or is that NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT8? Wait, the grammar has:\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nNT55 \u2192 't20'\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\nNT53 \u2192 not sure, but let me check relevant entries.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up each non-terminal step by step.\n\nFirst, NT9: It goes to NT72 and NT23. NT72 is a terminal 't34', right? Because looking at NT72 \u2192 't34'. And NT23 \u2192 't15'.\n\nSo, NT9 \u2192 t34 t15.\n\nNow NT5: Looking at the productions, NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT6. Let's see NT26 and NT6.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25. NT73 \u2192 't34'. NT25 \u2192 't25'. So NT26 \u2192 t34 t25.\n\nNT6: Looking at NT6's productions. There's NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16. NT83 \u2192 't35'. NT16 \u2192 't37'. So NT6 \u2192 t35 t37.\n\nWait, but wait, the production for NT5: I thought NT5 \u2192 NT26 NT6, but looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking back, I think I might have misread. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nSo NT26 \u2192 t34 t25.\n\nAnd NT6 is a separate non-terminal. Looking at NT6, do I have any productions?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT26 NT6 is not present. Hmm, perhaps NT5 has a production like NT5 \u2192 something else. Wait, the provided grammar has:\n\nLooking at the list, I see entries like NT55 \u2192 NT13 NT79, etc. But for NT5, in the grammar, does it have a production?\n\nWait, no, looking again, the grammar seems to have various NTs, but maybe some are missing. Let me check NT5:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I don't see NT5 directly. Let me check the list of productions:\n\n- NT52 appears, NT35 appears, etc. So it seems NT5 is not defined, unless it's a typo. But wait, the S production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So NT5 must have a production.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT5. But checking further, maybe I missed it. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through all the NTs, I don't see NT5 defined. Hmm, that's a problem because S \u2192 NT9 NT5, but if NT5 isn't defined, then perhaps that's an error. Or perhaps NT5 is a typo and should be another NT. Maybe I missed a production.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The grammar is provided as a list, but each line is a separate production. Let me check each NT.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT4 \u2192 't34'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT8 \u2192 't73 t78'\n- And so on.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. There is NO NT5 defined in the grammar. Wait, the productions start with S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Wait, that can't be; no, wait the initial S line is: S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So maybe I misread the initial line.\n\nWait, let me check the initial grammar again:\n\nThe first line is S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nThen the next lines are various NT productions.\n\nWait, that changes things. So S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So NT5 in my initial thought was wrong. It's actually NT52.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what NT9 and NT52 produce.\n\nNT9: Let's look. The grammar has NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that's NT93, not NT9.\n\nWait, checking:\n\nLooking at all NTs:\n\n- NT9's productions: I don't see NT9 directly; perhaps it's part of an NT number. Wait, in the grammar, each NT is like NT2, NT4, etc. So maybe NT9 is actually written as NT90, or perhaps it's another number. Wait, the first line is S \u2192 NT9 NT52, so I'm getting confused. Let me list all the NTs present:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NTs are like NT52, NT53, etc. But I don't see NT9 defined as a single NT. So perhaps NT9 is another NT. Wait, no, maybe NT9 is part of the same structure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse the string step by step. Let's try to see if the string can be generated by looking for possible terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t2, t2, t15, t34, t8, t9, t9, t9, t40, t32, t36, t2, t5, t9, t6, t8, t14, t15, t6.\n\nEach 't' is a terminal, and the numbers are non-terminals. So for each 'tX', it must be directly derived from some production, or via a chain of productions.\n\nFor example, t2 could come from a production that immediately is 't2', but looking at the grammar, 't2' is from NT63 \u2192 't32'? Wait, no. Let me check where 't2's come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that 't2' is produced by NT8 \u2192 't2'. Wait, NT8's production is: NT8 \u2192 't2' NT38. Or is it?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, the lines are:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\n- NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28\n- NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\n- NT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66\n- NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96\n...\n\nWait, perhaps 't2' comes from NT26 \u2192 't25' and other NTs. I'm getting tangled up. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar.\n\nLet me start by trying to derive the first token, t2.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that produce 't2'. From the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't2' NT38. So NT8 \u2192 't2' followed by NT38.\n\nBut to produce 't2' directly, I need a production that immediately results in 't2'. Looking through, I don't see any NT directly producing 't2'. So the first step must involve NT8 \u2192 't2' followed by something.\n\nSimilarly, the next token is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-350","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a way to structure CFGs where each production is either A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or maybe S \u2192 \u03b5 if starting symbol can generate empty strings. But in this case, looking at the productions, none seem to be A \u2192 \u03b5 except possibly at the end when a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t15 t6 t24 t31 t24 t6 t20 t9 t37 t41 t37 t31 t24 t25 t32 t25 t20 t9 t10 t2`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like the non-terminals are represented by letters like S, N, T, etc., and some have productions that lead to other non-terminals, while others are directly mapped to terminals and some specific strings.\n\nI remember that Chomsky Normal Form requires each production to have two non-terminals or a single terminal. Also, sometimes it's normalized where the start symbol is separated, but in this case, the start symbol is S because the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, looking more closely, all productions are of the form X \u2192 YZ or X \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So this is definitely Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nThe goal is to parse the string or find a way to derive it from S step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the structure of the grammar. Since all productions are in CNF, each production steps down the string by breaking it into parts. Each step in the derivation corresponds to a non-terminal expanding into two other non-terminals or a terminal, but wait, in this case, some productions replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals, others with a single terminal or a fixed string of terminals.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the given rules:\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5\nThen NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nNT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nNT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\nand so on.\n\nSo for each non-terminal, they have one or more productions, either breaking down into two non-terminals or a sequence of terminals. For example, NT22 can go to 't15' or 't9' or 't34'.\n\nThe string we're testing is t15 t6 t24 t31 t24 t6 t20 t9 t37 t41 t37 t31 t24 t25 t32 t25 t20 t9 t10 t2.\n\nLet me count the tokens. It looks like it breaks down into 20 tokens, so the string has 20 segments. Since each production in CNF, except when expanding to a terminal, can produce two non-terminals, the length of the string in terms of terminals should be a power of 2, but if the grammar allows for non-merging (leftmost or rightmost derivations), the exact length isn't directly applicable.\n\nWait, no, because S is initially broken into two non-terminals, then each of those can further split, so the string would be built by a binary tree of splits. But in this case, some non-terminals split into a mix of non-terminals and terminals, which complicates this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to try to build a parse tree or a derivation from S to see if the string can be obtained.\n\nI'll start by looking at S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the entire string must be built from NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts: the first part is all tokens starting from 't15' and so on until the last half.\n\nWait, but the entire string is 20 tokens. If S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then the string is formed by NT9 followed by NT5, but with each of those non-terminals being expanded further into more tokens. So each non-terminal could be splitting into smaller parts, so the overall string is a binary tree of expansions.\n\nLet me think about how each step could produce the string. Let's attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string must be NT9 NT5.\n\nNT9 has production: NT72 \u2192 NT42 NT35, etc. Wait, looking at the grammar rules for NT9, I think I might be mixing symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar is given with various non-terminals like NT9, NT52, etc. Wait, actually, the letters in the non-terminals seem jumbled. Let me clarify.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\nWait, so NT9 is present in NT93's production. So perhaps I should map all terminals to their respective outputs.\n\nWait, another approach: the grammar's non-terminals have terminal symbols written as 't' followed by a number.\n\nLooking back, in the non-terminals, some symbols are mapped directly to 't's. For example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't73', 't25', 't20'\n\nWait no, looking at the rules:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't73', 't25', 't20'\n\nWait, that would make NT26 \u2192 't73' as one option, but in the given string, I see 't6' and other 't's, so perhaps I got that wrong.\n\nWait, wait, looking through the production rules, let me list each non-terminal and what they produce:\n\nNT22: 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nNT26: 't73', 't625', 't20'? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the rules provided are:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't73', 't25', 't20'\n\nWait, no, let me recheck. Looking at the grammar given:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT22 -> t15, t9, t34.\n\nWait, let me list each non-terminal and what their productions to terminals are.\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT22: t15, t9, t34 --> So three ways to go to a single terminal.\n\n- NT26: t73, t25, t20.\n\n- NT8: t73, t13.\n\n- NT6: t25, t16.\n\nWait, no, looking through the provided rules:\n\nLet me go step by step through the production rules of NT22, NT26, etc.\n\nFrom the list provided:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34' \u2192 So NT22 can produce any of these three t-s.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't73', 't25', 't20'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't73', 't13'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25', 't16'\n\nOk, moving on. Perhaps building a parse tree can help. So starting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, let's look at what NT9 and NT5 can generate.\n\nFrom the grammar, let's look for NT9 and NT5:\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see a direct production for NT9 except one of the rules. Wait, reviewing the given rules, I don't see NT9 as a non-terminal that produces something; instead, NT93 has a production involving NT9. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and also NT93 appears in other productions like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35.\n\nWait, let's check NT93's other productions: NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42, which seems to loop back.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me ensure that the structure is correct. Maybe the initial step is that S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and each of those can produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to write out the entire tree to see.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of symbols and see whether the number makes sense.\n\nSince each S \u2192 NT9 NT5, if each of those NTs produces two things, the number can grow exponentially.\n\nBut the given string has 20 tokens. Let me see if 20 can be represented as a binary tree of splits. Hmm, 2^4 is 16, 2^5 is 32.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string we need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. The string we need to check is `t32 t10 t5 t3 t35 t26 t34 t15 t12 t22 t8 t22 t32 t32 t24 t3 t37 t9 t24 t37`. It looks like a sequence of \"t\" followed by numbers, which are likely terminals from the grammar.\n\nIn CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So, every step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two others or a terminal. The string's length is 20 tokens, but each \"t\" might correspond to a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals waiting to be expanded.\n\nI notice that terminals are words starting with 't' followed by a number. Let's list them by position:\n\n1. t32\n2. t10\n3. t5\n4. t3\n5. t35\n6. t26\n7. t34\n8. t15\n9. t12\n10. t22\n11. t8\n12. t22\n13. t32\n14. t32\n15. t24\n16. t3\n17. t37\n18. t9\n19. t24\n20. t37\n\nMy goal is to check if there's a derivation from S that produces exactly these terminals in order, possibly with intermediate non-terminals that eventually resolve to these terminals.\n\nI'll start from the beginning of the string and try to map each \"t\" to a production.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo the first two non-terminals produced are NT9 and NT5. But in our string, the first terminal is t32. I need to see if either NT9 or NT5 can produce t32.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT95 is defined as NT10 NT11, and NT10 is 't26' and NT11 is something else. But looking for t32, I need to find a production where a non-terminal that can eventually lead to t32 is part of the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 | NT89 NT82. Wait, actually in the provided rules, there are many NT rules. Let me list the relevant ones:\n\nLooking for NT** that can produce a terminal 't32'. Wait, in the given rules, the only way a non-terminal becomes a terminal is if there's a production like NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', etc. Wait, actually I think I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nAh, some rules have 't' followed by numbers as terminals, e.g., NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9', NT23 \u2192 't36', etc.\n\nSo, for instance, NT22 can derive t15 or t9. Similarly, NT35 can produce t37. NT55 can produce t20. So, terminals are these 't' words.\n\nBut in the string, the first terminal is t32. So I need to find which non-terminal can produce t32.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT definitions that include 't32'.\n\nLooking for rules that have 't32' as a terminal:\n\nIn the given grammar, NT83 \u2192 't34', NT36 \u2192 't41', etc. I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't32'. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through each rule carefully:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT27 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't42' or 't37'\n\nWait, wait. Wait, looking back, the user listed a lot of rules. For example, let me see:\n\nNT87 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, but 't32' is not directly a terminal in any of the given rules. That could mean that perhaps t32 isn't a terminal. Maybe it's a non-terminal that eventually resolves into terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is t32, which suggests that at the first step, the grammar must produce t32 from some non-terminal. But if there's no production for a non-terminal that leads directly to t32, then the string cannot be generated because S starts with NT9 NT5, and perhaps those don't lead to t32.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking for the rules. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking for 't32' as a terminal:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production where a non-terminal is defined as a terminal with t32. However, for example, NT56 \u2192 't36', NT35 \u2192 't37', etc. So it's possible that t32 is not a terminal but part of non-terminals. But the first token in the string is t32, which suggests it must be a terminal. So perhaps the grammar does have a production where some non-terminal leads to t32.\n\nWait, let me re-express the rules again:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal ends with 't32'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT87 \u2192 't36' so no\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't21' ?\n\nWait, let me re-express the rules more clearly:\n\nLooking through each rule in the grammar provided:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n\nNT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT27 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't73' or 't2'\n\nLooking for 't32' in any of the rules, it seems that none of the non-terminals directly produce t32. So that suggests that t32 cannot be a terminal, but in the string, the first token is t32, which would mean our initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar rules and overlooked a production where a non-terminal leads to t32.\n\nWait, let me check all the rules again:\n\nLooking through the list of rules:\n\nIs any of the production rules ending in t32?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9'\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't36'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't42', 't37'\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't12', 't56'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't60', 't81'\n\n- NT69 \u2192 't85', 't52'\n\n- NT78 \u2192 't51', 't95'\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't56'\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check again. I see that in the given rules, every non-terminal either splits into two non-terminals or a single terminal as per CNF. So, in the string, each token (like t32, t10, etc.) must correspond to a non-terminal at some point that produces that terminal.\n\nBut looking at all the rules, 't32' is not present as a terminal. So I'm confused because t32 appears in the string, which starts with t32. That would imply that the first step must produce t32 as a terminal, but there is no rule for that. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar, right?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again to make sure I didn't miss any.\n\nLooking through the provided rules step by step:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9' \u2192 no t32.\n\n- NT23 \u2192 't36' \u2192 no.\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't34'\n\n- NT35 \u2192 't42' or 't37'\n\n- NT36 \u2192 etc.\n\n- NT42 \u2192 't12', 't56'\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't60', 't81'\n\n- NT56 \u2192 't36'\n\nWait, no, t36 is from NT56?

{"custom_id":"request-373","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, except for the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. The start symbol here is S.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t14 t32 t37 t41 t32 t9 t31 t4 t12 t23 t36 t6 t8 t24 t9 t20 t32 t15 t8 t8 t35\". It looks like each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the numbers are part of the non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. So in the grammar, all the right-hand sides are either a single non-terminal or two, but in this case, the production rules are all of the form NT followed by two other NTs or terminals. Hmm, no, wait, looking again: some productions have terminals on the right side. For example, \"NT22 -> 't15'\". That's a production where the right-hand side is a terminal and a non-terminal. But in standard CNF, all productions are non-terminals on both sides. So maybe this grammar is not strictly in Chomsky Normal Form, or perhaps it's a mixed form where some productions have terminals. That's confusing.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's a Left-Hand Side (LHS) with non-terminals, and the RHS can have terminals. But the standard CNF only allows two non-terminals on the RHS, but if the RHS has terminals, that would be a Reduced Form where a terminal is directly derived from a non-terminal. So maybe this grammar allows for some productions where the RHS includes terminals. That would change things, as it allows for more direct derivations.\n\nIn any case, I have to parse the string using this grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. Each terminal in the string must match the RHS of some production.\n\nLooking at each production rule, some of them are terminals followed by non-terminals, like \"NT22 -> 't15'\". So perhaps these are allowed in the grammar, meaning that when deriving, a terminal can appear directly. So for example, if we have a production like NT22 -> t15, then that non-terminal can be replaced by the terminal 't15'.\n\nLet me list out all the productions that have terminals on the RHS:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT86 -> 't34'\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT8 -> 't8'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT64 -> 't23'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT16 -> 't8'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT14 -> 't8'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't31'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT39 -> 't8'\n- NT96 -> 't22'\n- NT11 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT55 -> 't35'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT4 -> 't34'\n- NT88 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n\nWait, but some of these are duplicates or have inconsistent mappings. For example, NT14 appears in two productions: NT14 -> t23 and NT14 -> t8. Similarly, NT16 has two productions.\n\nBut I think each production rule can be used once, so for each terminal in the string, I can check if there's a production where the terminal is on the LHS, and the RHS includes that terminal and possibly other non-terminals that can be filled in recursively.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the string is generated via a series of productions, replacing the non-terminals step by step until we reach the terminals.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the string can be derived.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, I might need to plan how to approach it.\n\nThe string is: t14 t32 t37 t41 t32 t9 t31 t4 t12 t23 t36 t6 t8 t24 t9 t20 t32 t15 t8 t8 t35.\n\nLet me split it into individual terminals:\n\n1. t14\n2. t32\n3. t37\n4. t41\n5. t32\n6. t9\n7. t31\n8. t4\n9. t12\n10. t23\n11. t36\n12. t6\n13. t8\n14. t24\n15. t9\n16. t20\n17. t32\n18. t15\n19. t8\n20. t8\n21. t35\n\nNow, I'll try to break down the string step by step, replacing possible non-terminals with terminals.\n\nStarting with the overall structure of the grammar: S -> NT9 NT52.\n\nSo the start is S, which can be replaced by NT9 and NT52.\n\nSo the initial parse tree would have S at the root, with two children: NT9 and NT52.\n\nSo the first step is: S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nNow, each of these NT9 and NT52 can be further broken down into further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet's look at NT9. What's the production for NT9?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see: NT93 -> NT16 NT5 and others, but looking specifically for NT9:\n\nI don't see a production for NT9 in the grammar provided. Wait, let me scan all the NTs.\n\nLooking through the NTs:\n\nLooking for NT9:\n\nI see NT93: NT93 -> NT16 NT5.\n\nBut NT9 itself doesn't have a production in the list. So if NT9 cannot be further replaced, that would mean it's a terminal, but according to the grammar, it's an NT, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps there are some NTs I missed. Let me go through each production:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11.\n\nWait, let me look at each line:\n\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11. That's NT95.\n\nLooking for NT9: I don't see any production in the provided list starting with NT9. So, perhaps NT9 is a terminal? But that can't be, because in the grammar, each production is supposed to be two non-terminals or a mix of terminals and non-terminals. So maybe NT9 is a terminal, which is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Maybe I should check if any NT9 production is present, but looking through the list, I don't see any NT9 on the left side.\n\nSo that suggests that NT9 is a terminal. Which is at position 9 in the terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has \"t9\", which is one of the terminals. But in the grammar, does any NT result in 't9'? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for where the RHS has 't9', I see:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15' and 't9'\n\nSo NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. Similarly, NT22 is one of the NTs, so it's a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the string, we have \"t9\" in the 6th position, so perhaps that's coming from NT22->t9.\n\nWait, but how would we get t9 as a terminal? We need to have a path in the grammar that gets to t9. So perhaps the initial NT9 is a terminal, and then another NT (like NT22) can produce t9.\n\nBut then S \u2192 NT9 NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-374","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol. The string I'm given is `t2 t26 t23 t12 t24 t24 t9 t34 t2 t40 t6 t8 t2 t4 t41 t24 t10 t32 t35 t5 t25`.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for S when it's the start symbol, which might produce terminal symbols directly. Looking at the grammar rules, they all seem to follow this structure, except for the ones that have terminals on the right side, like the ones under NT... where some rules end with 'tX'.\n\nWait, actually, the grammar's right-hand sides can have either non-terminals or terminals. The structure is that each production is either of length two (two non-terminals) or maybe includes a terminal. But since the start symbol S eventually has to produce all terminals, I'll need to track the derivation from S down to the given string.\n\nThe string starts with t2, t26, t23, etc., all separated by spaces. Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so we don't need to worry about those. The non-terminals are the NT... parts.\n\nI think the approach here is to reconstruct the parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if it can generate the given string. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's efficient to perform a top-down parse or use the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, but given the structure, maybe a recursive descent approach would be better.\n\nAlternatively, I can reverse the string and look for the productions that can derive it step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string's length will help. The given string has 21 symbols, so the number of steps in the derivation should correspond to the length of the string minus one, divided by 2?\n\nWait, in CNF, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, but actually, wait, in standard CNF, it's two non-terminals, but in this case, the grammar allows for terminals on the right side, so maybe each step can introduce a terminal or split into two non-terminals.\n\nBut more precisely, since all productions in CNF have two non-terminals, except when it's a terminal, the derivation from S should have a tree where each non-terminal splits into two non-terminals until terminals are reached. However, the presence of terminals in the productions complicates things a bit. \n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the productions do have terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n- NT4 \u2192 t35\n- NT8 \u2192 t2\n- NT13 \u2192 t31\n- NT28 \u2192 t10\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT73 \u2192 t34\n- NT87 \u2192 t36\n- NT14 \u2192 t23\n- NT96 \u2192 t22\n- NT11 \u2192 t41\n- NT55 \u2192 t43\n- NT56 \u2192 t37\n- NT88 \u2192 t5\n- NT51 \u2192 t20\n- NT42 \u2192 t24\n- NT85 \u2192 t4\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT72 \u2192 t35\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- NT64 \u2192 t23\n- NT49 \u2192 t8\n- NT13 \u2192 t4\n- NT88 \u2192 t5\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT64 \u2192 t23\n- NT27 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t34\n- NT24 \u2192 t24 (maybe not, looking at the rules)\n- Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, some rules directly go to a terminal and a non-terminal, like:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t3 NT6 (wait, maybe I misread, because the way it's written is \"NT95 -> NT10 NT11\". But some have a terminal and a non-terminal, like NT66 \u2192 t3 NT6. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the rules have \"NT66 \u2192 t3 NT6\", which is a terminal followed by a non-terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, but you can also have A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Or is it?\n\nNo, wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. So where do terminals appear? Maybe in this grammar, some of the productions were simplified with the start symbol producing directly some terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar uses the end-of-derivation marker, so the start symbol S can produce the terminal string directly, but in this case, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which are non-terminals, so the derivation continues until it reaches the leaves which are terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that there are rules like \"NT2 \u2192 t6\", which is a non-terminal generating a terminal. So for example, NT2 \u2192 t6, meaning that NT2 can produce the terminal 't6'. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the way to approach this is to see if the given string can be generated by starting from S and expanding non-terminals until we reach the terminals in the string.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string length is equal to the number of non-terminals in the derivation chain.\n\nWait, more accurately, in CNF, each production either introduces two non-terminals (so the number of symbols increases by 1 each step) or, if a production produces a terminal, it doesn't. But since all the given terminals in the string are single symbols, the parsing would be such that each terminal corresponds to a step where a production that ends in a terminal is used.\n\nBut in our case, the string is 21 terminals, which suggests that the derivation must involve 20 steps where non-terminals are replaced, ending with a production that produces a terminal.\n\nWait, but for simplicity, perhaps I can reverse-engineer the string by breaking it down step by step, starting from the end and trying to match the grammar.\n\nLet me start by writing the string without spaces to see the sequence:\n\nt2 t26 t23 t12 t24 t24 t9 t34 t2 t40 t6 t8 t2 t4 t41 t24 t10 t32 t35 t5 t25\n\nWhich is t2 t26 t23 t12 t24 t24 t9 t34 t2 t40 t6 t8 t2 t4 t41 t24 t10 t32 t35 t5 t25\n\nI need to see if this can be generated by the given grammar. Since the grammar is large, I might need to find the possible non-terminals that can produce each of these terminals in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal can be reached by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t6 (so NT2 can produce t6)\n- NT26 \u2192 t14 (from NT26 \u2192 t14) or NT26 \u2192 t14 as a production? Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe rules are written as \"NTx -> NTy NTz\", except for some which have a terminal. For example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t3 NT6\n\nNT22 \u2192 t15 or t9\n\nNT26 \u2192 t14 or t25? Wait, in the given grammar, is it NT26 \u2192 t14, or NT26 \u2192 t14 as a production? Looking more carefully:\n\nThe grammar rules include:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t15\nNT22 \u2192 t9\nNT26 \u2192 t14\nNT26 \u2192 t25\n\nAh, so NT26 can produce either the terminal t14 or t25.\n\nSimilarly, looking for each terminal in the string:\n\nThe last symbol is t25. So the last production before that must be NT26 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo the last part is t25, which comes from NT26.\n\nSo the last step is NT26 \u2192 t25.\n\nBefore that, the second last symbol is t10. So we need to find a production that produces t10.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t26 or t8 or t25.\n\nWait, in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the given rules:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT10 \u2192 t8\n- NT10 \u2192 t25 (but looking at"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

They help in identifying which parts of the string can be derived directly.\n\nFor example:\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT27 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34' (Wait, actually, checking the grammar, NT22 has NT22 -> 't15', 't9', and possibly others, but the exact rules are a bit tangled.

Wait, looking back:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n\nAnd lines like:\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- etc.\n\nNext, I should parse the string step by step, trying to match each 't' part against the grammar rules. Alternatively, I can look for a sequence of non-terminals that, when expanded, would produce the given string.\n\nBut given the length of the string, it might be easier to break it down into smaller parts or see if the entire string can be derived by a series of substitutions.\n\nWait, I notice that the string starts with 't10'. Let's find which non-rule produces 't10'. Looking through, I see NT10 has a production: NT10 -> NT84 NT25. Wait, no, NT10 has a production NT10 -> NT84 NT25?

Let's look through all the rules:\n\nStarting with NT36:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT42 NT87\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT43\nWait, none of these are terminals. Wait, perhaps the production NT36 has NT36 -> 't41'? No, looking back:\n\nLooking in the grammar, the rules that produce terminals are for NT6, NT22, etc., but for NT36, looking through the entire list, I don't see any rule where NT36 \u2192 't...'. So NT36 does not directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the string has a 't31' which might be from NT31, but I don't see any rule for NT31 in the grammar. Hmm, so that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let's go step by step.\n\nThe string is: t10 t6 t24 t6 t32 t22 t3 t26 t31 t15 t20 t15 t20 t36 t15 t36 t41 t26 t5 t24 t25 t22\n\nI need to parse this string as a sequence of terminal symbols. Let's process each token and see if they can be generated step by step.\n\n1. First token: t10\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can generate 't10'. Scanning through the grammar:\n\nI see NT84 -> NT28 NT8, but that doesn't help. Wait, let's look through for any NT rule that ends with 't10':\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't10'. So maybe the first step is to find if t10 is a terminal, which it isn't, because the only terminals are combinations like t2, t3, etc., but 't10' is a single 't' followed by '10'. So perhaps the first non-terminal must eventually resolve to 't10'.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, maybe S can produce a chain leading to 't10'.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at where 't10's might come from. For example, in the grammar, I see NT80 -> 't26', but that's 't26', not 't10'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in looking for 't10'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT directly producing 't10'. So 't10' might not be directly generated, which would mean the string is invalid, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is \"t10\" where 10 could be a combination of steps. Let me think.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, N Ts are non-terminals, and when a non-terminal expands, it's replaced by other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo perhaps, t10 comes from a chain of productions.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can generate 't10. Maybe in the steps, but as I don't see any rule, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, perhaps S starts as S-> NT9 NT5. So S would expand to two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet me explore NT9's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT9 has rules like:\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\nLooking through, I see:\n- NT5 -> 't35' (from NT5 -> 't35'?)\n\nWait, wait, let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nI notice that many NT rules produce terminals when their next expansion leads directly to a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-391","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it makes parsing easier. The string to evaluate is `t31 t23 t8 t25 t4 t20 t20 t15 t15 t2 t23 t3 t32 t26 t15 t36 t37 t12 t41 t6 t25 t4`.\n\nFirst, I should probably parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is rewritten as NT9 NT52. So, the initial expansion should produce these two non-terminals, NT9 and NT52.\n\nLet's break down the string into its components, each separated by spaces. That gives me the sequence:\n\n1. t31\n2. t23\n3. t8\n4. t25\n5. t4\n6. t20\n7. t20\n8. t15\n9. t15\n10. t2\n11. t23\n12. t3\n13. t32\n14. t26\n15. t15\n16. t36\n17. t37\n18. t12\n19. t41\n20. t6\n21. t25\n22. t4\n\nI should map each t to non-terminals. Looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions often lead to terminal 't' and numbers. For example, NT6 is rewritten as 't25', NT8 as 't3', etc.\n\nLet me see: each tX can be matched to a rule where NTX is transformed into that 't' token.\n\nSo, let's start mapping the string:\n\nThe entire string seems to be a sequence of terminals, so ultimately, we need to see if each Non-terminal in the parse can be reduced to these t's.\n\nGiven the structure of S -> NT9 NT52, the string should start with NT9 and NT52 expanding into these 't's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t31. Let's see what rule gives NT31.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT31 is produced by NT93 via NT93 -> NT6 NT14 and then perhaps others, but I don't see an immediate rule for NT31. Wait, NT31 isn't listed directly in the productions, but one of the rules for NT14 is NT14 -> 't23'.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree from the bottom up or look for possible reductions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of terminals that follow certain derivation steps.\n\nWait, another approach: each number in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that generates that terminal. So, each 'tX' is the result of a rule where the non-terminal on the left expands to that t.\n\nSo the first step is to note that the string must be a sequence of such 'tX's, each corresponding to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list the rules that produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't3'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 -> 't73', 't25'\n- NT36 -> 't32', 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT84 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT88 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't72', 't23'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT96 -> 't22'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT52 -> 't36', 't16', etc.\n- And so on.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to map each tX to their possible sources:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt31, t23, t8, t25, t4, t20, t20, t15, t15, t2, t23, t3, t32, t26, t15, t36, t37, t12, t41, t6, t25, t4.\n\nEach of these has a corresponding non-terminal. For example:\n\n- t31 is from NT28 via NT28 \u2192 t10 (but wait, looking at the grammar, NT28 might expand to t10? Or maybe via different productions.\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Maybe I should list which non-terminals generate each 'tX':\n\n- t2: NT26 via NT26 \u2192 't73' and 't25'. Alternatively, NT28 perhaps? Not sure.\n- t3: NT8 \u2192 't3'\n- t4: NT15 \u2192 't4', or NT85 \u2192 't4', etc.\n- t5: NT84 \u2192 't5', NT88 \u2192 't5'\n- t6: NT10 \u2192 't26', etc.\n- t8: NT8 \u2192 't3' doesn't help; maybe NT86 \u2192 't34' doesn't have 't8'. Wait, looking again, perhaps NT89 \u2192 't72' doesn't help. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach will take too long. Maybe a better way is to check if the entire string can be reduced by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each 'tX' must be the result of a production of a non-terminal. So let's create a list of the required non-terminals for the sequence:\n\nThe sequence is:\n\n1. t31 (NT31?)\n2. t23 (NT23\u2192't6')\n3. t8 (NT8\u2192't3')\n4. t25 (NT26\u2192't25')\n5. t4 (NT15\u2192't4')\n6. t20 (NT25\u2192't25', NT80\u2192't26', etc.)\n7. t20 (same as above)\n8. t15 (NT22\u2192't15')\n9. t15 (same)\n10. t2 (from where?) Maybe NT26 \u2192 't25', no. Wait, looking at the production for NT26, it's NT26\u2192 't73' or 't25'. But 't2' is elsewhere. Maybe NT65 or something. Wait, perhaps NT66.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT28 \u2192 't10'; NT66 \u2192 't4'; NT13 \u2192 't31' etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, note that the string starts with t31, which should come from a production of NT31. Looking in the grammar, I see that NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8. But does any NT rule produce 31?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT31, which suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, or maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, actually, let me double-check the grammar provided. Let me list all the rules and their right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT5\n\nWait, no, I think I misread the first part. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nThen we have many rules like:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\n\nNT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\nNT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\n\nNT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLooking through these, I don't see any rules that directly produce 't31'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe t31 is a terminal that comes from NT31, which doesn't exist in the grammar. So perhaps the string cannot be generated because 't31' isn't a terminal in the grammar. But wait, the grammar's non-terminals are all like NTx, where x is a number.\n\nBut in the grammar, all the right-hand sides are either a terminal (like 't2') or combinations of non-terminals. So, each NTx is a non-terminal that eventually expands into some combination, terminating with 't' in lowercase.\n\nSo, is t31 produced by any NTx? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTx that leads to 't31'. Therefore, the first token in the string is 't31', which can't be derived from any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the string is not in the language.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a token 't31', which cannot be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to fit this structure. \n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol, which is S. The productions from S are S \u2192 NT9 NT52 and S \u2192 NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc. But wait, the start symbol S can only produce NT9 NT52, as the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the first step is to check if the string starts with either of these NT9 or NT52.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t40. That would correspond to a production that ends with t40. Let me look through the productions for terminals. From the given list, I see NT23 \u2192 't15', but that's not helpful.

Oh, there's NT78 \u2192 't40' because in the list, NT78 is defined as NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95, and looking at the mappings, NT78 is replaced by 't40'.\n\nWait, no, let's look again. The 't40' must come from a production that ends with 't40'. Scanning through the mappings, I don't immediately see a production that directly produces 't40'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. \n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, starting from the beginning and seeing if I can match each token according to the productions.\n\nThe string starts with t40.

So NT22 can produce 't15', 't34', 't9'. Similarly, NT28 \u2192 't10', 't87', etc.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the string starts with 't40', which isn't directly produced by any single NT, according to the given mappings. Because, in the terminal productions, the only 't' tokens listed are:\n\nLooking through the entire list, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't34', 't9'\n- NT28 \u2192 't10', 't87'\n- NT39 \u2192 't22', 't8'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT55 \u2192 't43', 't79'\n- NT56 \u2192 't36', 't95'\n- NT70 \u2192 ?\nWait, no, in the mappings, NT70 is part of the NTs that have further productions, perhaps ending with a terminal. But looking at the mappings, I don't see any NT directly producing 't40' as a terminal. So perhaps I've made a mistake in looking. Let me re-examine the entire list.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nThe only terminal productions are in the lines ending with 't...', such as:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't34', 't9'\n- NT24 \u2192 not directly, but for example, in NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, etc., but looking for t47, no, I'm looking for t40.\n\nWait, I see that in the mappings, there's \"NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\", which doesn't produce a terminal, but somewhere else:\n\nAh, I see that NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52, etc., but I don't see any NT88 or NT66 producing t40. Wait, looking again:\n\nLooking through all the terminal lines:\n\nWait, for example, NT22 \u2192 't34' is there, but I'm looking for 't40'. Hmmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the production NT87 \u2192 't36' is present. Let me check: yes, there's a line NT87 \u2192 NT56 NT36, so no terminal there. NT36 is a terminal with 't41'.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me cross-check.\n\nWait, the string starts with t40. If the grammar doesn't have a production for 't40', then it's impossible for the string to be generated. Alternatively, perhaps the NT78 \u2192 't40' is a typo or I'm misreading the production.\n\nWait no, in the given mappings, looking at the lines, I don't see any NT producing 't40'. So perhaps the string cannot be generated, making the answer No. But that seems unlikely because the user seems to expect maybe a Yes. So perhaps I need to consider a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t40 is not directly produced by an NT, but through a longer derivation. For example, some NT production might eventually lead to t40 via intermediate steps. But that's complicated, and without seeing how, I can't be sure.\n\nWait, but given that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the derivations are trees where each step produces two symbols. However, given the complexity, maybe it's more straightforward to check if any NT can produce the terminals in the string.\n\nSo, since I can't find an NT that directly produces 't40', perhaps the string cannot be generated, hence the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, I must be careful.

{"custom_id":"request-415","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string can be derived from the grammar.\n\nFirst off, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF has specific rules: every production rule must be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except when B or C is a terminal. Also, there should be no productions with more than two non-terminals on the right side, and the start symbol shouldn't be on the right side either. The given grammar seems to follow these rules, so that's a good start.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see that all the productions except the ones that immediately produce terminals are of the form NT followed by two other symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5 means S can be replaced by NT9 and NT5, which are non-terminals. The more specific productions, like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, follow the same pattern.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t14 t26 t36 t20 t24 t6 t3 t24 t26 t5 t14 t15 t40 t32 t22 t22 t2 t40 t37 t37 t6 t32 t24`.\n\nSince the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, I assume these are the terminals in the grammar. My goal is to see if this sequence can be derived through the grammar's productions.\n\nOne approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for parsing context-free grammars in CNF. The CYK algorithm tries to find the longest possible substring that can be derived from non-terminals and builds up a parse table to check if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, I might manually try to trace the derivations, but with a string of 23 terminals, that could get complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to break this down.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for a way to match the string by breaking it down step by step. Let's see the order of the terminals in the string:\n\nt14, t26, t36, t20, t24, t6, t3, t24, t26, t5, t14, t15, t40, t32, t22, t22, t2, t40, t37, t37, t6, t32, t24.\n\nI think I should start by looking for non-terminals that can produce sequences of these terminals. Let's see what the start symbol S can produce. Looking at the initial production, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So starting from S, it becomes NT9 and NT5. Each of these can branch out further.\n\nWe can represent the string as a series of terminals, which must be the result of some non-terminal productions. So, we need to check if there's a way to generate this entire sequence from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice some non-terminals that directly produce terminals, like `NT22 -> t15`, `NT22 -> t9`, `NT6 -> t25`, and so on. These can be useful as they can generate 't' sequences.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to see which parts of the string correspond to these non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to break down the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nThe first two characters are t14 and t26. Let's see if there's a production that starts with t14 and t26. Looking through the rules, I can't see any production that directly produces 't14' and 't26' directly. But perhaps in the form of NT14 \u2192 some terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT14 \u2192 NT8 and NT23, as well as NT14 \u2192 t23. Wait, in the given grammar, the rules don't seem to have NT14 \u2192 't23' directly. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the provided grammar, I see rules like NT22 -> 't6', 't9', but for NT14, I don't see a production starting with 't'. So perhaps 't14' is produced by some other symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. For example, in the provided grammar, NT14 is defined as NT6 \u2192 't25' etc., but I don't see NT14 itself producing 't14'. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should double-check. I see a line: NT14 -> t23. Yes, here it is. So NT14 \u2192 't23'. So that's a production. So, to get t14, does any NT produce it? Or perhaps 't14' is part of a non-terminal path elsewhere.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT14 is produced as NT6 \u2192 t25, but I'm trying to see where 't14' itself is produced. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing it. Alternatively, maybe 't14' is part of another production.\n\nWait, in the string, the first occurrence of 14 is t14. Maybe the initial production leads to it. Wait, perhaps the initial symbols can be more expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to step through the string and see if each pair of terminals can result from a production.\n\nAnother idea is to write down the string as a series of symbols and see how they can be split into pairs that match the possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or building a parse tree step by step is possible, but with some time constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of the string doesn't allow certain productions. For example, if a production requires NT22 to produce t15 and t9, but the string has t14 followed by t26, which might not connect.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire string:\n\nt14 t26 t36 t20 t24 t6 t3 t24 t26 t5 t14 t15 t40 t32 t22 t22 t2 t40 t37 t37 t6 t32 t24.\n\nThat's 23 elements. Since each production in CNF splits into two symbols, and each is a non-terminal or terminal, the derivation would need to combine them step by step.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each production in CNF splits into two parts, perhaps the number of splits would correspond to the number of terminals being about twice the number of steps. But with 23 terminals, which is odd, but the start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5 gives us two symbols, so each step adds more symbols as the tree deepens.\n\nWait, actually, for a string of n terminals, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree is n -1. So, maybe the length is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me try a different approach: perhaps to model the string as an application of the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if any of the middle parts align with any production rules.\n\nFor example, looking for patterns:\n\nLooking for a sequence that could match NT22: from the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 t15 and t9, or t9 and t15. Let me check if the string has a t9 somewhere followed by a t15. Looking in the string: 't22' is followed by 't22' and 't2 t40'. Hmm, not t9's.\n\nWait, perhaps another part: looking for t26 t5, which is part of the string: ..., t26 t5 ...\n\nFrom the grammar, NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35. Then NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83, and NT35 is another non-terminal. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the rules, I can check for the presence of certain NT symbols:\n\nLooking through the rules, I can see NT56 \u2192 t36, so NT56 can produce 't36'. So if the string includes a 't36', perhaps it's produced by NT56.\n\nLooking at the string, the third element is 't36' followed by 't20'. So perhaps t36 is from NT56, and then we have t20 from another NT.\n\nBut perhaps that's getting too speculative. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to see if any of the non-terminals at the start can lead to this string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to try to represent the entire string as a sequence derived from the non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the grammar is such that each production is binary, so the entire string must have a structure where each split corresponds to a production.\n\nBut with a string of 23 symbols, we can consider that as 22 splits. Each split is a possible point where a binary production takes place.\n\nBut given that, it's quite a lot to process. Another idea is to look for a pattern within the string that can be derived from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or terminals. So, looking at the grammar, it's indeed in CNF because every production is between two symbols on the right side.\n\nThe string is broken down into a series of 't' followed by numbers, like t12, t22, etc. These likely represent terminal symbols, so in this case, each 't' number is a terminal, and others like S, NT52, etc., are non-terminals.\n\nMy approach should be to parse the string starting from the start symbol S, S \u2192 NT52 NT9, so the first two symbols must come from NT52 and NT9. But wait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT52 NT9 NT5. Wait, no, the initial production is S \u2192 NT52 NT9 NT5? Or is it S \u2192 NT52 and then NT9 and NT5? Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nThe first line is S -> NT9 NT5, so S expands into NT9 and NT5. So S produces NT9 NT5. So to produce the string, we have to derive from S to NT9 and NT5, each of which must be expanded.\n\nBut looking at the string, the first symbol is t12. So let me check where t12 is produced. Looking through the grammar, I see that some NT... non-terminals expand into terminals, for example, NT60 \u2192 t12. So perhaps NT60 is the non-terminal that can produce t12.\n\nWait, but to get t12, we need to see if there's a production that directly gives t12.

The string is `t34 t6 t2 t12 t8 t5 t6 t9 t4 t6 t3 t3 t35 t3 t12 t8 t34 t2 t26 t26 t12 t37 t31 t34`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The left-hand side can be any non-terminal, and since the string ends with various terminal symbols (like 't...' and numbers), I think the starting symbol S must derive into a sequence that starts with S and then leads to the given string after several steps.\n\nI think the best way is to work backwards from the string, replacing the terminal symbols with their corresponding non-terminals based on the grammar rules. If I can reduce the entire string to the start symbol S, then the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't34'. Looking through the grammar rules, I see that 't34' corresponds to the production rule NT22 -> 't34'. Also, NT22 can split into 't15' or 't9'. But in the string, the next symbol after 't34' is 't6', which corresponds to NT2 -> 't6'. Wait, but how does 't34' and 't6' come together?\n\nWait, let's see. Wait, each terminal in the string should come from a production rule. Let me list out all the terminal symbols:\n\nt34, t6, t2, t12, t8, t5, t6, t9, t4, t6, t3, t3, t35, t3, t12, t8, t34, t2, t26, t26, t12, t37, t31, t34.\n\nEach of these must correspond to some non-terminal in the production rules. So for each 't...', I need to see which NT it maps to.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT22 -> 't34'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT28 -> 't10' but that's not here. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the string is t34, then t6, then t2, which is NT2 -> 't6'. Wait, perhaps I should first map each terminal:\n\n- t34: NT22\n- t6: NT2\n- t2: NT28 (Wait, looking at the rules: NT28 -> NT51 NT95, but 't2' comes from where? Looking through the rules, 't2' is the production of NT88. Wait, I'm looking for which NT's productions include 't2'.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT88 -> NT21 NT16, and NT21 -> 't15' and NT16 has a production to 't2'. So 't2' corresponds to the terminal produced by NT16. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I'm trying to find NT where a production leads directly to t2. Or see which NTs eventually lead to t2.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I should make a list of mappings from NT to t... I'll go through each rule and note which t... they produce.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (twice)\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT8 -> 't2' (appears multiple times)\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't15' and 't9' (I think that's from NT22's other rules)\nWait, no, wait. Let's look for all occurrences where a non-terminal (NT) maps directly to a 't...':\n\nNT88 -> NT21 NT16, and NT21->'t15', NT16->'t2'\n\nWait, so NT88 can produce t2 via NT16. So 't2' comes from NT88.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT14 -> 't23' (two rules)\n- NT26 -> 't36'? No, wait:\n\nLooking through the rules, NT26 has several productions, but looking for 't36' etc. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should go through each terminal in the string and see which NT it maps to, then work on reducing the string step by step.\n\nSo the string is:\n\nt34 t6 t2 t12 t8 t5 t6 t9 t4 t6 t3 t3 t35 t3 t12 t8 t34 t2 t26 t26 t12 t37 t31 t34.\n\nSo breaking down each 't' symbol:\n\n1. t34: NT22\n2. t6: NT2\n3. t2: NT88 (since NT88 can produce 't2' through NT16)\n4. t12: NT8? Let me check. Looking through rules, NT84->... and NT82->... but I'm not sure. Wait, let me check NT28: NT28->'t10' and also can it produce 't12'? Looking at rules, I don't see NT28 producing 't12'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe 't12' comes from another NT. Checking the rules, I see NT12 is not a terminal but a rule: NT12 -> 't10' and another production. Wait, perhaps I need to look for which NT productions result in 't12'.\n\nWait, perhaps I can create a list of all NTs and the 't' symbols they can produce:\n\nLooking through all the production rules:\n\nNT88 -> NT21 NT16 (and as a result, 't15' and 't2')\n\nNT16 -> 't37' (among other things)\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe a better approach is to start from the first symbol and see if they can be replaced by NTs, then see how those NTs can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to work backwards, using the reverse approach: starting from the string and applying inverse productions to reduce it to S.\n\nEach terminal in the string corresponds to some NT. So for each 't34', it's NT22, which has the production NT22->'t34' plus split into 't15' or 't9'. Wait, looking at the NT22 rules: NT22->'t34' (once), and also NT22->'t9' and 't15', and maybe other productions. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT22: Oh, several rules, but the mapping to t... is only in one production NT22->'t34' and in another, NT22->'t9', but perhaps those 't9's come from other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I should first map every 't...' to their corresponding NT:\n\nFor each 't' in the string, find which NT directly produces it, and then work on replacing those with the corresponding NTs, then try to reduce those NTs further.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck because I don't see a straightforward way. Maybe I can use the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if each symbol in the string can be derived from some NT, starting from S.\n\nWait, S -> NT9 NT52\n\nSo S is derived from NT9 and NT52.\n\nNT9 can produce 't23' via some route, and NT52 can produce 't...'\n\nWait, perhaps stepping through:\n\nLet me see if I can replace symbols step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can build a parse tree starting from S.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see what each NT can produce.\n\nLet me think: The entire string is made up of t's and numbers. So first, each 't' must come from an NT production that produces a terminal. So for each t... symbol, we can trace back to the NT that produces it.\n\nBut this is a bit time-consuming. Let me try to map the first symbol t34:\n\nt34 comes from NT22: production NT22 -> 't34' and also from other rules. Wait, looking at the rules, NT22 has two productions that end in t: 't34' is one of them, but looking through the rules, I think NT22->'t34' is one of them, but also NT22 can split into 't9' and 't15' from other rules.\n\nWait, no, the first rule for NT22 is NT22->'t34', then another rule is NT22->'t9', and another is NT22->'t15'.

{"custom_id":"request-453","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of symbols ending with six 't's followed by some numbers, like `t8 t20 ... t6 t32 t6 t32`. Hmm, wait, no, looking again, the string is `t8 t20 t31 t20 t25 t12 t10 t37 t2 t23 t14 t24 t40 t24 t32 t35 t26 t31 t34 t6 t32 t4 t5 t2 t8`. Actually, it's a series of tokens ending with t8. \n\nFirst, I recall that CNF has productions where each right-hand side is exactly two non-terminal symbols, with the exception of the start symbol which can go to a single non-terminal. So, any production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. This structure is useful because the derivation of a string will have a length that's a power of two relative to the depth of the derivation tree. But wait, the given string length is odd\u2014I count the number of tokens. Let me count:\n\nThe string is: t8 t20 t31 t20 t25 t12 t10 t37 t2 t23 t14 t24 t40 t24 t32 t35 t26 t31 t34 t6 t32 t4 t5 t2 t8. That's 25 tokens. Hmm, 25 is not a power of two, so according to Chomsky Normal Form properties, if the string were derived from a CNF grammar, its length should be 2^k for some k. But 25 isn't a power of two, which suggests that maybe the string isn't generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm confusing Chomsky Normal Form with other forms. CNF allows for the start symbol to go directly to a terminal, but in this problem, I don't see any productions where a non-terminal directly goes to a single terminal except in certain cases, like in the top-level productions. Wait, looking at the grammar, some productions have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT83, etc., and some productions replace a non-terminal with a terminal immediately, like NT95 \u2192 NT89 NT60, NT10 \u2192 't26', etc. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, the productions like NT95\u2192NT89NT60 and NT10\u2192't26' etc. So, some non-terminals directly produce terminals, while others continue.\n\nBut the key point is that in CNF, all productions except for the initial one must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals. However, some non-terminals can directly produce terminals. The question now is, when a string is generated, it's a matter of how many steps we take from the start symbol until we reach terminals only.\n\nEach step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, effectively doubling the number of symbols at that point. But when a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal, the number of symbols doesn't increase. So, the total number of terminals in the string must be equal to the number of steps where a non-terminal was replaced by a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of non-terminals in the derivation. Let's consider each step. Starting with S, which is a single non-terminal. Each production of S (like NT9 NT5) expands it into two non-terminals. So, after the first expansion, we have two symbols. Then each of those could expand further, either into two non-terminals each or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc. It's a bit complex.\n\nBut the key insight from CNF is that the number of symbols in the derived string minus one is equal to the sum of the exponents of the number of steps where non-terminals expanded into two. Alternatively, I think the derivation length (the number of symbols) must be equal to 2^k for some k, but if the string has a length that isn't a power of two, it cannot be generated by a CNF grammar.\n\nWait, no, that's not entirely accurate. Because in CNF, the structure allows for non-adjacent symbols to be terminals, but the number of terminals must equal the number of initial non-terminals plus the number of expansions that result in terminals. Hmm, maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to inspect the given string and see if it can be derived from the grammar step by step. But that might take a lot of time given the length of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reconstruct the parse tree or see if the number of tokens matches the required structure based on the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to note that in the provided grammar, each production of a non-terminal except the terminals can produce two non-terminals. So, the start symbol S eventually leads to two NT symbols, each leading to more NTs, until terminals are reached. But the string given is a series of 't's with numbers attached, which likely correspond to specific non-terminals that have been expanded into a terminal.\n\nBut perhaps I should check if the string can be decomposed into parts that match the grammar's production rules.\n\nLooking at the string: t8 t20 t31 t20 t25 t12 t10 t37 t2 t23 t14 t24 t40 t24 t32 t35 t26 t31 t34 t6 t32 t4 t5 t2 t8.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t8 is the first character. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT6 \u2192 t25, but that's not t8. Let's check where t8 comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see several NTs that produce t's:\n\n- NT56 \u2192 t37\n- NT64 \u2192 t23\n- NT88 \u2192 t5\n- NT96 \u2192 t22\n- NT73 \u2192 t34\n- NT67 \u2192 t ... Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, for example, NT55 \u2192 't20' which would produce t20. So, in the string, we have t20 multiple times. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 't26', so the sixth and fifteenth positions in the string are t26.\n\nWait, but I might need to map each token in the string to a production in the grammar. Let's try to break it down.\n\nBut this could take a long time, especially since the string is 25 tokens long. A better approach might be to calculate the minimum number of steps needed and check if it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider the number of symbols. The string has 25 symbols, which is 2^4 + 1, but 25 is not a power of two (16,32). Wait, 25 is between 16 and 32. So, if the grammar is in CNF, the number of terminals in the derived string must be equal to the number of steps where a non-terminal was replaced by a terminal, which is the depth of the derivation. Since each step doubles the number of non-terminals, except when a terminal is added.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the string has 25 symbols, and 25 isn't a power of two, the string cannot be generated by a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form because the length of strings derived from CNF grammars have lengths that are powers of two. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Some resources say that CNF allows for the start symbol to go directly to a terminal, so the derivation could terminate at depth 0, which would mean the string's length could be 1, which is 2^0. Then, at depth 1, each non-terminal would become two non-terminals, leading to 2 symbols. At depth 2, each non-terminal could become two, leading to 4 symbols, etc. But if a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal before going deeper, the length could be a sum of some powers. Wait, perhaps the total length is the sum of 2^k for various k's.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, all productions except for one must replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals. So, the structure is such that each step either doubles the number of symbols or keeps it the same (if a terminal is produced). But when you eventually terminate all non-terminals into terminals, the total number is determined by the number of expansions where a non-terminal was split into two. \n\nSo, the number of terminals (the string length) is equal to 2^d, where d is the depth of the derivation.

{"custom_id":"request-450","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. CNF means that each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left, and on the right, it can have either one non-terminal or two terminals, right? Looking at the rules, most of them seem to fit this format\u2014each rule has two non-terminals on the left. That's good.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t12 t40 t37 t36 t2 t15 t14 t2 t41 t5 t10 t26 t26 t3 t23 t35 t41 t8 t31 t32 t6 t2 t34 t26 t9`.\n\nWait, but how do terminals and non-terminals play into this? The grammar uses NT with numbers, and then some are converted into terminals using rules that end with ...-> ...<terminal> So, each of these production rules eventually derive into terminal strings or other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but how do I read this string? The string is a sequence of terminals. So each part of the string corresponds to the terminals output by the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, so to check if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding it and matching each part of the string.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the process.\n\nI think I can approach this by working backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can reconstruct the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S, which is the start symbol. The first rule is S->NT9 NT52. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT9 and NT52.\n\nLet me check the string: the first few symbols are t12, t40, t37, t36, t2, t15, etc. So if S expands to NT9 and NT52, the first terminal part should come from NT9, and the second from NT52.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, the productions are for non-terminals, and when you have S->A B, the first terminal in the string would come from A, and the rest from B. So yes, S->NT9 NT52. So the first symbol of the string should come from NT9, and the rest from NT52.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is 't12'. Let's see what rules produce 't12'. Scanning through the terminals, I see that 't12' is derived from NT60 via a production: NT60-> t12.\n\nSo to get 't12', we'd have to have NT60 produce it. Now, looking at the rules for NT60: NT60->NT36 NT56. So NT60 must be derived from NT36 and NT56.\n\nSo the first part of the string is 't12', which is from NT60. So the first part of S's expansion would be NT60, which is NT36 NT56.\n\nWait, but how does this fit into the overall structure? Let me break it down:\n\n1. S -> NT9 NT52\n   - The first symbol comes from NT9\n   - The second symbol comes from NT52\n2. To get 't12', which is the first symbol, it must come from NT60.\n\nSo that suggests that NT9 must expand to NT60, right? Because the first terminal is 't12' from NT60, which is part of NT9.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. S->NT9 NT52. So the entire string is generated by NT9 followed by NT52. So the first part of the string is the expansion of NT9, and the latter part is the expansion of NT52.\n\nSo each time we process a part of the string, we have to consider which non-terminal produces it, and then split that part accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the start symbol in a bottom-up approach might be useful, but given the length of the string, that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a series of steps generated by the grammar. Let me see the string length: 24 tokens. That's a bit long, but let's try to break it down.\n\nLet me list the string:\n\n1. t12\n2. t40\n3. t37\n4. t36\n5. t2\n6. t15\n7. t14\n8. t2\n9. t41\n10. t5\n11. t10\n12. t26\n13. t26\n14. t3\n15. t23\n16. t35\n17. t41\n18. t8\n19. t31\n20. t32\n21. t6\n22. t2\n23. t34\n24. t26\n25. t9\n\nWait, no, the string is 25 symbols. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nString: `t12 t40 t37 t36 t2 t15 t14 t2 t41 t5 t10 t26 t26 t3 t23 t35 t41 t8 t31 t32 t6 t2 t34 t26 t9`\n\nThat's 24 symbols? Let me count: each letter is a token, including the commas. Wait, probably it's 24 tokens. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the string is: t12 t40 t37 t36 t2 t15 t14 t2 t41 t5 t10 t26 t26 t3 t23 t35 t41 t8 t31 t32 t6 t2 t34 t26 t9 \u2192 that's 24 tokens. So 24 symbols to process.\n\nStarting with S, which splits into NT9 and NT52. So the first symbol is from NT9, and the rest from NT52.\n\nSo let's take the first symbol: t12. We need to find a production for NT9 that can derive t12 as part of its expansion.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT9: I see NT93 -> NT16 NT5, but that's not helpful. Wait, wait, I need the non-terminals that can directly derive terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT43\n- NT42 -> NT12 NT56\n- NT60 -> t12\n- NT56 -> t36\n- NT55 -> t20\n- NT26 -> t14\n- NT64 -> t23\n- NT49 -> t8\n- NT73 -> t34\n- NT78 -> t40\n- NT4 -> t35\n- NT6 -> t25\n- NT84 -> t5\n- NT15->t4\n- NT88->t21\n- NT2 -> t6\n\nHmm, wait, let me check more carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT60: NT60 -> t12\n\nSo NT60 produces 't12' as a terminal. So how does NT9 lead into NT60? Let me see if NT9 has a rule that produces NT60 at some point.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT95->NT10 NT11, but that might not help. Wait, where does NT9 lead?\n\nNT95->NT10 NT11 \u2192 Hmm, NT10 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me recheck the rules for NT9. Are there any direct productions that include NT9?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, NT95->NT10 NT11\n\nAnd other rules I don't see NT9 directly. Wait, am I missing any?

{"custom_id":"request-471","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is `t12 t2 t10 t3 t32 t2 t3 t36 t23 t31 t40 t36 t31 t24 t20 t9 t41 t14 t24 t10 t23 t22 t23 t37 t14 t20`. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the terminals are all 't' followed by numbers. The start symbol is S.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. CNF means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a single terminal.\n\nBut looking at the given grammar, I notice that some rules are more complex. For example, I see rules like S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which is in CNF because it's A \u2192 BC. Then there are rules for NT52, NT84, etc., each split into two non-terminals. Finally, many of the non-terminals eventually resolve to 't' followed by numbers. Some seem to have multiple options, like NT69 \u2192 NT85 NT52 or NT69 \u2192 NT86 NT26, etc.\n\nThe string provided has 29 terminal symbols. Let me count the number of 't's: t12, t2, t10, etc. Each symbol is a terminal, so the string length is 29.\n\nIn CNF, the derivation tree is a binary tree with height log2(n), where n is the number of symbols. So for 29 symbols, the number of steps should be around log2(29) \u2248 5 levels, which would require about 2^5 = 32 nodes, meaning about 31 non-terminals. Since some non-terminals might be used multiple times, I need to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence that follows all the rules.\n\nBut manually checking each step would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if all the 't's are being properly expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the non-terminals either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals are 't' followed by numbers, which must be matched exactly.\n\nLet me start by trying to parse the string from the last symbol backward. This could help because terminal symbols are leaves in the derivation tree. Starting from 't20', which is at the end. Let's check if any rule produces 't20'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT22 \u2192 NT21 NT22 and NT55 \u2192 NT22 \u2192 't22' Wait, no. Wait, let me check the rules for 't's.\n\nThe 't' rules are:\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT26 \u2192 't26'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9'\nWait, but in the given rules, some NT symbols are broken down into 't's.\n\nLooking closer:\n\nFor example, NT56 \u2192 't36' is a production. Similarly, NT82 \u2192 't6', and NT73 \u2192 't34', etc. So each non-terminal can either be a two-level production or a terminal.\n\nSo the string must be generated by expanding each non-terminal step by step until we reach terminals.\n\nBut parsing this manually is difficult. Maybe I can look for any conflicts or impossible matches.\n\nFor instance, starting from the left, the first symbol is t12. So I need a rule that can produce t12. Looking for a rule that leads to t12.\n\nLooking through the 't' rules, I notice that NT12 \u2192 't10' and 't12'. Wait, NT12 has a production NT12 \u2192 NT63 NT43. Then, NT63 \u2192 't32' and NT43 \u2192 't35'. So t32 t35 could come from NT12. But the string starts with t12, which isn't a terminal directly. Alternatively, maybe NT43 is involved.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, NT63 \u2192 't32' and NT43 \u2192 't35' is another production. So to get t12 as a terminal, there might be a NT rule that directly produces 't12', but I don't see any. Maybe I'm missing one.\n\nWait, the rules provided include NT66 \u2192 't32', but that's not t12. Hmm. Let me check.\n\nWait, the rules have NT55 \u2192 't22' and NT66 \u2192 't3', but t3 isn't t12. Hmm. Maybe I need to find a production that can derive t12 as a terminal. If none exist, then the string can't be generated, and the answer would be No.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that directly produces 't12' as a terminal. The only 't12' I see is in the string as the first symbol. So to generate this, the initial expansion must involve a non-terminal that eventually produces t12. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT12 is a non-terminal with productions. The first rule is NT12 \u2192 NT63 NT43. So to get t12, we need NT12 to derive to t12. Let's follow that:\n\nNT12 \u2192 NT63 NT43\n\nThen, NT63 \u2192 't32' (a terminal), and NT43 \u2192 't35' (another terminal). So that would be t32 t35. That's two terminals: 't32' and 't35'. So the first two symbols of the string are t12 and t2. That doesn't match t32 t35, so something is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the string. Let me recount: the string is `t12 t2 t10 t3 t32 t2 t3 t36 t23 t31 t40 t36 t31 t24 t20 t9 t41 t14 t24 t10 t23 t22 t23 t37 t14 t20`.\n\nSo the first symbol is t12. If NT12 is expanded to t32 t35, as per its rule, that would give t32 t35. But our string starts with t12, which is different. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated because the first symbol would require a non-terminal that can produce t12, but I don't see such a rule.\n\nAlternatively, am I missing any rules that produce t12?\n\nLooking through all the given 't' rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT22 \u2192 't22'\n- NT26 \u2192 't26'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n- NT55 has another production: NT55 \u2192 't22'\n\nSo no, there's no rule that directly produces t12. Thus, t12 can only be derived if a non-terminal that can eventually produce t12 exists in the grammar.\n\nLooking further, does any non-terminal directly produce t12? It doesn't seem so. So either the string starts with a terminal that isn't produced by any rule, which would make it invalid, or the grammar has some non-terminal that correctly expands to t12.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another path. For example, if some non-terminal X can produce t12 by expanding through other non-terminals. Let me check all the non-terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT2 is 't6', NT3 doesn't seem to have 't3' as a terminal (I think), wait checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, 't3' is in NT66 \u2192 't3', but I don't see any t3 in the string. Wait, no: the string includes t13, which would be from NT13. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nBut in any case, to produce t12, a non-terminal must have a production that includes t12. But in the given grammar, I don't see any 't12' in the 't' rules. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because it starts with t12, which is not derivable from any rule.\n\nWait, am I certain? Are there any other possible ways? Maybe via leftmost or rightmost derivations? For example, starting from S, can it generate a sequence that includes t12 as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at S's production: S \u2192 NT9 NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-477","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the grammar rules and see how they can produce the string. The string to evaluate is: t25 t24 t37 t32 t12 t40 t24 t20 t31 t41 t40 t15 t12 t6 t9 t24 t24 t37 t40 t20 t23 t36 t36 t34 t5 t15.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that many of the non-terminals have production rules ending in terminal symbols. For example, NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9', so NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. Similarly, NT55 -> 't20' and NT10 -> 't26', and so on. \n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived by starting from S and applying the production rules step by step. Let's start from the top-level rule S -> NT9 NT5.\n\nFrom the string, I see that S will probably be split into two parts. Let's look for 't' followed by numbers to see which rules can produce them.\n\nLooking at the first token 't25', I check which non-terminals produce 't25'. From the grammar, NT25 is defined as NT80 -> NT56 NT82, and NT56 -> NT36 NT95, etc. Wait, that might not be directly helpful. Let me check each non-terminal's direct productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n- NT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25' (Yes, NT6 produces 't25')\n- NT25 is used in NT64 and NT4, but let's focus on the direct terminals.\n\nSo, 't25' comes from NT6. So S -> NT9 NT5, and one part is NT9 producing 't25', which is possible since NT6 produces 't25', and NT6 is connected to S somehow.\n\nWait, no, NT9 is a non-terminal. Let's see the rules for NT9:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n- NT93 -> NT79 NT42\n- NT89 -> NT72 NT83\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n- NT70 -> NT82 NT52\n- NT29 is not a thing; wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the production S -> NT9 NT5, so both NT9 and NT5 are initial non-terminals. Let me check what each can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT9's production rules are not directly given as terminal, but perhaps through others. Wait, no, I should check all the rules to see which NT9 can reach terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT95 is an NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT10 is used in some places. Alternatively, perhaps NT9 is part of various non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps starting from S and trying to reach the first token 't25'.\n\nSince S -> NT9 NT5, perhaps the string starts with a production from either NT9 or NT5. Looking for a rule where NT9 or NT5 produce 't25', but I don't see it directly. Alternatively, the first token 't25' could come from NT6, as NT6 -> 't25', which is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a production chain that leads from S down to starting with 't25'. Let's try to find if there's a way to derive 't25' from S.\n\nLooking at the rules, S is NT9 NT5, both of which are non-terminals. To get 't25', let's see what each can produce.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> 't25'. So if either NT9 or NT5 can derive NT6, then that part can produce 't25'.\n\nLooking at NT9's rules: There's a rule NT93 -> NT79 NT42, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, looking at NT6's parents. NT6 is produced by NT27, as NT27 -> 't24', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, let's look for rules that can produce 't25'. From the given rules, the only terminal is 't25' from NT6. So, to get 't25', one of the non-terminals in S must derive to NT6. Let's see.\n\nWait, S splits into NT9 and NT5. So perhaps NT9 produces something that can ultimately produce NT6, and NT5 produces some other parts. Or perhaps NT5 produces 't25' directly, but checking NT5's rules: I don't see a direct production of NT5 to any terminals, except that in other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's easier to reconstruct the entire parse tree. Let's see the string:\n\nt25 t24 t37 t32 t12 t40 t24 t20 t31 t41 t40 t15 t12 t6 t9 t24 t24 t37 t40 t20 t23 t36 t36 t34 t5 t15.\n\nThat's 29 tokens. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so each production is two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the first token is 't25', which is a terminal. So the first production must be a terminal, which in this case is generated by NT6, as NT6 -> 't25'. So, one of the S branches must go through NT6.\n\nSince S -> NT9 NT5, perhaps either NT9 or NT5 is producing NT6, but looking at the rules, let's see:\n\nLooking for NT9 producing NT6. Is there a rule for NT9 that eventually leads to NT6?\n\nLooking through the rules, it's unclear. Let me check all NT9's rules. From the given rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT9 as a terminal, so perhaps NT9 can produce NT6 through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: NT9 can produce NT6 through some rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial S splits into NT9 and NT5, each of which splits into other non-terminals, leading down to terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's easier to try to parse the string step by step, trying to match the rules.\n\nLet's think about the entire string as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production rule. Since each step in the grammar is a production of two non-terminals or a terminal, the string must be constructed by replacing each non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that, the string can be viewed as a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a production. So, each 't' followed by digits is a terminal, and each two NTs connected would form a production.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each token is either a terminal symbol or part of a non-terminal.\n\nBut since the string is given as a sequence of terminals, each must be generated by a rule that directly outputs that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't25'. From the grammar, 't25' is produced by NT6 (NT6 -> 't25'). So, the first non-terminal in the string is NT6. So, that would mean that in the initial production, one of the non-terminals in S must derive to NT6.\n\nBut S -> NT9 NT5. So, for the first token to be 't25', either NT9 or NT5 must produce NT6. Wait, but none of the rules for NT9 or NT5 directly produce NT6. So perhaps the next step is that one of NT9 or NT5 produces another non-terminal that eventually leads to NT6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's consider that the string starts with a terminal, which must correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nLet me try to list all possible terminals and their corresponding NTs:\n\nFrom the grammar, the terminal productions are:\n\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT24 -> 't35' (Wait, no, in the rules: NT24 is part of some production, but for terminals, we have NT12 -> 't10', etc.\nWait, looking through all the rules, I think the only direct terminals are:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n- NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-490","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding what I have.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it's mostly non-terminals, with some terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t36 t36 t8 t10 t14 t6 t41 t9 t10 t12 t35 t41 t14 t6 t37 t3 t26 t2 t25 t20 t4 t5 t4 t14 t10 t14 t6`.\n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar's starting symbol is S, and according to CNF, the start symbol is a non-terminal. So the string should eventually derive from S.\n\nEach production in CNF is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, each step in the derivation will either produce a single terminal or split a non-terminal into two.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals expand into terminals, while others expand into two non-terminals.\n\nI think the best approach is to parse the string from right to left because the rightmost symbol is the first to be considered in the grammar. This is known as the CYK algorithm for parsing, which works efficiently for CNF grammars. Let me try to apply that approach.\n\nThe string is: t36 t36 t8 t10 t14 t6 t41 t9 t10 t12 t35 t41 t14 t6 t37 t3 t26 t2 t25 t20 t4 t5 t4 t14 t10 t14 t6.\n\nLet me count the tokens: that's 30 tokens, so the string has 30 elements. So, the derivation will have 30 steps, each producing one token, starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, no, actually, the length of the string corresponds to the number of non-terminals in the leftmost derivation. But in rightmost, it's similar to the parse depth.\n\nBut maybe I can approach it by trying to match the rules.\n\nEach rule in the grammar is of the form NTxy \u2192 NTab NTcd, etc., except some produce terminals.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can produce a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nGiven the string, I need to see if the entire string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI can create a tree from the string, breaking it down into subparts.\n\nStarting from the right, the last token is 't6'. Let's see which rules produce 't6'.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 't25', which is a rule for NT26.\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nWait, 't6' is directly produced by NT2. So the last token must have come from NT2. So the last part of the derivation is NT2 \u2192 t6.\n\nSo the last part is T2, which is the rightmost occurrence. So we can split the string into everything before 't6' and then 't6'.\n\nNow, the part before 't6' is: ... t14 t10 t14 t6. Wait, let me double-check. The original string ends with ... t6, so I think I may have miscounted. Wait, the string is long, but I'm more interested in the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a table from right to left would be more efficient.\n\nBut given the complexity here, maybe I can try to backtrack.\n\nAlternatively, I can check each symbol from the end to see if there's a possible production.\n\nLet's list the positions:\n\n1: t36\n2: t36\n3: t8\n4: t10\n5: t14\n6: t6\n7: t41\n8: t9\n9: t10\n10: t12\n11: t35\n12: t41\n13: t14\n14: t6\n15: t37\n16: t3\n17: t26\n18: t2\n19: t25\n20: t20\n21: t4\n22: t5\n23: t4\n24: t14\n25: t10\n26: t14\n27: t6\n28: t36\n29: t36\n30: t8\n31: t10\n32: t12\n33: t35\n34: t41\n35: t14\n36: t6\n\nWait, that's 36 tokens, but earlier I thought it was 30. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, the string is: `t36 t36 t8 t10 t14 t6 t41 t9 t10 t12 t35 t41 t14 t6 t37 t3 t26 t2 t25 t20 t4 t5 t4 t14 t10 t14 t6`.\n\nCounting these: each space-separated part is a token.

Getting confused earlier.\n\nThe string is 27 tokens long, so the derivation will involve 27 steps, starting from S.\n\nLet me list the positions:\n\n1: t36\n2: t36\n3: t8\n4: t10\n5: t14\n6: t6\n7: t41\n8: t9\n9: t10\n10: t12\n11: t35\n12: t41\n13: t14\n14: t6\n15: t37\n16: t3\n17: t26\n18: t2\n19: t25\n20: t20\n21: t4\n22: t5\n23: t4\n24: t14\n25: t10\n26: t14\n27: t6\n\nNow, starting from the end, the last token is t6, which must come from a production of the form NTx \u2192 t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the rules that produce t6 are:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t25 (which doesn't directly give t6)\n- Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t6 (from rule: NT2 -> t6)\n- That's the only rule that produces t6 directly.\n\nSo the last symbol t6 must come from NT2. So we split the string into the part before the t6 (all except the last) and t6.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n26 tokens: positions 1-26 (t36 to t14) and then t6.\n\nWait, no: if the last token is 27, then the first 26 tokens are from 1 to 26. So we need to see if these 26 can be formed using a production that ends in NT2, which gives t6.\n\nSimilarly, each time, I'd check the last symbol and see which non-terminal can produce it, then proceed recursively.\n\nLet me try to simulate a rightmost parse.\n\nStart with the entire string as the rightmost part: s = [t36, ..., t6].\n\nWait, it's better to model it step by step.\n\nStep 1: Last symbol is t6, which is produced by NT2. So we need to parse the first 26 tokens as NT2, which is the production NT2 \u2192 t6.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So the only way NT2 can produce t6 is as a terminal. So the entire string must have t6 as the last symbol, which comes from NT2.\n\nSo, the first step is to have the entire string generated by NT2 \u2192 t6.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string we're checking.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and 'a' is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that S is the start symbol, and it goes through various NTX productions until it reaches terminals. Each production seems to break down a non-terminal into two other non-terminals or a terminal, except for some that directly lead to a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t12 t3 t34 t37 t12 t35 t37 t20 t9 t37 t2 t41 t9 t31 t41 t6 t36 t14 t14 t14 t5 t41 t37 t24 t6 t6.\n\nFirst, I notice the structure of the grammar. Starting from S, it splits into NT9 and NT5. Looking at the productions, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So each step splits into two parts, which themselves can split further. The string seems to be a sequence of terminals, all of which are 't' followed by a number. Some of these match the terminal productions in the grammar, like NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83 and then NT72 and NT83 eventually leading to t-something.\n\nI think I'll approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done top-down using the grammar rules, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts and see if they can fit the grammar. I'll write down the string as a list:\n\n['t37', 't12', 't3', 't34', 't37', 't12', 't35', 't37', 't20', 't9', 't37', 't2', 't41', 't9', 't31', 't41', '6', '36', '14', '14', '14', '5', '41', '37', '24', '6', '6']\n\nWait, the last part ends with '6', not 't6', so I've probably miscounted. Let me check the string again. Oh no, I think I made a mistake. The string given is:\n\nt37 t12 t3 t34 t37 t12 t35 t37 t20 t9 t37 t2 t41 t9 t31 t41 t6 t36 t14 t14 t14 t5 t41 t37 t24 t6 t6.\n\nYes, it ends with t6 't6', but looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t25, which is 't25', not 't6'. So the last part should be 't25', but it's 't6' and 't6' again. Hmm, that might be an issue.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string should start with NT9 producing a terminal and NT5 producing another terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t37. Let's see where t37 comes from in the grammar. Looking at the productions, NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83, but NT37 is derived from NT69 \u2192 NT85 NT52, wait no. Wait, the NT productions are all uppercase letters, like NT2, NT3, etc. So the tokens are like 't37', which might be terminals derived from NT37.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, at the bottom, we have:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSimilarly, NT35 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nLooking for t37, let's see the productions. Wait, t37 comes from NT37. Let me find the productions for NT37. Scanning through the grammar:\n\nNT87 \u2192 NT36 NT37\n\nSo, NT87 can produce NT36 and NT37, which then produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, but I don't see NT37 directly defined in the grammar. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, maybe NT37 is derived from NT14? Looking through the productions, I don't see a direct NT37. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27\n\nWait, NT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27, and so on. Hmm, I'm not seeing an explicit definition of NT37. Maybe it's derived from another path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t37 comes from NT37 being derived further. Let me check the productions for NT56, NT69, etc.\n\nWait, in the terminal productions, NT83 can produce 't36' and other things. Let me look for any terminal 't37' in the grammar. Wait, in the list provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, I see:\n\nNT69 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT64 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT35 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, no 't37' in the terminal productions.

That helps because it simplifies parsing. Each production has two parts, so I can think of the string as a sequence of these productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it's made up of 't' followed by numbers, like 't23', which seems to correspond to the 't' productions in the grammar. I should check if there's a valid way to split the string into these t-productions.\n\nLet me list out all the t-productions available in the grammar. For example:\n- NT2 -> 't24'\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT24 -> 't9' (assuming, but checking the provided grammar: Yes, NT24 is 't9')\nWait, in the grammar provided, I see NT22 is 't15' and 't9', NT24 is 't9', etc. So each t-production corresponds to a specific non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of t-terms. Each term must correspond to a single production, so the entire string is a sequence of these t-productions. Since the grammar is in CNF, the entire string must split into a sequence of t-productions without any non-terminals.\n\nLet me check the string:\n\nThe string is: t23 t37 t2 t6 t25 t26 t34 t32 t35 t24 t6 t41 t22 t22 t31 t14 t25 t35 t26 t20 t8 t36 t10 t24 t32 t23 t12 t32.\n\nI need to split this into components where each part is a single t-term and matches one of the t-productions.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the t-terms:\n\nt23, t37, t2, t6, t25, t26, t34, t32, t35, t24, t6, t41, t22, t22, t31, t14, t25, t35, t26, t20, t8, t36, t10, t24, t32, t23, t12, t32.\n\nNow, check each term:\n\nt23: Does any non-terminal produce t23? Looking through, I see NT22 can produce t15 or t9. Wait, I'll check the grammar more carefully. For example, NT22 is in two places: `NT22 -> 't15'` and `NT22 -> 't9'`. So t23 isn't a terminal; perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, no, the grammar as provided lists multiple t-productions, but in this case, I think each t corresponds to specific non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify: Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol in the language. The grammar defines how non-terminals can expand into these terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production either goes to a terminal (like t23, t37, etc.) or splits into two non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the provided grammar, I see lines like `NT22 -> 't15'` and `NT22 -> 't9'`. So the non-terminal NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. Similarly, NT23: Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT23 as a non-terminal. Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, looking through the grammar, I see some terms like NT23: no, the first production is S -> NT9 NT5. Looking for NT23, but I don't see it in the given grammar. So perhaps there is no production for NT23, which would mean that the string has 't23' but there's no NT23 in the grammar, so it can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each production in the grammar and see if 't23' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through, the terminal productions (the ones ending with 't...') are things like:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9'\n\nNT24 -> 't9'\n\nNT2 -> 't6', 't2'\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT8 -> 't2'\n\nNT73 -> 't34'\n\nAnd so on. I don't see 't23' as a terminal, so that suggests that 't23' can't be produced by any terminal, so the string includes 't23', which isn't a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated because 't23' isn't a valid terminal.\n\nWait, but the provided grammar doesn't have 't23' as a terminal, only certain nt's produce t's. So perhaps 't23' isn't in the language, making the string invalid.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, the string starts with t23. If 't23' is a terminal in the grammar, there should be a production like NT23 -> 't23'. Looking through all the entries, I don't see that. The closest is NT22 -> 't15' and 't9', but nothing for NT23.

{"custom_id":"request-516","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, each starting with 't' followed by numbers. The grammar's non-terminal symbols (NT) are defined through production rules, and some of these symbols are transformed into terminals ('t' followed by numbers) in the end.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where each right-hand side (RHS) is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since the given grammar is in CNF, every production is of the form NT \u2192 NT NT or NT \u2192 terminal.\n\nThe given string is: `t6 t34 t20 t26 t10 t22 t22 t10 t24 t10 t22 t26 t25 t20 t22 t10 t4 t36 t20 t24 t35 t14 t40 t40 t31 t9 t36 t32`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's look at the grammar production rules and see if any of the terminals in the string match the RHS of the non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, many of the non-terminals directly produce a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n- NT72 \u2192 t35\n- NT70 \u2192 t82 and t52, which then are terminals.\n\nWait, I'm seeing a lot of 't' terms being generated by some non-terminals. Let me try to map each 't' in the string to see which NT rules produce them.\n\nLet me list each token in the string and see if any NT rules produce it.\n\nThe string has the following tokens:\n\nt6, t34, t20, t26, t10, t22, t22, t10, t24, t10, t22, t26, t25, t20, t22, t10, t4, t36, t20, t24, t35, t14, t40, t40, t31, t9, t36, t32.\n\nWait, the string has 30 tokens. So the derivation will involve 30 production steps, starting from S and expanding to the string. But this seems too long, but let me try to find a pattern or possible way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards by trying to find if each token can be matched to an NT production.\n\nWait, but the grammar has direct matches for several 't's. Let me look for tokens that correspond to NT's that produce them.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT10 \u2192 t26\nNT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\nNT25 \u2192 t25 (from NT25 \u2192 't25')\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT25: There's one rule, NT25 \u2192 't25'.\n\nSimilarly, NT26: NT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nLooking at each token, perhaps I can find which NT's produce them.\n\nLet me scan the list:\n\nt6: Is there any NT rule that produces 't6'? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT36: NT36 \u2192 NT55 NT0, and NT55 could be a terminal?\n\nWait, looking for NT that directly produce 't6':\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78 and directly NT8 has some rules, but none seem to produce 't6'.\n\nWait, let's go one by one:\n\nCheck if any NT directly expands to t6:\n\nLooking for an NT where RHS is a terminal that equals 't6'.\n\nLooking through all terminal rules:\n\n- NT70: one rule is NT70 \u2192 t78.\n\n- NT10: NT10 \u2192 t26.\n\nNo, none seem to produce t6. Wait, is there any NT rule producing 't6'? Let me look back.\n\nWait, the list of rules has:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\n\nLooking, perhaps there's no NT that directly produces t6. Then, for t6 to appear, it must come from two non-terminals. So the immediate production would be something like NT... \u2192 ... where at least one step before expands into t6.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's double-check: in the given grammar, do any of the non-terminals directly produce 't6'? Looking through each NT rule:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't72'\n\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't34' (from NT24 \u2192 't34')\n\nLooking at all terminals: no NT directly produces 't6'.\n\nTherefore, t6 must appear as a result of expanding a non-terminal. Let's see if any NT rule's RHS includes 't6'.\n\nWait, for t6 to be in the string, it must be produced by some NT. But if no NT directly produces 't6', then we need the t6 to be generated via a non-terminal that expands into 't6'. Wait, but perhaps a tree can have two steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this as a parse tree, trying to see if each step can match the tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for the structure of the string. Let's see if the string can be built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar. Let's try to find for each token whether it's a terminal or a non-terminal generated from the rules.\n\nWait, but t6 isn't generated directly, so perhaps it's part of a non-terminal that can expand into it.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for a production rule where t6 is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a non-terminal generating t6. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I don't see any NT rule that directly produces 't6'. Therefore, t6 must be part of a non-terminal's expansion. But since the grammar is in CNF, all expansions are two symbols or terminals. So to get 't6', there must be a non-terminal NT that can produce 't6' via a two-step production.\n\nWait, but each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, if t6 is to appear, it must be part of a production that directly produces a terminal. But since there's no direct rule, maybe it's not possible. That would mean that the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\nNT26 \u2192 't4'\n\nBut is there a rule for something like NT... \u2192 something leading to 't6'? Hmm.\n\nWait, let's consider if any production produces t6 as a result of combining non-terminals. For example, maybe a non-terminal like S leading to some NTs that, when expanded, produce the needed tokens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t6 is part of a non-terminal that is involved in a production. But without a direct rule, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to think about the possible length of the generated string. In CNF, each step of production increases the length by one. The start symbol S breaks into two NTs, each of which can break into two more, and so on. So, the number of symbols in the generated string should be 2^n, where n is the number of steps.\n\nWait, let's calculate the length of the string. It has 30 symbols. Wait, 30 is not a power of 2 (since 2^5=32, which is more, and 2^4=16, which is less). So perhaps the string is of incorrect length if the grammar is in CNF, but the user states that the grammar is in CNF, and the string is what is given. If the length isn't a power of two, that would mean it's impossible to derive.\n\nWait, 30 is not a power of two. 2^5 =32, which is more than 30. 2^4=16, which is less. So 30 isn't a power of two. That suggests that the string can't be generated by a CNF grammar.\n\nWait, but wait: perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the productions are such that each step either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of symbols in the string (excluding the number of steps) increases by 1 each step.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, the length of the string is 2^n where n is the number of steps, but I think the starting symbol S is in the derivation, and each expansion doubles the number until terminals are reached.\n\nBut if the string has 30 symbols, then 30 = 2^k, but 2^5=32, which is more than 30, so it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-535","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens: `t31 t3 t23 t15 t15 t15 t26 t32 t37 t32 t9 t35 t22 t40 t5 t5 t37 t4 t34 t20 t20 t40 t22 t26 t34 t32 t12 t25 t36`.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for a CFG in CNF. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the type A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The provided grammar seems to fit this pattern, as all productions start with a single non-terminal on the left and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right.\n\nThe string starts with a 't' token, which must correspond to one of the productions that generate terminals. Looking at the grammar, there are several rules that start with 'NT' and end with a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', so 't15' is a terminal that can be produced from NT22.\n\nSince the string starts with 't31', I need to check if there's a production rule that starts with NT and ends with 't31'. Looking through the list, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 also has another rule NA22 \u2192 't34' (though this might be a typo, as the actual rule is NT22 \u2192 't15' and another instance is missing here). Wait, looking again, I notice that in the grammar, NT22 has rule: `NT22 -> 't15'`, but I also see in the rules that NT22 has `NT22 -> 't15'` in two instances, perhaps indicating some error. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, let me parse the rule for NT22. Looking through the provided rules, I don't immediately see a production for NT22 ending with 't31'. The rules show that NT22 has `NT22 -> 't15'`, and another instance for `NT22 -> 't15'` under NT22. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps there's a rule like NT73 \u2192 't31', which would suggest that NT73 can produce 't31'.\n\nLooking back, I see in the grammar, there's a rule: NT73 \u2192 NT87 NT36. That doesn't help. Wait, NT73 appears elsewhere: let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I should go through the steps systematically. The string is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' must correspond to a single-character rule in the grammar. So let's see if the sequence is possible step by step.\n\nThe first token is t31. Let's check if there's a rule that produces t31. Scanning the grammar, I see NT73 \u2192 NT87 NT36. But that's not a terminal, so that's not the case. Alternatively, looking for any rule that produces 't31' directly. Looking through the 'productions of terminals' section, I see 't31' being generated by NT73? Wait no, because all of NT's are in the grammar. Wait, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the rules like NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT15 \u2192 't4' and NT26 \u2192 't25' etc. Let's see. I think I need to list all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (duplicate)\n- NT22 appears elsewhere as a non-terminal, but as a terminal, perhaps. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for example, the line says:\n\n`NT22 -> 't15'`\n\nAnother entry says:\n\n`NT22 -> 't15'` again.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe there's another terminal that produces 't31'? Because the string starts with 't31', which I need to find a rule that ends with 't31'.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again, under NT73, there's a production: `NT73 -> NT87 NT36`, which is not a terminal. So, no, that doesn't produce 't31'.\n\nLooking for any NT that can produce 't31' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- NT51 \u2192 't20'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n- NT23 \u2192 't31'\nAh! Here's one: NT23 \u2192 't31'. So NT23 produces 't31'. Therefore, 't31' can be produced from NT23.\n\nSo the first token in the string is 't31', which comes from NT23 \u2192 't31'.\n\nNow, the next token is 't3'. Let's check if any NT can produce 't3'. Scanning the terminal rules, I see:\n\nLooking for a rule like NTxyz \u2192 't3'.\n\nLooking through the list: I don't see any terminal productions ending with 't3' except maybe NT13 \u2192 't36' or other. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, the terminal rules are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT88 -> 't5'\n- NT13 -> 't36'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT64 -> 't23'\n- NT26 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (twice)\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n- NT95 \u2192 't79' and 't89' etc., none of those end with 't3'.\nWait, looking again: in the terminal rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT26 \u2192 't25'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (maybe not)\nWait, perhaps I'm missing one.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a NT that directly produces 't3'? Or perhaps the string is not possible.\n\nWait, the string starts with t31 (NT23) followed by t3. But in the terminal rules, there's no NT that produces 't3'. Therefore, the next token 't3' cannot be produced by any rule in the grammar, so the entire string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because I might have missed a rule.\n\nIn the grammar, under the terminal rules, I see NT73 \u2192 NT87 NT36. NT73 is a non-terminal, but not a terminal itself. So no, that's for non-terminals.\n\nWait, another place: looking through the rules again:\n\n- I see NT23 \u2192 't31' (so t31 is produced)\n- I don't see any rule producing 't3' directly.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated because the second token 't3' isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-556","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that structure makes the rules relatively straightforward. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, which simplifies parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t9 t2 t26 t37 t4 t6 t14 t15 t32 t37 t24 t31 t41 t36 t32 t41 t3 t24 t8 t10 t26 t3 t32 t36 t31 t35 t26 t32 t15 t5`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It consists of a start symbol S and a series of non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT84, etc.) that eventually derive terminals (like 't' followed by numbers). Each rule is broken down into either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the non-terminals are directly linked to terminals. For example, NT72 \u2192 't24', NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9', NT27 \u2192 't24', and so on. So this is likely a straightforward parse where each non-terminal is replaced by a sequence of terminals.\n\nThe strategy I'll use is to work backwards from the given string, trying to match the right-hand sides of the non-terminals until I either cover the entire string or get stuck.\n\nStarting with the initial production S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string starts with 't9'. According to the grammar, NT9 is defined as \u2192 NT72 NT23. So 't9' comes from NT72 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT72 \u2192 't24', which is the terminal, and NT23 \u2192 't35' according to the grammar. So far, the string starts with t24 t35. But wait, the string starts with 't9', which corresponds to NT72 NT23 \u2192 't24 t35'? Wait, no, NT9 is divided into two non-terminals, so it's the concatenation of those two non-terminals, which would then be replaced by the corresponding terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should break the string down step by step.\n\nThe string is: t9 t2 t26 t37 t4 t6 t14 t15 t32 t37 t24 t31 t41 t36 t32 t41 t3 t24 t8 t10 t26 t3 t32 t36 t31 t35 t26 t32 t15 t5.\n\nLet me index each part for clarity:\n\n1. t9\n2. t2\n3. t26\n4. t37\n5. t4\n6. t6\n7. t14\n8. t15\n9. t32\n10. t37\n11. t24\n12. t31\n13. t41\n14. t36\n15. t32\n16. t41\n17. t3\n18. t24\n19. t8\n20. t10\n21. t26\n22. t3\n23. t32\n24. t36\n25. t31\n26. t35\n27. t26\n28. t32\n29. t15\n30. t5.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string starts with 't9 t2', which corresponds to NT9 (t24) and NT5 (t2), because NT9 is derived from NT72 and NT23, but wait, wait. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, no. Wait, NT9 is defined as NT72 \u2192 't24' and NT23 \u2192 't35', so S \u2192 NT9 NT5 would translate to t24 t35. But the string starts with t9, so that doesn't align. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. NT9 is one of the non-terminals, so S \u2192 NT9 NT5 would expand to whatever NT9 and NT5 are. But if NT9 is 't24' and NT5 is 't2', then S would produce 't24 t2', but the string starts with 't9 t2', which doesn't match. That suggests that maybe I'm misapplying the rules. Alternatively, perhaps I need to look deeper into how NT9 is derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the production NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, and then NT72 \u2192 't24', NT23 \u2192 't35', so S \u2192 NT9 NT5 \u2192 (t24 t35) (t6 t25) because NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT14 \u2192 't25' from NT6 and 't14' \u2192 't14' perhaps, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by building the string backwards. Let's see the end of the string: it ends with t5. Looking at the grammar, NT5 can be broken down as NT6 NT14 \u2192 't25' and 't15' or 't9'. Alternatively, NT5 could also be derived from other rules. Wait, looking through the productions, I see NT5 is used in several places:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT5 is in several productions: NT22 \u2192 't9', NT21 \u2192 't15', but I don't see a production for NT5 itself except as a part of other non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014looking again, I see that NT5 is not explicitly defined as a terminal. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake because in the grammar given, all terminal productions are listed when I see a non-terminal -> a terminal. So let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar, there are several rules where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal. For example, NT72 \u2192 't24', NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9', NT27 \u2192 't24', NT2 \u2192 't6', NT8 \u2192 't2', etc. So these are the terminal productions.\n\nSo, in the grammar, the non-terminals are NT52, NT84, NT93, etc., and each has a series of rules until we hit a rule that directly outputs a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the terminals in the string are 't' followed by numbers, so I should check if each part of the string can be derived correctly through the grammar.\n\nLet me write out the entire string and see if I can match each part step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\n1. t9\n2. t2\n3. t26\n4. t37\n5. t4\n6. t6\n7. t14\n8. t15\n9. t32\n10. t37\n11. t24\n12. t31\n13. t41\n14. t36\n15. t32\n16. t41\n17. t3\n18. t24\n19. t8\n20. t10\n21. t26\n22. t3\n23. t32\n24. t36\n25. t31\n26. t35\n27. t26\n28. t32\n29. t15\n30. t5.\n\nWait, I think it's better to break the string into chunks according to the grammar. But perhaps a better approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, using memoization or recursive descent parsing, but that might be too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each production in the grammar after a few steps results in a terminal. So perhaps I can use this hierarchy to decompose the string.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo S would be NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, NT9 is defined as NT72 NT23. NT72 is 't24', and NT23 is 't35'. So S would expand to 't24' 't35'.\n\nBut the string starts with 't9 t2 t26...', which doesn't match. So that suggests that either I made a mistake in identifying NT9 or that perhaps the start symbol is not correctly interpreted.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules, do any non-terminals directly correspond to terminals? For example, NT72 \u2192 't24', NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9', NT27 \u2192 't24', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

{"custom_id":"request-558","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break down how I can approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the starting symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, the start symbol appears to be S, and all other non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. However, some of the productions have terminals like 't24', but others have combinations like NT89 NT5 or others. Hmm, I might have misread; maybe some are terminals and some are non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals. Wait, looking again, the NT rules seem to break down into other combinations, and some of them directly map to 't' followed by numbers. So each NT is a non-terminal, and when they can't be broken down further, they're terminals. So in the end, the string is a concatenation of these 't' terms, so the grammar ultimately generates strings of these 't's.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: t10 t5 t8 t20 t31 t2 t10 t2 t31 t36 t24 t6 t2 t8 t6 t32 t15 t31 t34 t4 t14 t6 t4 t4 t36 t3 t41 t23 t40 t31.\n\nLooking at the structure, the string starts with t10, then t5, etc. So I need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I can model the generation as a sequence of steps where each non-terminal breaks down into two other parts, which are either non-terminals or terminals. So to parse the string, I can try to see if each part can be formed by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut parsing this manually might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can look for a way to represent the string in terms of the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that each production in the grammar can generate two parts. The string should be a concatenation of these parts. So, maybe I can build a tree from the string, breaking it down into the components dictated by the grammar.\n\nLet me consider the top-level production S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo S splits into NT9 and NT5. The string should start with the expansion of NT9 followed by the expansion of NT5.\n\nLet's check the string:\n\nThe first part is t10 t5 t8 t20 t31 t2 t10 t2 t31 t36 t24 t6 t2 t8 t6 t32.\n\nThen, the second part is t15 t31 t34 t4 t14 t6 t4 t4 t36 t3 t41 t23 t40 t31.\n\nWait, but the grammar's S production has NT9 and NT5. So I need to see if the first part of the string corresponds to NT9 and the second to NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT14 NT6 (Wait, looking back, I think I might have misread.)\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided is a list of rules.

{"custom_id":"request-578","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and one on the right, except for the start symbol, which has one non-terminal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar and the string we're checking. The grammar has a start symbol S, which produces NT9 NT5. Each non-terminal on the left eventually leads to terminals or other non-terminals that eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t10 t20 t36 t2 t2 t4 t31 t26 t24 t2 t9 t2 t25 t14 t31 t4 t37 t8 t22 t31 t25 t20 t15 t37 t12 t24 t22 t10 t37 t9.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, a recursive descent parser with appropriate lookaheads might work, but maybe a simpler approach would be to trace the possible derivations from the start symbol to see if we can reach the string.\n\nLet's look at the grammar again:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nSo the first symbol should be derived from NT9 and NT5. Each of these non-terminals will produce sequences of terminals. Let's see what each of these NTs can produce.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n\nI see NT9 -> NT72 NT23. Then, NT72 is defined as NT78 NT8, and NT78 is NT51 NT95. Wait, but then NT78 is NT51 NT95, and NT51 is NT27 NT60. Hmm, I'm getting a bit lost. Maybe I should look up each NT in the grammar and see what they lead to.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see what each production of an NT resolves to in terms of terminals. This might take a while, but it's necessary to build the possible strings each NT can produce.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be broken down into segments that match the NT productions. Let's look at each part:\n\nStarts with t10, t20, t36, etc. From the grammar, I see that some NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the start symbol S, it's NT9 and NT5. So the first part of the string should start with NT9, which is t9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t10 t20 t36 t2 t2 t4 t31 t26 t24 t2 t9. Wait, that's 11 symbols. But the grammar's S produces NT9 (which is a single NT) and NT5. Each of these NTs may produce multiple symbols.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the string is a concatenation of 34 symbols. Each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal generated by the NTs. So each NT production chain must lead to a sequence of terminals that matches the string.\n\nLet's check the beginning: t10 t20...\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT25 -> 't25', so maybe NT25 can produce t25. Similarly, NT15 -> 't4'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should see for each terminal in the string, what NT they belong to, and then check if that NT can generate that terminal by a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string corresponds to a particular path in the NT derivation trees.\n\nLet me write down the first few symbols: t10, t20, t36, t2, t2, t4, t31, t26, t24, t2, t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT10 can produce t26. So t10 is the terminal t26, which is produced by NT10 -> t26 (looking at the last rules, I see NT10 -> 't26').\n\nWait, let me check the grammar rules more carefully. For example, in the grammar, some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals:\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT26 -> 't14'\n\nNT16 -> 't37'\n\nNT26 -> 't14'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nWait, actually, I need to check all the rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\nNT10 -> t26\n\nNT26 -> t14\n\nNT6 -> t25\n\nNT15 -> t4\n\nNT26 is also defined as NT64 -> 't23'? Wait, no, looking through:\n\nThe grammar has:\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nNT26 -> 't14'\n\nSo, in the string, 't10' would correspond to NT10's production, which is 't26', so that's a bit confusing because t10 is in the string as a terminal, but perhaps it's a typo or maybe it's part of an NT that eventually leads to that terminal.\n\nWait no, the string is t10 t20 t36... etc. So each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, but some of these may correspond to NTs directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see:\n\nNT85 -> 't4'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT55 -> 't35'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nSo t4 can be from NT15 or NT4.\n\nSimilarly, NT25 -> 't25'\n\nNT80 -> 't26'\n\nSo t25 is from NT80.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for each 't' in the string and see if it's directly derived from a terminal.\n\nLet me go through the string step by step:\n\n1. t10: is this a terminal? In the grammar, I see NT10 -> 't26'. So t10 is an NT that produces 't26', not a terminal itself. So the string starts with T10, which is derived from 't26'? That doesn't make sense because the string starts with t10, which is a terminal, so NT10 must directly produce it, but according to the grammar, NT10 -> t26. So that would mean the string cannot start with t10 because it's supposed to come from NT10, which is itself t26.\n\nWait, no, that's confusing. If NT10 produces 't26', then any derivation through NT10 would result in t26 being added to the string. The string starts with t10, but in the grammar, t10 is not a terminal; it's an NT that only produces 't26'. So that means the string starting with t10 is invalid because in the grammar, t10 is not a terminal, but an NT producing t26. Therefore, the string cannot contain t10 as a terminal because it's never directly produced by a production rule as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me confirm the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar:\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nSo the non-terminal NT10 can produce the terminal 't26', not 't10'. Therefore, any occurrence of 't10' in the string is invalid because NT10 is not a terminal; it produces 't26'. So the initial t10 in the string is not possible because NT10 can only generate 't26'. So the string cannot contain 't10' as a terminal.\n\nBut that can't be right because in the string, 't10' is present. So this suggests that the string cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case because perhaps the production rules could derive 't10' through some longer path. For example, maybe NT10 could produce t26, which is t26, but what about 't10'? In the grammar, 't10' is produced by which NTT? Looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't10' as a terminal.

Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two on the right, or a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions seem to follow this structure except maybe the rules that produce terminals directly, like NT22 -> 't24' or NT2 -> 't6'. But I think since they're in CNF, those are allowed as single terminals are treated as NTs with epsilon productions, but the focus here is on applying the productions to derive the string.\n\nThe string to check is: `t40 t35 t22 t32 t26 t24 t2 t6 t12 t12 t22 t5 t40 t15 t23 t34 t40 t34 t37 t31 t6 t9 t23 t37 t10 t8 t36 t40 t9 t20 t12`.\n\nWait, but looking closer, the string has spaces\u2014probably separating the tokens. So I think each part like 't40' is a separate token.\n\nI think the approach is to start from the start symbol S and try to derive the string step by step, matching each token. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production should produce two symbols, so each step should handle two tokens at a time.\n\nLet me list the production rules that directly produce 't' tokens because the string has several of them. These are the terminal symbols, so they must be directly derived from some NT rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, here are some that produce 't':\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT22 -> 't24', 't15', 't9'\n- NT25 -> 't25' (Wait, no, that's a non-terminal production rule, not a terminal)\nWait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT22 -> 't24', 't15', 't9' So each production for NT22 results in one 't'.\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT51 -> 't20'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT86 -> 't34'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT28 -> 't10' (Wait, no: NT28 is a non-terminal, but in our string, we have 't10' as a token. Wait, looking at the string: the first few tokens are t40, t35, t22, etc., so 't10' must come from somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list of which NT rules produce each terminal. Let me go through the rules:\n\n- NT22 -> 't24', 't15', 't9' \nWait, no, that's a single production, not multiple. So NT22 can become 't24' OR 't15' OR 't9'. So for each NT22, it can produce any of those terminals.\n\nSimilarly:\n- NT70 -> 't78' (Wait no, wait looking at the rules, is there a NT70 that produces 't36'? Let me check. Oh, in the rules: NT70 -> 't72' and others?

No, wait, NT25 -> 't25' must be a mistake; no, probably it's a terminal. Wait no, looking again, the rules for NT25: Oh, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. NT25 has a production that includes a terminal. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking back, the rules include NT25 -> 't25'?

So perhaps that's a mistake. Wait, actually, looking again, after NT25, the rules are:\n\nNT25 -> 't25' and NT49 -> 't8', NT55 -> 't20', etc. So maybe I need to check each rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a list:\n\nProduction rules that produce terminals:\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT22 -> 't24', 't15', 't9'\n- NT25: let me see if NT25 has any terminal.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, which simplifies some aspects of parsing.\n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes it easier to analyze the possible derivations because the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t31 t10 t2 t35 t10 t22 t35 t10 t41 t40 t2 t36 t26 t4 t35 t22 t9 t36 t15 t24 t37 t14 t15 t40 t25 t5 t5 t10 t2 t14 t22 t24`. \n\nI'll start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The initial string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a way that S can derive this sequence through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S is only present in the production S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step would be S \u2192 NT9 NT5. The string starts with 't31', but that's not a non-terminal. So both NT9 and NT5 must derive strings, possibly by themselves.\n\nNow, I'll look at what NT9 and NT5 can derive from the grammar:\n\n- NT9 can produce 't35' or other non-terminals. Looking at the productions for NT9:\n  - NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n  - NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 (Wait, no, NT9 is higher up. Let me check the grammar again. Oh, the grammar provided includes various NT9 productions.)\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, let me locate NT9's productions. In the grammar, NT9 appears in two productions:\n1. NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n2. NT93 -> NT16 NT5 (but this is NT93, not NT9)\n\nWait, maybe I need to list all possible productions for each non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by building a tree or seeing if each token in the string can be the result of a production.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string top-down using the grammar. However, the string is quite long, and the grammar is extensive, so it's going to be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string corresponds to a terminal that can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nFirst, list each token in the string and see if they correspond to any terminals in the grammar:\n\nThe string tokens are: t31, t10, t2, t35, t10, t22, t35, t10, t41, t40, t2, t36, t26, t4, t35, t22, t9, t36, t15, t24, t37, t14, t15, t40, t25, t5, t5, t10, t2, t14, t22, t24.\n\nI notice that some of these terminals might not be available in the grammar. For example, t41, t37, t9, t14, etc., are in the string, but let's check if these terminals are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that many non-terminals expand into terminals ending with t2, t35, etc. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26', 't80'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT12 \u2192 't10'\n- NT14 \u2192 't8', 't23'\n- NT24 \u2192 't34', 't35'\n- NT28 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't40', 't88', 't13'\n- NT36 \u2192 't41', 't63', etc.\n- NT40 \u2192 't34', 't36', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24', etc.\n- NT63 \u2192 't32' (ends with 't32')\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I spot a few terminals as the result of NT productions. For example, NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4, and another production NT85 \u2192 NT79 NT89, but I don't see any terminal 't37' mentioned.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all terminals introduced in the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, each time a non-terminal is followed by a 't' and a number, it's a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26', 't80'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT12 \u2192 't10'\n- NT14 \u2192 't8', 't23'\n- NT24 \u2192 't34', 't35'\n- NT28 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't40', 't88', 't13'\n- NT36 \u2192 't41', etc.\n- NT40 \u2192 ... etc.\n- NT10 appears as a terminal? Wait, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT10 include 't26' and 't80'. So NT10 is a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal that expands into terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, a production is like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT5, so NT52 is a non-terminal. The productions where a non-terminal is followed by 't' and a number are terminal productions. So for example, when a non-terminal is followed by 't' and a number, that production is terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, here are the terminal productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26', 't80'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT12 \u2192 't10'\n- NT14 \u2192 't8', 't23'\n- NT24 \u2192 't34', 't35'\n- NT28 \u2192 't15'\n- NT35 \u2192 't40', 't88', 't13'\n- NT36 \u2192 't41', 't63', etc.\n- NT40 \u2192 't34', 't36', etc.\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24', 't35'\n- NT63 \u2192 't32'\n- NT10 appears in the non-terminals, so NT10 is a non-terminal, but when it's followed by a 't', it's a terminal.

The grammar is quite extensive, and the string is quite long, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the grammar structure. It looks like each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except when the right-hand side (RHS) has a terminal. Wait, actually, some rules have 't' as a terminal, so not all are just two non-terminals. Oh, right, in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So some of these rules are actually single-terminals, which will correspond to terminals in the string.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is: `t10 t3 t35 t32 t34 t31 t4 t31 t32 t32 t37 t20 t20 t26 t24 t40 t23 t10 t34 t36 t37 t26 t34 t15 t32 t20 t34 t9 t15 t2 t35 t22`.\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminals, each followed by a space. So the challenge is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I should look for a path through the grammar where each non-terminal can be expanded step by step, eventually leading to all terminals in the string.\n\nLet's start by looking for the beginning of the string. It starts with `t10`. So I need to find a production rule that directly produces `t10`. Scanning through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't10' as a production. Wait, here:\n\n- NT10 -> NT84 NT25\n- NT11 -> NT55 NT0\n- NT10 appears as NT84 -> NT28 NT8 and NT25 -> 't25'. Also, in another rule: NT10 -> NT26 NT16. Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me check for any non-terminal that directly produces t10. Scanning all the rules, I don't see any direct t10 as a production, but in the given grammar, I do see:\n\n- NT20 -> 't20'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT84 -> 't5' from earlier? Wait, the string starts with t10, so I need a rule that can produce t10. Looking again.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT28 -> 't10' (from NT28 -> 't10')\nWait, no. Let's check the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\nYes, NT28 -> t10. So 't10' is directly produced by NT28.\n\nSo, the first part of the string `t10` must come from NT28.\n\nNow, how does NT28 get derived? Looking at the grammar, we have:\n\nLooking through the left-hand sides (LHS) of the rules, I need to find which non-terminal expands to NT28.\n\nLooking at the grammar, one of the rules is NT82 -> NT49 NT9. Wait, no, that's NT82. Not NT28.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for NT28. Hmm, NT82 is NT82 -> NT49 NT9.\n\nWait, there's a rule: NT28 -> 't10' (I think I miswrote earlier, but in the given grammar, looking for NT28, I don't see it. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT36, we have NT36 -> NT35 NT56, etc. Let me look for NT28.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT28: it's not directly present, but checking each non-terminal:\n\nNT82 -> NT49 NT9. Hmm, but that's the expansion. So maybe NT28 is derived from another rule.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for how NT28 is expanded:\n\nWait, no. Let me try to see which non-terminal expands into NT28.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT82: NT82 -> NT49 NT9.\n\nBut I'm trying to derive 't10', which is NT28. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the initial token is 't10', which is generated by NT28, right? So that would mean that NT28 must be a non-terminal that is expanded from the start symbol S. So S must eventually derive NT28, which then produces 't10'.\n\nSo, to get 't10', S has to reach NT28.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S -> NT9 NT5. So S expands to NT9 and NT5. So either NT9 or NT5 is part of this derivation.\n\nSo, let's see if either NT9 or NT5 can be expanded to NT28.\n\nLooking at NT9: The rules list shows NT93, NT95, etc., but wait, there's a rule NT9 -> NT72 NT23.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT93 -> NT16 NT5, NT95 -> NT10 NT11, etc.\n\nWait, no, let's look for production rules of NT9. From the list:\n\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23. So NT9 expands to NT72 and NT23.\n\nThen, to get NT28, I need to see if either of these can produce NT28.\n\nLooking at NT72:\n\nNT72 appears in the rules as several, including NT72 -> NT87 NT36, and also NT15 -> NT27 NT60 isn't relevant. Wait, looking for NT72 to expand to NT28.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. For example:\n\nLooking for NT72: I don't see a rule that directly produces NT72. Wait, no, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should use a top-down parsing approach, trying to find a way down from S that matches the string.\n\nThe string starts with t10, so S must go through NT28.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT28 something. But S is NT9 and NT5, so possibly S \u2192 NT9 \u2192 something that includes NT28, or S \u2192 NT5 \u2192 something that includes NT28.\n\nFrom the rules, S is NT9 and NT5. So let's see:\n\n- S -> NT9 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9: it's replaced as NT72 NT23. So S \u2192 NT72 NT23 NT5.\n\nHmm, but now I have two non-terminals: NT72 and NT23. Wait, but the string continues to more t's, so perhaps the NT23 may also expand.\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Maybe I should build a parse tree from the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be rewritten using the grammar steps.\n\nAnother approach is to reverse the process: starting from the string, break it down into components and see if each part can be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps focusing on the first few tokens and seeing if they can be produced by any chain of rules.\n\nSo, the first token is 't10', generated by NT28. So the expansion must include NT28.\n\nLooking at how NT28 is produced. From the grammar, is there a production rule that includes NT28?\n\nLooking through the LHS of all rules, I notice:\n\n- NT82 appears in the rule NT82 -> NT49 NT9.\n\nSo, to produce 't10' as the first token, the derivation path is S \u2192 NT28 something.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, S is NT9 and NT5:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5.\n\nSo to get NT28, we need to see if either NT9 or NT5 can produce a chain that includes NT28.\n\nFrom NT9's rules, NT9 -> NT72 NT23. So NT9 expands to NT72 and NT23.\n\nNow, if we have NT72, which perhaps can expand to NT28. But looking at the rules, I don't see NT72 being a source for NT28.\n\nLooking further, perhaps NT72 can expand through multiple steps.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace a possible expansion.\n\nLooking for a path where starting from S, we can derive a series of non-terminals that lead to the tokens in the string.\n\nLet me attempt to build the expansion step by step.\n\n1.

{"custom_id":"request-613","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with the task of determining whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. The rules are all of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols. The start symbol is S, so we need to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals until we get a string consisting of terminals, which in this case are all the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string we need to evaluate is:\n`t22 t14 t25 t22 t6 t20 t37 t31 t35 t12 t25 t4 t10 t31 t41 t32 t36 t40 t36 t40 t36 t22 t6 t34 t25 t10 t26 t2 t8 t2 t24 t8 t31`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of 29 tokens (since there are 28 spaces). Each token is a 't' followed by a number. So, no letters except 't', which is consistent with the grammar because all the terminals are of the form 'tX'.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar rules, all the non-terminals are on the left side, and they each replace into two non-terminals. The end of the string shows that some non-terminals like NT22, NT64, NT42, etc., directly expand into 't' terms. For example:\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT66 \u2192 't6'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n- And so on.\n\nThis tells me that some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. So, the first step is to see if the entire string can be broken down into these terminal expansions following the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to reverse-engineer the string. Each terminal in the string is part of the production of a specific non-terminal. For instance, 't22' comes from certain NT22 rules. If I can chain these non-terminals back to S, I can confirm if the string is generated.\n\nBut working this out manually might be complex. Alternatively, I can check if the string fits the patterns defined by the grammar by looking for the right terminals in order.\n\nThe grammar's rules are recursive, so the string must be built step by step according to the productions. However, manually expanding each step would be time-consuming, especially given the length of the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the structure that the grammar produces. The start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the first production from S is two parts: NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the first token is 't22', which likely comes from NT22. But to see how NT22 is generated, we'd look for the production rules for NT22.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. So, NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. The first token is 't22', but in the provided grammar, there's no direct production for NT22 \u2192 't22'. Instead, NT22 directly expands into 't15' or 't9'. Therefore, the first token 't22' might not be part of the language generated by this grammar because there's no rule that allows NT22 to produce 't22'.\n\nWait a minute, in the grammar, the rules for NT22 are:\nNT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't9'.\n\nSo, 't22' is not directly a terminal of any non-terminal in the grammar. Looking through all the rules, there are other non-terminals that expand into 't22' indirectly? For example, is there any NT that expands into 't22' or another non-terminal that can produce 't22'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly or indirectly (through multiple steps) produce 't22'. For instance, NT14 seems to expand into 't23', NT26 into 't14', etc. I don't see a path that would produce 't22' anywhere.\n\nTherefore, the first token in the string is 't22', which is not a terminal that any non-terminal in the grammar can produce directly or indirectly. This suggests that the string is not part of the language generated by this grammar.\n\nMoreover, even if I had to consider that perhaps 't22' is produced by some longer chain, given that NT22 doesn't produce 't22', it seems impossible unless there's an error in the rules, but according to the given grammar, there's no rule where NT22 \u2192 't22'.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the string contains a terminal 't22' that isn't allowed by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-618","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' followed by numbers, like `t9 t10 t26 ...` and so on.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have specific rules: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. Also, the start symbol is only on the left side of the productions.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, and the productions all seem to follow the CNF structure. Each production is two non-terminals on the left, and on the right, they produce either non-terminals or terminals (some look like 'tN', where N is a number). Wait, actually, the productions are a mix because some of the right-hand sides are 't' followed by a number, which are terminals.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminal symbols separated by spaces. Each 't9', 't10', etc., should correspond to some production in the grammar.\n\nMy approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each node has exactly two children, and the entire tree starts with S. So the length of the string should be 2^n for some n, because each step doubles the number of symbols (except for the leaves, which are terminals). Let's check the string length.\n\nThe string is: `t9 t10 t26 t8 t35 t8 t37 t25 t25 t31 t40 t9 t40 t3 t20 t14 t5 t20 t6 t35 t4 t41 t36 t23 t2 t37 t23 t2 t35 t25 t5 t26 t10`.\n\nCounting the number of tokens (excluding the spaces): Let's see, the string in the question is written with each token separated by a space, so each space indicates a split. Let's count them:\n\n1. t9\n2. t10\n3. t26\n4. t8\n5. t35\n6. t8\n7. t37\n8. t25\n9. t25\n10. t31\n11. t40\n12. t9\n13. t40\n14. t3\n15. t20\n16. t14\n17. t5\n18. t20\n19. t6\n20. t35\n21. t4\n22. t41\n23. t36\n24. t23\n25. t2\n26. t37\n27. t23\n28. t2\n29. t35\n30. t25\n31. t5\n32. t26\n33. t10\n\nSo that's 33 tokens. Hmm, 33 is not a power of 2, which makes me think that either the string is wrong, or perhaps it's a mistake because CNF parses should have a number of symbols equal to 2^n. Let me check again: 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 33 is in between, which is not a power of two. Wait, 33 is 2^5 + 1. That's a problem because the parse tree would require the leaves to be 2^n. So perhaps the string isn't valid from the start.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\n1. t9\n2. t10\n3. t26\n4. t8\n5. t35\n6. t8\n7. t37\n8. t25\n9. t25\n10. t31\n11. t40\n12. t9\n13. t40\n14. t3\n15. t20\n16. t14\n17. t5\n18. t20\n19. t6\n20. t35\n21. t4\n22. t41\n23. t36\n24. t23\n25. t2\n26. t37\n27. t23\n28. t2\n29. t35\n30. t25\n31. t5\n32. t26\n33. t10\n\nNo, that's still 33 tokens. So 33 is not a power of two. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the string can't be generated by this grammar because the number of symbols isn't a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm counting the number of 't' symbols correctly, but it's possible that the length could vary if the grammar allows some productions that produce a single symbol at certain branchings. Wait, no, in CNF, each production splits into exactly two parts. So the number of symbols in the parse must be 2^n. However, the string has 33 symbols, which isn't a power of two. Therefore, it must be invalid.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe the start symbol wasn't correctly applied. But in the initial parse, the start symbol S would produce NT9 NT5. Each of those NTs would themselves split, so perhaps the sequence length could vary? No, in a full parse tree, each production contributes a split, so the number of symbols should always be a power of two. For example, S \u2192 A B (2), each A and B can split into two more (4), etc. So 2^n.\n\nSince 33 isn't a power of two, it's impossible for the string to be generated by a proper CNF grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check.\n\nThe string is: t9, t10, t26, t8, t35, t8, t37, t25, t25, t31, t40, t9, t40, t3, t20, t14, t5, t20, t6, t35, t4, t41, t36, t23, t2, t37, t23, t2, t35, t25, t5, t26, t10. That's 33 symbols, yes.\n\nSo, the number of production steps is such that the number of terminals is 33, which is not a power of two. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to generate this string. So the answer should be No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is incorrect, but given the structure, I think the count is the key here.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's start by understanding the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol. The start symbol is S, and the rules seem to expand each non-terminal into pairs of other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to check is: `t34 t12 t10 t41 t35 t37 t40 t25 t20 t3 t5 t24 t22 t3 t35 t26 t23 t15 t36 t20 t14 t20 t40 t4 t4 t34 t9 t20 t3 t12 t24 t36 t3 t40`.\n\nI notice that most of these are 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminal symbols. The non-terminals are everything else, like S, NT5, NT6, etc.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. But wait, looking closer, some rules have three non-terminals. For example, NT22 -> 't15' is a direct terminal, which is allowed because in CNF, productions can have either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each rule either expands to two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in standard CNF, the productions are A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. But there's an exception where a production can have a single terminal symbol as well, making it a \"simplification\" of the CNF. So in our case, the grammar allows for some productions to directly produce terminals, which means during parsing, we can have steps where a non-terminal directly becomes a terminal.\n\nNow, to parse the string, I need to work backwards from the start symbol S, expanding it until I match the entire string.

{"custom_id":"request-637","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because it simplifies some parse tasks. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the structure of the grammar and see what the start symbol is. The start symbol seems to be S, as it's the top-level rule. The string I need to evaluate starts with t36 t35 t12... and goes on from there. Since the grammar is in CNF, all production rules produce two non-terminals, except for the terminals. That means each production step reduces the number of symbols by one until we reach the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of t followed by numbers. These are likely the terminal symbols, so I need to trace back how they could have been derived from S.\n\nI'll start by listing some of the production rules that directly produce terminals. For example, NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9'. Another is NT2 -> 't6'. So, each of these rules allows NT22 to produce 't15' or 't9', and NT2 produces 't6'.\n\nLooking at the string, I see several 't's and numbers. Let me try to parse from the end towards the beginning, using the rightmost derivation method. Sometimes this approach works because it simplifies things.\n\nLet's take the last few tokens: 't32'. I need to find a production rule that leads to this. Looking through the grammar, I see NT63 -> 't32' and NT64 -> 't23', but wait, 't32' is directly derived from NT63 or others. Let me check if NT63 is present anywhere. In the grammar, NT63 is mentioned as NT63 -> 't32'. So, 't32' comes from NT63.\n\nMoving to the previous token, 't24'. Looking for a production that leads to 't24'. The rules include NT24 -> 't24' perhaps? Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see a rule for NT24 directly. Let's see: looking through the rules, NT64 -> 't23' and NT63 -> 't32', NT52 -> 't24' because NT52 -> NT60 NT81 and so on, but maybe there's a rule that directly produces 't24'. Alternatively, looking at NT42, I don't see it directly, but let's check the rules. Wait, there's NT24 -> 't24' perhaps? Wait, no, in the list, I see NT22 -> 't15' and 't9', NT2 -> 't6', NT4 -> 't34', etc. Hmm. Wait, let me check the provided grammar again.\n\nWait, in the list, there's a rule: NT64 -> 't23'. So, perhaps the production after NT63 is 't32', and before that might be an NT rule. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for a parse tree. Let's try to see what the string could represent. The string is: t36 t35 t12 t22 t32 t9 t31 t41 t8 t32 t5 t32 t22 t14 t35 t24 t2 t8 t34 t35 t6 t5 t31 t26 t8 t22 t23 t3 t34 t14 t26 t20 t12 t41.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. I'll try to find a way to parse this step by step. Starting from S, which is NT52 -> NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, S is NT52, which is NT69 and NT52? Wait, looking back, the start symbol is S, which is defined as NT52 -> NT9 NT5. Wait, no, the production for S is S->NT9 NT5 NT5. Wait, let me check: the first rule is S -> NT9 NT5 NT5? Wait, no, the first line is 'S -> NT9 NT5'. Wait, no, the first production is S -> NT9 NT5. Wait, looking back: the first line is S -> NT9NT5. Then NT52->... etc. Wait, maybe the way the rules are written has a space, so perhaps it's S -> NT9 NT5? Which means NT9 followed by NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial S production is S -> NT9 NT5, which would make parsing more challenging because we have to derive two symbols. But no, actually, wait, wait: in context-free grammars, each production is a single symbol expanding into two symbols. So S -> NT9 NT5 means S expands to NT9 and NT5 as the two symbols. So to generate a string starting with NT9 then NT5, but our string starts with t36, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t36. So I'm getting confused because S is a non-terminal symbol. The process is to derive S into a sequence of non-terminals, and then those non-terminals into terminals. So maybe I need to see if the sequence of t's can be derived from S.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to see if each 't' corresponds to a rule. So, for example, if the first 't36' is derived from NT63, and then that NT63 must have been derived from a higher-level NT. Similarly, 't35' could be derived from NT65 or similar. Let's try to reconstruct the parse.\n\nLet me try to work backwards. The string ends with 't41'. Let's see where 't41' comes from. Looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production for 't41'. So perhaps 't41' is derived from a combo that eventually leads back to the start symbol.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps look for rules that directly produce single terminals. For example, NT22 -> 't15' and 't9'. So, in the string, there's t15. Looking at the string: I see 't14', which I don't immediately recognize. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can match the string step by step. Let's try to see the pattern.\n\nStarting from the beginning: t36 t35 t12 t22 t32 t9 t31 t41 t8 t32 t5 t32 t22 t14 t35 t24 t2 t8 t34 t35 t6 t5 t31 t26 t8 t22 t23 t3 t34 t14 t26 t20 t12 t41.\n\nThat's 39 tokens. That's a lot, but let's see.\n\n- The first token is t36. Looking for a rule that produces 't36'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT63 -> 't32' and others, but nothing directly for t36. Wait, maybe NT63 is involved. Wait, another rule is NT63 -> 't32'. So 't36' must come from NT63 (since NT63 is 't32' but maybe another rule leads to 't36').\n\nWait, in the rules, I don't see 't36' as a terminal; instead, NT63 is defined as 't32', so that's confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT63 -> 't32'\n\nSo 't32' comes from NT63.\n\nThen, before 't32', we have 't24'.\n\nSo, does 't24' come from some NT rule? Looking through the rules, I see NT42 -> 't24' perhaps? Wait, let me see. Wait, in the provided grammar, there's a rule for NT42 -> 't24'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- There's NT42 -> 't24' I think. Wait, no, looking closely:\n\nLooking for 't24', I don't see any rule; wait, maybe it's derived from an NT.\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I don't immediately see any NT that directly produces 't24', but perhaps it's part of a chain. Alternatively, looking for a rule that produces 't8' and then 't35' etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Maybe I should consider that each terminal is generated directly by an NT. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, so each t followed by a number is a terminal. Now, each 't' is part of a production rule.\n\nWait, let's think of 't36' as the terminal from NT63. So, maybe the sequence starts with NT63 -> 't36'.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT63 is a non"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t26 t40 t37 t36 t40 t2 t35 t36 t15 t2 t6 t10 t24 t23 t8 t37 t8 t10 t15 t37 t3 t35 t34 t22 t37 t23 t26 t35 t9 t23 t41 t24 t6 t5 t36`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means it's structured as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left. The given grammar seems to have a mix of both, but I need to check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most rules have two non-terminals, like S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Some non-terminals are connected to terminals, such as NT22 \u2192 't15'. These are the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers. Each 't' is likely a terminal symbol, and the numbers are part of the non-terminals. The task is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar, meaning that the non-terminals can be expanded into the terminals and numbers in the string.\n\nI'll start by thinking about the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree. Each node is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. \n\nLet's think about the initial symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the root of the parse tree would be S, and it has two children: NT9 and NT5. Each of these NT symbols needs to expand into a sequence of terminals or smaller non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t26, which I think corresponds to NT26 \u2192 t26. So, in the parse tree, the leftmost NT26 would produce t26.\n\nThe string is quite long, so I need to parse through it step by step. Let's consider the string chunks.\n\nThe string is: t26 t40 t37 t36 t40 t2 t35 t36 t15 t2 t6 t10 t24 t23 t8 t37 t8 t10 t15 t37 t3 t35 t34 t22 t37 t23 t26 t35 t9 t23 t41 t24 t6 t5 t36.\n\nLet's group some parts:\n\n- Starts with t26, so S's leftmost NT26 must expand into t26 followed by its right NT.\n\nNT26 has a production: looking through the rules, I see NT26 \u2192 t25. Wait, but in the rules, I see NT25 is a production? Wait no, looking again, I think I'm getting mixed up.\n\nWait, let me check the rules for NT26. Oh, in the rules, NT26 is 't25'? Or is that another way? Looking back, I see:\n\nNT26: 't25'? No, wait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT25: NT42 \u2192 't25'?\n\nWait, let me look at the rules provided:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSimilarly, for NT26: NT26 \u2192 't22' ?\n\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT22 has several productions, but none for NT22 \u2192 't15', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong.\n\nWait, no, the rules provided are all the NT's and their productions. So, I need to scan each rule to see which NT symbols lead to terminals.\n\nWait, in the given rules, for example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' etc. I see NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nLine 17: NT22 \u2192 't15'\nLine 19: NT22 \u2192 't9'\nLine 21: NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, in the provided rules, I see that line 17 is NT22 \u2192 't15', line 19 is NT22 \u2192 't9', line 21 is NT22 \u2192 't34'.\n\nSo, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34' directly. Similarly, other NTs have terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, the first t26 must come from NT26.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because that structure is easier to analyze. The string provided is quite long, so I'll need to methodically check each part.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is: \n\nt6 t8 t24 t2 t5 t32 t4 t12 t26 t12 t2 t12 t2 t34 t37 t26 t9 t32 t8 t14 t3 t2 t35 t35 t2 t23 t37 t10 t23 t34 t37 t26 t9 t14 t2.\n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of t-something, which I assume are terminals. The grammar replaces non-terminals with sequences of other non-terminals or terminals. So I'll need to see if each of these t tokens can be derived from the respective non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal on the right side becomes a specific pair of terminals or a combination. For example, the first production is S -> NT9 NT5. So S must start with NT9 and NT5. Let me see:\n\nThe string starts with t6, which I think comes from NT2, as there's a production NT2 -> 't6'. But wait, let me check. Wait, the grammar's rules include NT22 -> 't34', and NT22 has another rule: NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9'. Also, NT22 -> 't34'. Hmm, so maybe NT22 can derive 't24'? Wait, looking at the rules, NT22 is in some production like NT22 -> 't15' and 't9', and another rule 't34'. So perhaps there's a rule somewhere that allows NT22 to be 't24'. Let me check:\n\nAh, I see NT66 -> 't3' which isn't relevant. Wait, the production NT4 -> 't35' and others. I need to see how each part of the string maps.\n\nWait, the first part is t6. Looking at the grammar, NT22 -> 't15', 't9', and 't34'. Wait, but wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'. So that's three options. So if the first part is t6, where does that come from? Looking through the rules, let's see:\n\nLooking for NT6 -> 't25' and other rules. Let me see the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the non-terminals, I see NT6 -> 't25', NT12 -> 't10', NT4 -> 't34', etc. Hmm, I'm looking for t6, which is part of the string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t6, then t8, t24, t2, t5, etc. Wait, maybe I should look for the derivation steps.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. So the first part should be derived from NT9, which then produces something that starts the string.\n\nLooking at the NT9 productions: I don't see any directly listed for NT9 except in some rules. Wait, let me check if any non-terminals produce t6, t8, t24, etc.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT9 directly producing t6. So perhaps that's a problem. Wait, let me check:\n\nThe first production is S -> NT9 NT52. So the first step is NT9 and NT52.\n\nNow, NT9 has production rules. Let me check: Oh, I see NT93 -> NT16 NT5, but no rule for NT9 itself. Wait, I'm looking for all the rules under NT9. Maybe it's not directly listed. Maybe I need to see if it's on the right side of a production. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the grammar is given as:\n\nS -> NT9 NT5\n\nNT52 -> NT89 NT35\n\nNT84 -> NT28 NT8\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\n\nWait, that's a lot of rules. I think some of these rules may lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work backwards from the given string and see if each token matches any non-terminal and then backtrack.\n\nSo, let's take the entire string and try to match it from the end using the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t6 t8 t24 t2 t5 t32 t4 t12 t26 t12 t2 t12 t2 t34 t37 t26 t9 t32 t8 t14 t3 t2 t35 t35 t2 t23 t37 t10 t23 t34 t37 t26 t9 t14 t2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can parse the string as a sequence of non-terminals and see if each can be expanded into the token.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct the parse tree. Since the string starts with t6, which is a terminal. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t6.\n\nLooking through the grammar's right-hand sides, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't34', but wait, that's not t6. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, I have:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nNT12 -> 't10'\n\nNT96 -> 't22'\n\nNT66 -> 't3'\n\nNT85 -> 't4'\n\nNT89 -> 't72' maybe? Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking for t6. Let me check all rules where a non-terminal produces a terminal:\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\n- NT22 is part of several productions, like NT22 -> 't15', etc.\n\nWait, but there's no non-terminal that directly produces t6 in the rules I listed. Did I miss one? Or wait, maybe I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me check again.\n\nAh, here's a line: NT4 -> 't34', but that's not t6. Wait, looking further:\n\nLooking for a non-terminal that can produce t6. Perhaps I missed one. Wait, in the list, I have NT22 producing t34, but not t6. So perhaps the first term t6 isn't derivable from any non-terminal, which would mean the entire string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but the first production is S -> NT9 NT5, so the first symbol must come from NT9. Which, looking through the rules, I don't see a production for NT9 that starts with t6. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a production for NT9. Let me check:\n\nThe provided grammar includes:\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\n\nNT89 -> NT72 NT83\n\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23\n\nWait, these don't start with t6. So unless there's a production for NT9 that produces t6, the string starts with t6, which should come from NT9 or a production that starts with NT9 producing a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me check each non-terminal's possible productions to see if any produce t6.\n\nNT22: yes, NT22 can produce t34, but that's not helpful.\n\nLooking for a non-terminal NTxxx that on production produces t6. I don't see any such rules in the provided grammar. So perhaps the string starts with a terminal that isn't allowed, meaning the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a production. Scanning the entire grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal on the left equals a terminal on the right, with any other symbols.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example, NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'. Wait, 't...' are terminals. So, the non-terminals on the left side are NT22. So NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34', but none produce 't6'. Therefore, the string starts with 't6', which cannot be derived from any non-terminal, meaning the string is invalid.\n\nBut wait, perhaps it can be derived through a chain of productions elsewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken. Let me look for a non-terminal that can derive 't6'. Suppose there's a non-terminal NT6 that produces 't25', which is another terminal. But again, I don't see any production that can lead to 't6' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the productions. Each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t37 t9 t10 t32 t20 t41 t14 t22 t31 t12 t10 t20 t4 t23 t15 t9 t15 t34 t34 t41 t41 t23 t34 t22 t34 t3 t25 t40 t26 t9 t10 t15 t10 t31 t3 t41`.\n\nFirst, I'll process the grammar rules to map non-terminals to terminals. This is essential because I can then check if the string can be derived from S by replacing non-terminals with their terminal expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice several rules that directly map non-terminals to specific terminals or strings. For example:\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT52\n- NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n- NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT95, etc.\n\nBut I also see rules where non-terminals expand into strings of terminals. For instance, some rules end with 'tX' where X is a number. These are leaf nodes in the parse tree, so they correspond to actual terminals in the generated string.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I'll attempt to reconstruct the parse tree by breaking down the string from the bottom up, using the grammar rules to match the terminal strings.\n\nStarting with the entire string and trying to split it into chunks that match the right-hand sides of the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step expands a single non-terminal into two others or terminals. But wait, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So each production has either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Therefore, in parsing, each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two non-terminals, or with a terminal (leaving it as a leaf).\n\nBut since the string is given as a sequence of terminals, the parse tree will consist of a series of non-terminals splitting into terminals. Each internal node in the parse tree corresponds to a non-terminal production, which can either split into two non-terminals or be a terminal.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. Perhaps I should try to see if each part of the string can be matched by the grammar rules, starting from the initial symbol S.\n\nLet me start by considering the entire string and see if it can be matched by S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo, if S expands into NT9 and NT52, then the string should start with NT9 NT52. Let me look at the string:\n\nThe first token is 't37', which seems to be NT9. Let me check what NT9's production is.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT10 NT15 (among others), but also looking for NT9 \u2192 something that results in 't37'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, many rules have the non-terminals ending with tX, like NT22 \u2192 't15', etc. So maybe NT9 has a rule that ends with t37.\n\nLooking at the rules, I find that NT37 is defined as NT10 \u2192 't26', but that's under NT26's production.\n\nWait, actually, I'm looking for a rule where NT9 \u2192 't37', but I don't see that directly. Alternatively, perhaps through a series of productions.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's see which non-terminals produce a terminal string starting with 't37'.\n\nIn the grammar, I find that NT26 \u2192 't14' and NT26 \u2192 't23', etc. Also, NT73 \u2192 't34', etc. Hmm. But I'm trying to find a non-terminal that when expanded gives 't37'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 NT83 NT56 \u2192 NT56 \u2192 NT15 \u2192 NT6 \u2192 ... No, perhaps another way.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\nLooking for 't37' as a terminal: From the rules, I find NT86 \u2192 't34', NT34 \u2192 't22', etc. Wait, perhaps NT86 is part of a bigger structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 produces a string that can start with 't37' when expanded. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, does NT9 have a production ending with 't37'? I don't see anything directly, but maybe through substitution.\n\nWait, let's look for NT9's productions. The rules for NT9 are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT95\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT95 NT42\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT82 NT9\n\nHmm, these don't directly produce terminals. So perhaps NT9 is a non-terminal that will eventually expand into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider the Reverse Direction: start from the string and try to see if it can be reduced to S using the grammar rules in reverse.\n\nEach production A \u2192 BC can be reversed as BC \u2192 A, so during reduction, we look for pairs of consecutive symbols that match the body of a production.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, which includes both A \u2192 BC and A \u2192 a. So during reduction, each step reduces a non-terminal A into two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nBut if I'm trying to reduce the string, I need to work from the end, so perhaps I should look for the rightmost symbols that can form a production.\n\nWait, let's see: The last symbol in the string is 't41', which is in the grammar under NT41.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT40 \u2192 NT64 NT16\n\nNT41 \u2192 NT23 NT25 (Wait, no, I see NT15 \u2192 t4, NT22 \u2192 t34 etc., but let me check NT30: NT30 \u2192 NT55 NT0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, I should look for a production A \u2192 a where a is the last symbol. Let's see if the last symbol is 't41', which comes from NT41.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, do any non-terminals directly produce 't41'? Let me search:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule like NT41 \u2192 't41'. Perhaps it's produced through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last part of the string can be matched by a non-terminal that eventually leads back to S.\n\nThis approach might take a while, but I'll try to proceed step by step.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and see which ones can produce each of the terminals in the string.\n\nFor example, let's take the first token 't37'. Does any non-terminal have a production ending with 't37'?\n\nLooking at the rules: I see NT26 \u2192 't14' and others, but nothing ends with t37. Wait, let me check NT86: NT86 \u2192 't34', and from there, NT34 \u2192 't22'. But let's see:\n\nAnother way: Let's use the rules to map each non-terminal to the strings they produce directly.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9' or 't34'\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT10 NT15 \u2192 which would then expand into t26 and t4 \u2192 not t37.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to build a parse tree from the bottom up.\n\nStarting with the string, let's look for tokens that can be produced directly (i.e., A \u2192 a). For example, 't37' must come from a non-terminal NT37, which doesn't seem to exist in the grammar, but maybe via a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

{"custom_id":"request-672","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem. \n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, most of the productions seem to fit this: for example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5 is of the form A \u2192 BC, and many other productions are similar. However, some like NT22 \u2192 't15' are terminals, which is allowed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t2 t26 t14 t25 t34 t35 t10 t22 t23 t4 t15 t10 t23 t5 t40 t8 t12 t10 t10 t6 t9 t25 t32 t32 t35 t41 t34 t15 t41 t25 t25 t41 t8 t14 t3 t32.\n\nI notice that most of the symbols look like terminals (they end with 't' or are single letters like '32'). The string is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions.\n\nMy approach will be to build the parse tree from the string by trying to match production rules. Since the string is quite long, I'll need to do this step by step.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT9 and NT5. Looking at the first few symbols: t2, t26, t14, t25... Let me check which NT9 and NT5 produce these.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- NT9 does not appear in the productions, so maybe it's derived from another non-terminal. Wait, looking deeper, NT93 is a production, and so are NT79 and others. But NT9 itself? I don't see a production for NT9. Let me check all NT9* productions. It seems NT93, NT95, etc., are present but not NT9. So maybe NT9 is a terminal, but looking at the string, the initial symbols don't start with 't9'. Wait, the first symbol is t2, so maybe NT9 produces t9 or something else. Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT36 \u2192 t4, NT66 \u2192 t3, etc. Wait, but for NT9*, do any productions end with 't9'? Let me look:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 t4, not relevant.\n- NT78 \u2192 t40, etc.\nWait, looking for NT9* \u2192 tsomething. Hmm. I don't see any NT9* \u2192 t9. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me check all NT9*:\n\nLooking at the NT9* productions:\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, etc. Not 't9' directly. Hmm. Maybe NT9 is a non-terminal and produces other things. But perhaps the string starts with t2, which might be part of a different non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider NT2's productions. Let me see the NT2 production: NT26 \u2192 t14, etc. But no, NT2 is a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t2 comes from NT2, which is a terminal. But looking at the string, does t2 appear anywhere else?\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I should build the parse tree by matching the earliest productions.\n\nStart with the entire string and recursively split it into left and right parts based on the rules.\n\nThe string is: t2 t26 t14 t25 t34 t35 t10 t22 t23 t4 t15 t10 t23 t5 t40 t8 t12 t10 t10 t6 t9 t25 t32 t32 t35 t41 t34 t15 t41 t25 t25 t41 t8 t14 t3 t32.\n\nThis is 37 symbols long. Let's see if S can produce two parts that match these symbols.\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string must be divided into two parts: the first part is generated by NT9 and the second by NT5.\n\nLet me see what NT5 can generate. Looking at the productions for NT5: I don't see any direct production for NT5, but looking deeper, maybe NT5 is produced by another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all possible NTx:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT53, which isn't in the list. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list all non-terminals.\n\nWait, from the productions, the non-terminals are:\n\nS, NT9, NT52, NT84, NT93, NT69, NT95, NT0, NT93 again (multiple entries), NT52 with several productions, NT52 \u2192 several, etc. It's a bit messy.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to build a recursive descent parser, but that might take time. Alternatively, since it's a small string, I can try to see if it can be formed using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for possible splits.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Another approach is to note that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which implies specific structure, but perhaps the easier way is to consider that each production is two symbols, except for terminals. So for the purpose of this, the number of symbols in the string should be compatible with the number of symbols generated.\n\nWait, let's think about the structure. Each step of derivation increases the length by 1 (since each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols: either two non-terminals or a terminal plus something else). Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number of non-terminals in the string.\n\nWait, no. Each production for a non-terminal either produces two non-terminals (in which case the count increases by one) or a terminal and another non-terminal or two terminals. Wait, no, because in CFG, each production replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal or two terminals. Wait, no: in CFG, each production for a non-terminal can only produce a single production, so each non-terminal is replaced by exactly two symbols, which can be either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, no: actually, Chomsky normal form requires that each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So each step replaces one non-terminal with two symbols, which could be a mix of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nThis means that the derivation starts with S, which is a single non-terminal, and with each step, the number of symbols increases by one (since each replacement replaces one symbol with two).\n\nSo the initial string is length 1 (just S). After one step, it's 2 symbols. After another, 3, etc.\n\nOur string has 37 symbols. But S is a single symbol, so 37 symbols would require 36 productions, each adding one symbol. So it's possible, but I need to see if the specific string can be formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more efficient way. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that many parts might correspond to single-terminals, which could have been generated by productions ending with those terminals.\n\nFor example, looking for t2, t26, etc., in the productions. Let me check all productions that end with a 't'.\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT36 \u2192 't32'\n- NT56 \u2192 't36'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26'\n- NT10 \u2192 't10'\n- NT55 \u2192 't25'\n- NT80 \u2192 't26'\n- NT55 \u2192 't41'\n- NT69 \u2192 't85' (Wait, no, NT69 \u2192 't85'?\nWait, looking back: the last productions include NT56 \u2192 't36', NT80 \u2192 't26', etc.\n\nSo for example, NT10 can produce 't26', which might be used to generate the t26 in the string.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the possible parse tree.\n\nFirst, the string is:\n\nt2 t26 t14 t25 t34 t35 t10 t22 t23 t4 t15 t10 t23 t5 t40 t8 t12 t10 t10 t6 t9 t25 t32 t32 t35 t41 t34 t15 t41 t25 t25 t41 t8 t14 t3 t32.\n\nLet me attempt a top-down approach, starting from S.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT9 NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-695","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with a problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is provided, and I have the grammar rules as well. My goal is to figure out whether the string can be obtained by deriving from the start symbol S in the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or two terminals. All productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all the rules are in CNF. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which is two non-terminals, so that's good. Some rules end with a terminal symbol, like NT22 \u2192 't15'. These are terminal symbols, which will correspond to 't' followed by numbers in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t4 t14 t2 t31 t22 t10 t25 t22 t23 t8 t32 t23 t36 t32 t12 t32 t12 t6 t9 t40 t36 t24 t5 t14 t31 t41 t6 t37 t2 t2 t22 t40 t4 t25 t41 t36 t35`.\n\nThis string is a sequence of terminal symbols, each possibly corresponding to a production in the grammar. My approach will be to see if the string can be constructed by applying the grammar rules step by step, perhaps using a parsing strategy like the CYK algorithm or by constructing a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, since each production in CNF splits the derivation into smaller parts, I can attempt to see if the string can be broken down according to these rules.\n\nLet me start by noting that each rule either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since all rules are in CNF, the string must be composed of a sequence of terminals that can be generated by a series of productions. Each production in the grammar either ends with a terminal or continues with non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with 't4', so I need to find a production that ends with 't4'. Looking through the grammar, for example, NT16 \u2192 't37', but that's 't37', not 't4'. NT6 \u2192 't25', which is 't25'. Neither ends with 't4'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT55 -> 't20', but again, that's 't20'. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, I'm not seeing any rule that directly produces 't4'. That's a problem. If the string starts with 't4', and there's no production that directly gives 't4', then the string cannot be generated by the grammar. But maybe 't4' is derived from a longer production.\n\nWait, let me check again. For example, rules like NT4 \u2192 't34'? No, looking more carefully, in the grammar, there's a rule NT4 \u2192 't35', and another NT9 \u2192 't22' and some others.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a production that directly starts with the start symbol and see how the string can be broken down. But starting with 't4' as the string, it seems tricky because no production directly produces 't4'. Alternatively, perhaps the string is built from leftmost derivation, and at some point, the rules allow for the 't4' to appear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing a production. Let me check the grammar again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n- NT85 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT14 \u2192 't23'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't34', 't36'\n\nNo production for NT... that directly gives 't4'. Wait, but looking again, perhaps I overlooked a rule.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT85 -> 't4'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nYes, under the grammar, NT85 \u2192 't4' is present. So S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then NT9 \u2192 't72' and 't23' (from the grammar rules).\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't4', which would have to be produced by some terminal. In the grammar, the only way to get a terminal is if a production directly ends with a terminal. So which non-terminals have productions that end with terminals?\n\nLooking through the grammar, some rules end with 't' followed by numbers, like:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't34', 't36'\n- NT85 \u2192 't4'\n- NT91 (Wait, looking for any other t's)\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nOthers might produce terminals as well, but from the list, I can see:\n\n- NT85 \u2192 't4'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't34', 't36'\n- NT9 \u2192 't72' (which is a non-terminal)\n- NT73 \u2192 't34'\n- And others, but maybe in this case, the only terminals are from NT85 (t4), NT13 (t31), NT22 (t15, t34, t36), NT9 (ends with 't72' which is non-terminal), etc.\n\nSo the first 't4' must come from NT85. So at some point in the derivation, the start symbol S must expand to some NT9 and NT5, which then must eventually produce t4 and t14 perhaps, as the next element is t14.\n\nWait, the string is: t4 t14 t2 t31 t22 t10 t25 t22 t23 t8 t32 t23...\n\nSo the first part is t4 t14. Let me see: t4 comes from NT85 \u2192 't4'. Then t14 comes from NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't34' or 't36'. But in our case, it's 't14', which is not in the options. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, NT14 is a non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT14 has which productions? Checking the list:\n\nThe grammar lists rules under NT14 only as NT14 \u2192 't23', 't8', 't12'. So 't14' is not a terminal in the grammar. Therefore, 't14' is a terminal symbol? Wait, no. Looking at the string: the string has 't14' as a token, but in the grammar, NT14 is a rule that produces terminals. So perhaps 't14' is from another rule.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, no rule directly produces 't14'. Wait, but in the string, we have 't14' appearing early on. So how is that possible using the given grammar?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nThe grammar includes rules like NT14 \u2192 't23', 't8', 't12'. So those are the productions for NT14. None produce 't14' as a terminal symbol. Therefore, the string must have a 't14' as a terminal. But according to the grammar, there's no such rule. That would mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar, because we have a terminal that's not allowed.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the example in the problem is given, and I'm supposed to determine if it is generated. So perhaps I was mistaken in how I'm interpreting the rules.\n\nWait, in the grammar, perhaps the rules are written with '->' indicating the production, and each production's RHS must be two non-terminals or a terminal. So in the string, each token is a terminal, and each must be generated by a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't4', which must come from a production that has 't4' as the terminal symbol. Looking through the grammar, the only rule that produces 't4' is NT85 -> 't4'. So that's possible.\n\nNext token is 't14'. How to get 't14'? Looking at the grammar, no rule directly produces 't14' as a terminal. The NT14 rules produce 't23', 't8', 't1'...

{"custom_id":"request-690","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of terminals, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. In CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems mostly follows this structure, with left-hand sides (LHS) being non-terminals and right-hand sides (RHS) consisting of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNow, the target string is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers. Each of these seems to correspond directly to a production rule in the grammar. For example, \"t2\" corresponds to the production NT22 \u2192 't24'. Wait, no, I think I need to map each \"t\" with a number to the corresponding production.\n\nI'll list out the string components: t5, t25, t2, t6, t3, t8, t14, t9, t22, t32, t15, t4, t35, t23, t23, t20, t9, t24, t4, t2, t20, t25, t41, t31, t36, t35, t35, t10, t26, t25, t31, t3, t35, t25, t9, t10, t15.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. For example, t5 is likely NT0 \u2192 't70 NT80', which produces 't26', but in our string, 't5' appears. Wait, no, I think each \"t\" with a number is a terminal. So 't5' would correspond to a production where the non-terminal expands into 't5'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT13 \u2192 't31', but wait, that's \"t31\". Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, no, let me go through each rule carefully.\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\n- NT22 is defined in multiple places. Looking at the rules:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t22 appearing: 't22', 't22', 't22', 't22', 't22'. Hmm, but wait, looking at the grammar, is there a production for NT22?\n\nYes, in the grammar, NT22 has the productions:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo when would we get a 't22'? It seems 't22' is not directly present as a terminal in any production. Wait, that can't be right because then how does the string contain 't22'? Let me cross-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Looking at the grammar, let me list all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each rule, any that have a string of terminals rather than non-terminals?\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT22 is defined as -> 't15', 't9', 't34'. So NT22 can produce t15, t9, or t34.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'?\nWait, no, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any that directly produce a single 't' with a number:\n\n- NT39 \u2192 't32' \u2192 't3' and 't22'? Wait, no. Let me check each production:\n\nLooking through all the rules, some seem to produce a combination like 't24':\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't3', 't35' \u2192 so NT66 \u2192 t3 t35? Or wait, in the given rules, some RHS are combinations of terminals and non-terminals. Wait, for example:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't41'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT55 \u2192 't43' \u2192 but in the given rules, NT55 is defined as 't43'?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me take a different approach. Each terminal in the string must be produced by a single production rule. So, for each token in the string, like 't5', I need to see if there's a production rule in the grammar that allows that non-terminal to produce that terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce which terminals:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6' (from NT26 \u2192 't25'?

{"custom_id":"request-718","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I suppose represent terminal symbols, and other symbols that might be non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand the structure of the grammar. It looks like the grammar has a start symbol S, which derives into NT9 and NT52. Then, each of those non-terminals might have their own productions. Some of these productions are further broken down until they reach only terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is: t9 t10 t32 t25 t10 t23 t41 t2 t31 t4 t4 t3 t4 t40 t9 t12 t3 t35 t32 t9 t24 t25 t22 t2 t10 t15 t12 t37 t9 t4 t32 t40 t15 t20 t14 t23 t31 t2.\n\nHmm, each symbol is separated by a space, which suggests each 't' followed by a number is a single token. But I'm not entirely sure if each number is a separate digit or part of a multi-digit number. For example, 't10' could be 't' followed by '10', which is a single token, or maybe 't', '1', '0' as separate. But looking at the grammar, some symbols like NT95 are broken down until they reach 't24', which could indicate that 't24' is a terminal symbol. So each 't' followed by a number is likely a single terminal symbol.\n\nSo, the main task is to parse the string according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (each production is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals), I can try to use a recursive descent parsing approach or implement an appropriate parser.\n\nBut manually constructing a parse tree would be time-consuming, especially for a string of this length. Instead, I can look for patterns in the grammar that match the string.\n\nLooking at the first few symbols: t9 t10 t32 t25 t10 t23 t41 t2 t31 t4 t4 t3 t4 t40 t9 t12 t3 t35 t32 t9 t24 t25 t22 t2 t10 t15 t12 t37 t9 t4 t32 t40 t15 t20 t14 t23 t31 t2.\n\nI notice that the grammar has several productions that end in 't' followed by a number. For example, NT5 -> t25, NT10 -> t26, NT22 -> t15, etc. So each NT (like NT5, NT10, etc.) has multiple productions that derive a 't' token.\n\nI also notice that the start symbol S has two initial productions: S \u2192 NT9 NT52 and another production S \u2192 NT52 NT83, which I don't see right away. Wait, looking back, the initial productions are S \u2192 NT9 NT52, then later another S \u2192 NT52 NT83? Wait no, the first line is S -> NT9 NT52. Then, other S productions: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, but I think I misread earlier. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Then there are other productions, but S only has that one as its only production. Hmm, no, actually, looking more carefully, I think S only has that one production at the top. The other productions are for the non-terminals like NT52, NT84, etc., not for S itself. So the initial production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So NT9 and NT52 will each generate parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 can produce NT72 NT23 or directly go to 't2'. NT72 has a production leading to 't35', and NT23 has one leading to 't34'. So the path NT9 \u2192 NT72 \u2192 't35' \u2192 't35' can produce t35, or NT9 could go directly to 't2'. Similarly, NT52 has several productions, including one that goes to 't25', which is present in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few symbols are t9, t10, t32, t25, etc. Let's see how these can be generated.\n\nt9: Looking for NT9 productions. NT9 can produce 't2' directly. Alternatively, NT9 can go to NT72 NT23, which would require both NT72 and NT23 to generate t35 and t34 respectively. But 't9' doesn't fit that. So perhaps the initial production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT52, but how do we get 't9' as the first symbol?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT2 \u2192 't6', NT5 \u2192 't35', etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to find a way to generate t9 from some combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, looking more closely, I notice that NT22 has productions that can produce 't15' and 't9'. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15' or NT22 \u2192 't9'. So if the first symbol is t9, perhaps the derivation uses NT22 \u2192 't9'.\n\nBut how would that happen? Because S \u2192 NT9 NT52, so to get 't9' as the first symbol, one of the non-terminals would have to produce 't9'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing 't9'. All productions for non-terminals seem to end with 't' followed by a number except for possible terminals in the grammar.\n\nWait, but looking again, I see NT22 has a production NT22 \u2192 't9'. So if one of the non-terminals in the S's production branches into NT22, perhaps that can generate 't9' as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the first step is to split S into NT9 and NT52, each generating a part of the string.\n\nLet me try to see how the string could be built. The first symbol is t9, so perhaps NT9 generates t9. But from the grammar, NT9 can either generate 't2' directly or go to NT72 NT23, which would require the next symbols to be t35 (from NT72) and t34 (from NT23), which is not the case here. So perhaps NT9 cannot generate t9 directly, so maybe the initial assumption that S \u2192 NT9 NT52 is used for the first symbol is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the initial productions. The first line says S \u2192 NT9 NT52. There are no other productions for S. So the entire string must be generated by S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the string is the concatenation of the strings derived from NT9 and NT52, in that order.\n\nSo the string is equal to the concatenation of two parts: the part from NT9's derivation and the part from NT52's derivation.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the string:\n\nt9 t10 t32 t25 t10 ... up to t40 t15 t20 t14 t23 t31 t2.\n\nWait, the string is long. So perhaps the first part, from NT9, starts with t9, and the second part from NT52 starts with t10.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions again, it produces 't2' or NT72 NT23. So if NT9 produces 't2', that would give 't2' as the first symbol, but the string starts with 't9'. So that can't be. Alternatively, if NT9 goes to NT72 NT23, then the first two symbols would be from NT72 and NT23.\n\nLooking at NT72: it can produce 't35' directly. So the first symbol from NT72 would be 't35'. But the string starts with 't9', so this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the start symbol S is split differently. Wait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT52, which means S generates the string as the concatenation of NT9's string and NT52's string.

{"custom_id":"request-717","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with a problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has the form S \u2192 AB, where A and B are non-terminals. Another characteristic is that all productions are of the form A \u2192 B C, where B and C are non-terminals or terminals. Wait, but looking at the productions here, I notice that some are in the form S \u2192 NTxxx, but I think the NT here is just a prefix to denote the non-terminals.\n\nWait, no, actually, looking more closely, all the productions have two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, and so on. So the grammar is in CNF, where every production is either a single non-terminal on the left and two non-terminals on the right, or maybe terminals, but in this case, all seem to be non-terminals.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Wait, but in the given grammar, all productions seem to be of the form A \u2192 BC, with B and C being non-terminals (since NT9 is a non-terminal). So that suggests that the grammar doesn't have any terminal symbols in the productions except possibly the end symbols. Hmm, but let me check.\n\nLooking at each production, for example, NT22 \u2192 't15', which means that 't15' is a terminal. Similarly, NT25 \u2192 't16', and others. So the grammar does have terminals in the productions. But in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, so having terminals on the right side is allowed. So that's fine.\n\nNow, the string given is: `t41 t15 t31 t31 t41 t25 t4 t22 t4 t12 t12 t40 t3 t2 t15 t8 t2 t10 t5 t37 t14 t23 t8 t12 t8 t15 t41 t2 t12 t4 t40 t41 t40 t36 t9 t36 t5 t8`.\n\nI need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the number of symbols in the string should be a power of 2 minus 1. Let's check the length of the string. The string has 48 symbols. Wait, 48 is not a power of 2 minus 1. For example, 2^n -1 for n=6 is 63, which is more than 48. Wait, 2^6 -1 is 63, 2^5-1 is 31, 2^4-1 is 15, etc. So 48 is not one less than a power of 2, which means it's impossible for this string to be generated by the given CNF grammar. Because in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, so the number of symbols should start at 1 (for the start symbol S) and double each time. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production can produce a string of length 1 (if terminals) or 2 non-terminals. So starting with one symbol, then two, then up to four, etc. So the total number of symbols in any string derived should be a sum of 1s and multiples of 2, but in the case where the entire string is derived, it would be a number of symbols that can be represented as 2^k for some k, but in this case, 48 is not a power of two. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the correct way is to consider that each step replaces a single non-terminal with two symbols (either two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal, etc.). So starting with S, the length can increase as follows:\n\n- Initial string: 1 symbol.\n\nAfter one step: S could become NT9 NT5, so length 2.\n\nAfter another step, each of those could be replaced, so length could be 4.\n\nThen 8, 16, etc., so the length is 2^n for some n.\n\nWait, 2^n? Or 2^k where k is the number of steps, so the total length is 2^k. So in the given string, the length is 48, which is not equal to 2^k for any integer k. The nearest powers of two are 32 (2^5) and 64 (2^6). So 48 is not a power of two, which means it can't be generated by this grammar. Therefore, the string can't be generated, and the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-738","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. The string to check is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I believe are the terminal symbols generated by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The top-level symbol is S, and S is rewritten as NT9 NT5. So the starting symbol is S, which generates two non-terminal symbols: NT9 and NT5. Each of these needs to be derived into terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT52, NT89, etc., are all non-terminals. Each production breaks these down into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. The base case seems to be productions that end with a single terminal symbol, like NT6 -> 't25' or NT2 -> 't6'.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, like t31, t26, etc. These must be sequences generated by the non-terminals being expanded.\n\nI think the best approach is to use a top-down parsing strategy, starting from S and trying to match the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use the CYK algorithm or a similar method, but maybe I can do it manually here.\n\nLet me list the steps:\n\n1. Start with S -> NT9 NT5.\n2. So the first two symbols should come from NT9 and NT5. Let's check the string: the first token is t31, then t26, then t3, etc. So NT9 should derive to something starting with t31 and t26, but wait, NT9 is a non-terminal, and each production of NT9 should produce a combination of two symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT9:\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n\nWait, NT9 can produce NT72 NT23. Then NT72 and NT23 are non-terminals. Looking at the productions for NT72, I see NT72 -> 't35', so that terminal. For NT23, which is another production: NT23 -> NT93 NT22.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I should build a parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should represent the string as a list and see if I can apply the grammar rules step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t31, t26, t3, t12, t12, t8, t25, t10, t20, t10, t37, t22, t34, t4, t34, t26, t2, t4, t37, t10, t5, t5, t20, t22, t3, t14, t24, t35, t3, t37, t35, t36, t24, t35, t2, t25, t32, t15, t26]\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Start with S -> NT9 NT5.\n- So the string must be generated by NT9 followed by NT5.\n- So the first part of the string is derived from NT9, and the second part from NT5.\n\nLet's check NT9 and NT5 productions.\n\nNT9 can produce NT72 NT23 or NT95, etc. Wait, from the productions:\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23.\n\nSo NT9 is expanded into NT72 NT23. Looking at NT72's production: NT72 -> 't35'.\n\nSo the first symbol t31 must come from NT72, but wait, NT72 is 't35' directly. So in the string, the first token is t31, but according to the production, it's 't35'. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Wait, S produces NT9 and NT5, so the first part is derived from NT9, which might be a multi-symbol production.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the productions are two-step. So NT9 could produce something like NT72 NT23, which would be t35 followed by whatever NT23 produces.\n\nBut in the string, the first part is t31, which doesn't match t35. So perhaps the initial step doesn't match, meaning the string is not generated by this grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong productions.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again. NT95 -> NT10 NT11. So NT95 could produce NT10 NT11. NT10 -> 't26', which matches the second token in the string, which is t26. But the first token is t31, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm considering the wrong order. Maybe S's two daughters are not both needed to be generated at once, but perhaps the string is split into two parts, each starting with one of the daughters of S.\n\nWait, S -> NT9 NT5. So the entire string must be derived from NT9 followed by NT5. So the string is split into two parts: the first part is derived from NT9, and the second part is derived from NT5.\n\nSo the string starts with t31, which is the first symbol. Let's see if t31 can be derived from NT9 or NT5.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT23 -> NT93 NT22\n\nSo starting with NT9, we get NT72 (t35) followed by NT23. NT23 becomes NT93 NT22. Now, NT93 has several productions:\n\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT93 -> NT79 NT42\n- NT93 -> NT6 NT14\n\nLet's see if any of these can lead to the next part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string: t31, t26, t3, t12, etc.\n\nWait, t31 is supposed to come from NT9. Let's see if any of the productions for NT9 can contain t31 as a terminal. From the productions of NT9, none directly produce a t31. NT9's daughters lead to t35, then NT23 leads to something else. So perhaps my initial assumption about NT9 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that NT5 could produce some part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT5: which productions do NT5 have? Let's check the given grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT52 -> NT89 NT35\n- NT69 -> NT88 NT26\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT52 -> NT60 NT81\n- NT52 -> NT64 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT56 -> NT36 NT95\n- etc.\n\nWait, I see productions for NT5, but I'm probably missing some. Let me check again.

The grammar is a series of production rules starting from S. Each rule on the left side (e.g., S ->NT9 NT5) defines how a non-terminal can be expanded. Since it's in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the right side. The string given consists of terminal symbols, including `t` followed by numbers and some `t` followed by letters like t24, t15, etc.\n\nI think a good way to approach this is to parse the string using the grammar, trying to find a sequence of productions that can derive the string step by step.\n\nBut wait, the string is quite long. It's 67 tokens long. Each production step would expand two non-terminals into one token. Starting from S, which is a non-terminal, each application of a production rule would build the string. The length of the string should give me an idea of how many steps I need. Each step adds one token because each rule produces two non-terminals, and each non-terminal becomes one token. Wait no, that's not correct. Each production replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals, so each step from a non-terminal to its two children increases the number of symbols by one. But the terminal symbols are at the leaves.\n\nWait, let me think about how many symbols would be generated. Starting with S, each production splits it into two non-terminals. So the number of symbols in the string would be 2^n after n production steps, where n is the number of splittings. But wait, this depends on the structure.\n\nAlternatively, each step from a non-terminal to two non-terminals adds one more token. So the length of the string is determined by how many non-terminals split. For example, if we start with S and each step splits non-terminals into two, the total number of terminals would be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. But in this case, the string has a certain number of terminals. So I need to check whether 67 is a power of 2. 64 is 2^6, and 128 is 2^7. Since 67 is not a power of 2, perhaps the string is invalid. Hmm, that seems promising.\n\nWait, but that might not always be the case. The number of terminals could vary depending on the productions. So maybe a better approach is to check the number of splits required to generate the string. The number of symbols in the string should be 2^k - 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the number of symbols isn't a perfect power of 2, it might indicate that the string can't be generated.\n\nBut let me compute the number of terminals here. The given string has 67 tokens like `t5`, `t12`, etc. Let's count them. For example, the string starts with t5, t12, t10, t10, t4, etc. Let me count:\n\n1. t5\n2. t12\n3. t10\n4. t10\n5. t4\n6. t36\n7. t20\n8. t25\n9. t26\n10. t5\n11. t2\n12. t20\n13. t25\n14. t35\n15. t5\n16. t23\n17. t4\n18. t40\n19. t15\n20. t22\n21. t10\n22. t15\n23. t41\n24. t8\n25. t15\n26. t23\n27. t35\n28. t5\n29. t2\n30. t32\n31. t41\n32. t9\n33. t9\n34. t2\n35. t35\n36. t41\n37. t10\n38. t41\n39. t34.\n\nSo that's 39 tokens. Hmm, 39 is not a power of 2. Because 32 is 2^5, 64 is 2^6. So 39 is in between, which doesn't fit the pattern of a fully expanded CNF grammar, where the number of terminals is 2^k.\n\nAdditionally, the number of splits would have to result in a number that is one less than a power of two because each split increases the count by one. For example, starting with 1 (S), each split adds one, so after k splits, the count is 2^k. But since the terminal symbols are derived, maybe it's 2^k - 1. However, that doesn't perfectly fit here because 39 + 1 is 40, which isn't a power of two either.\n\nThis suggests that the string might not be generated by the grammar because the number of terminals doesn't fit the expected pattern. But I should check if the non-terminals can be expanded all the way down to the terminals without any issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the tokens:\n\nI'll list them out:\n\n1. t5\n2. t12\n3. t10\n4. t10\n5. t4\n6. t36\n7. t20\n8. t25\n9. t26\n10. t5\n11. t2\n12. t20\n13. t25\n14. t35\n15. t5\n16. t23\n17. t4\n18. t40\n19. t15\n20. t22\n21. t10\n22. t15\n23. t41\n24. t8\n25. t15\n26. t23\n27. t35\n28. t5\n29. t2\n30. t32\n31. t41\n32. t9\n33. t9\n34. t2\n35. t35\n36. t41\n37. t10\n38. t41\n39. t34.\n\nYes, 39 tokens. So that's definitely not a power of 2. That seems like a strong indicator that the string isn't generated by this grammar because in a typical context-free grammar, especially in CNF, the number of terminal symbols after derivation should be a power of two. So 39 isn't a power of two, making it unlikely that the grammar can produce this string.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the string is generated by some other means, but given the structure of the grammar and the rules, the length of the string should conform to the production rules. If the grammar's leftmost derivation produces a string that's a power of two, any other derivation should also respect that, depending on the structure.\n\nTherefore, considering the number of terminal symbols isn't a power of two, my conclusion is that the string isn't generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of tX where each X is a number, and I think each tX represents a terminal symbol in the grammar. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a where a is a terminal. This is helpful because it simplifies parsing and allows for certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is provided and I might not be able to apply CYK directly, I need another approach.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it's heavily recursive with many non-terminals expanding into other non-terminals or terminals. The start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, to produce the string, the start symbol must expand through various steps into the given t tokens.\n\nThe string is: t8 t35 t6 t5 t25 t31 t10 t31 t40 t20 t12 t4 t25 t5 t26 t34 t32 t3 t8 t15 t25 t20 t3 t35 t15 t12 t22 t25 t15 t37 t34 t14 t22 t8 t34 t31 t36 t10 t34 t34.\n\nEach tX is a terminal, so the entire string must be derived by a sequence of productions in the grammar that eventually reduce all non-terminals to these terminals.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and see how they might produce the required terminals. For example, NT10 \u2192 't26', NT15 \u2192 't4', etc. So, any occurrence of t26 would have to come from NT10, t4 from NT15, etc. \n\nI need to check each t in the string and see if there's a non-terminal that directly produces it. Let's go through the string step by step.\n\nStart with the first t. It's t8. Looking at the grammar, where is 't8' a terminal? Scanning through the production rules, I see NT83 \u2192 't4', NT88 \u2192 't5', NT13 \u2192 't31', NT12 \u2192 't10', NT28 \u2192 't10', NT39 \u2192 't8', and NT42 \u2192 't24', NT63 \u2192 't32'... Wait, I also see NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'. NT25 \u2192 't25' directly. NT35 \u2192 't35' directly. \n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t8. So, which NT rule produces t8? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for 't8' in the RHS of the rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 NT10 NT26, NT66 \u2192 NT3 NT66, etc. That doesn't produce t8. Wait, let me check each production where RHS includes a terminal.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> t83, t16. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT28 \u2192 t10 and t26. So, t8 doesn't come directly from any single NT. Wait, maybe from a composite production? Hmm, no, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look again. Let me go through each rule and see if any of them have a terminal on the RHS.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT83 \u2192 t4 (so if NT83 ever appears, it becomes t4)\n- NT88 \u2192 t5\n- NT13 \u2192 t31\n- NT12 \u2192 t10\n- NT28 \u2192 t10 and t26\n- NT39 \u2192 t8 (Ah, here we go! NT39 \u2192 't8' directly. So, the first t8 in the string must come from NT39 expanding to t8.\n\nSo, the first part: NT39 \u2192 t8. Then, the next is t35. Looking for t35, which would come from NT35 \u2192 t35 directly. So, the second t35 must come from NT35 \u2192 t35.\n\nThird t is t6. Looking for a production that leads to t6. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT36 \u2192 t41\n- NT66 \u2192 t3 (Wait, no, NT66 \u2192 't3', but in the string, it's t3? Wait, no, our string has t3 as part of t36 \u2192 t41? Hmm. Wait, perhaps my initial scan was wrong.\n\nWait, in the string, after t35 comes t6, t5, etc. So, t6 must be produced by a production that includes t6 as a terminal. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t73, t25 => no t6\n- NT36 \u2192 t41, but no. Wait, maybe NT6 is produced? NT6 \u2192 t25, so no.\n\nWait, is there any NT that directly produces t6? Let me check the rules again:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t25, but that's it. Wait, then how do we get t6?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a production. Let me recheck. The rules list includes:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT26 \u2192 't73', 't25'\n- NT36 \u2192 't41' (But also see NT36 \u2192 t36: Wait no, looking at NT15's rule: NT15 \u2192 t4. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me list all the rules with terminals.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT27 \u2192 t24 (Wait, NT27 is a terminal? No, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for rules where RHS has a terminal.

So, the third token is t6, which would come from NT2 \u2192 't6'.\n\nSo, the first three tokens are t8, t35, t6, which come from NT39 \u2192 t8, NT35 \u2192 t35, and NT2 \u2192 t6. So the first three steps would be NT39 expanding into t8, but wait, NT39 itself is a non-terminal. So how does NT39 get to t8? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because NT39 is a non-terminal, it must expand into other non-terminals until it reaches terminals. So, NT39 must expand into something else that eventually becomes t8. So, looking at NT39's rule: NT39 \u2192 t36 NT96. So, NT39 expands into 't36' and NT96.\n\nHmm, so the first t in the string is t8, which is derived from NT39 \u2192 t36 NT96. But wait, that would mean the token sequence for NT39 is 't36' followed by NT96. So the first token after NT39's expansion would be t36, unless NT96 produces a different terminal or non-terminal.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t8. So that suggests that the expansion of NT39 leads directly to t8, which isn't possible because NT39 \u2192 t36 NT96. Unless I'm misunderstanding the order. Wait, in Chomsky Normal Form, the RHS is in the order written, so the string would be t36 followed by NT96 expanding. So, t36 is the first terminal, then whatever NT96 generates. So, the first token in the string is t8, which would come from NT8 \u2192 t8? Or wait, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nWait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me try to parse the entire string by breaking it down. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps a recursive descent approach could help. Alternatively, I can try to construct a tree or a sequence of steps that derive the string.\n\nBut this might get too complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a series of 't' tokens, and the grammar has various rules that expand non-terminals into combinations of other non-terminals and eventually into terminal symbols. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. CNF grammars have each production rule on the left side generating exactly two non-terminals or one terminal. All productions are left-disjointed, meaning no non-terminal appears on both sides of a production. The provided grammar seems to fit that structure, with rules like S -> NT9 NT5, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is \"t41 t31 t37 t34 t20 t32 t9 t23 t2 t5 t8 t10 t2 t35 t3 t41 t8 t20 t10 t4 t40 t9 t4 t32 t22 t35 t9 t40 t8 t40 t36 t6 t10 t40 t14 t15 t4 t31 t12 t8\". I notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so the string is composed of such terminals. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the string length should be 2^n + 1 for some n, as each step in the derivation doubles the number of symbols. Let's see: the string has 37 't' symbols. 37 is an odd number, but let's check if it fits 2^n + 1. Let's calculate:\n\n2^5 = 32, 32+1=33, which is less than 37.\n2^6=64, 64+1=65, which is more than 37. So, 37 doesn't fit this pattern, meaning the string might not be possible under CNF grammar derivations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar allows for the number of steps to be such that the string length is different. But CNF typically generates strings of length 2^n, starting from the initial symbol. Let's think about the initial productions: S is broken into two parts, so each application of productions will double the number of symbols. For example, S (1) \u2192 two parts (2). Each of those could branch further, so after n steps, you have 2^n symbols. \n\nIn this case, the string has 37 symbols. 37 is not a power of two. 2^5=32, 2^6=64. So unless the string is empty or counts as 1, 37 doesn't fit. The initial symbol S can derive sequences of length 2^k, but 37 isn't a power of two or one more. Wait, maybe it's one more because S can derive into two symbols and then one step can add one more. No, even that might not make it 37.\n\nWait, perhaps I should count the number of symbols. The string has 37 't' tokens separated by spaces, making 37 symbols. Let me recount: 1 (t41), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. So 37 't' symbols. \n\nAs CNF grammars generate words of length 2^n starting from S, unless the start symbol S can derive into a terminal directly in some cases, but in this grammar, looking at the start symbol S: S -> NT9 NT5. So S can't produce a single terminal, it must go through two non-terminals. Therefore, the minimum string length derived from S would be two terminals. \n\nWait, so each application of a production in CNF either keeps the same length or increases it by one in the case of a single terminal. So the total length after k steps would be 2^k. Wait, no, wait: starting from S (length 1 as a symbol), each production's expansion doubles the number of non-terminals, but only if the production is split into two. However, some productions might terminate into a terminal, so a single terminal would add to the length. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of how the derivation works. Starting from S, which is a single symbol, and each step replaces a symbol with a production. If a production is a terminal, it contributes one symbol. If it's two non-terminals, it contributes two symbols, but each non-terminal can further expand. \n\nThe minimal string from S would be when each production in the derivation results in terminals. So for S, the first step could be NT9 -> (a bunch of terminals) and NT5 -> (another bunch). But to get the minimal possible length, suppose NT9 expands into a single terminal and NT5 into another. Then the string would be two symbols. But given the grammar, it's more complicated because each NT has their own productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string length isn't the issue, but more about the structure of the string matching the possible derivation. Since I can't easily compute all possible expansions, perhaps I should look for patterns or problematic parts of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, I see some repeated 't's like t20, t23, etc. But I need to check if the grammar allows for that. For example, if a production leads to t20 and t8 in combination, I need to see if they appear together.\n\nLooking at the grammar, t20 can be generated by NT26 -> 't26'? Wait, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like:\n\nNT26 -> 't26', which is a terminal. So NT26 can be expanded directly to t26.\n\nLooking for t15 in the string: it's at the end. The rule for NT22 is either 't15' or 't9'. So when NT22 is expanded, it could become 't15' (t15) or 't9' (another symbol). So in the string, at the end, there's 't15' and 't9' and 't40', etc.\n\nWait, let me parse the string step by step. The string is:\n\nt41 t31 t37 t34 t20 t32 t9 t23 t2 t5 t8 t10 t2 t35 t3 t41 t8 t20 t10 t4 t40 t9 t4 t32 t22 t35 t9 t40 t8 t40 t36 t6 t10 t40 t14 t15 t4 t31 t12 t8.\n\nI notice that some of these are terminals, so they must be direct productions from non-terminals. For instance, t41 comes from some NT41? Wait, in the grammar, I don't see NT41 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps t22 is NT22. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, in the rules provided, there are several NTs that expand into terminals. For example:\n\nNT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n\nNT26 -> 't26'\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nDT4 (maybe, but let me check) No, the rules are such that non-terminals can expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nLooking for 't' in the grammar, it's mostly from certain NTs:\n\nNT26 -> 't26'\n\nNT22 can be 't15' or 't9'\n\nNT9 -> 't72' or 't23', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if it follows any expansion:\n\nLooking at t41 t31 t37 t34 t20: These are all 't's, which must come from NTs expanding into them.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, do any NTs expand into t41? Looking through the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT that expands into t41. It doesn't seem so. For example, in the grammar, NT25 -> 't25' (t25). Wait, no, looking through:\n\nWait, let me check each rule for terminal expansions:\n\nNT22 -> 't15' or 't9'\n\nNT26 -> 't26'\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT4 -> 't35'\n\nNT84 -> 't5'\n\nWait, looking through, I only see t26, t15, t9, t25, t4, t35, t5, etc., as direct terminals.\n\nBut the string has t41"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal on the left. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Looking at the productions, they all seem to consist of non-terminals on the left and combinations of two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right. For example, S -> NT9 NT5, which means S can be replaced by NT9 followed by NT5. Each non-terminal then further breaks down into other non-terminals, some of which eventually lead to terminals like 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which seems to be the result of all non-terminals being replaced by their respective terminal sequences. So, the task is to check if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the string is quite long, doing it step by step might be tedious, but let's see if any parts of the string correspond to the known terminal outputs of non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, many of them result in specific two-character strings like 'tX'. For example, NT85 produces 't4', so if any part of the string is 't4', we can check if that corresponds to NT85.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice sequences like 't41 t4' towards the end. Looking back to the grammar, I see that NT24 has several productions, including one that outputs 't24' when NT6 is present. Also, NT6 produces 't25' and 't16'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT6 is actually a non-terminal and on line NT66 -> 't3', so NT66 directly produces 't3'.\n\nWait, let's check the production rules for each non-terminal that could output a terminal. For example, NT55 -> 't20' and NT88 -> 't5', etc.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the given string as a sequence of terminal symbols and see if they can be generated by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number corresponds to the result of a non-terminal, so we can traverse the string in parts, each part being the result of a non-terminal.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminal symbols:\n`t41, t6, t3, t3, t9, t6, t40, t5, t36, t8, t32, t9, t3, t25, t24, t12, t15, t22, t6, t35, t6, t35, t40, t24, t31, t5, t14, t24, t25, t14, t3, t5, t8, t41, t4, t22, t36, t31, t34, t2, t4`\n\nNow, each of these terminals is a specific two-character string. Let's start from the beginning and see if there's a non-terminal that can produce 't41'. Looking through the terminal productions, I see that NT41 doesn't exist. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT4 is a non-terminal that produces 't35' in NT4 -> NT83 NT96 and another production NT4 -> NT83 NT96 with a different result. Wait, no, the terminal in NT4 is 't35'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, for example, NT66 -> 't3', but I'm looking for 't41'. Checking all the terminal productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't41'. Hmm, that might be an issue because if the first character can't be generated by any non-terminal, then the string can't be derived.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I missed it. Let's check each production line:\n\n- NT8 -> NT73 NT78\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT35 -> NT42 NT87\n- NT42 -> NT12 NT56\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT43\n- NT43 -> NT0 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT70 NT80\n- NT70 -> NT78 NT28\n- NT10 -> NT84 NT25\n- NT88 -> NT21 NT13\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n\nWait, I don't see a non-terminal that produces 't41' directly. So perhaps that's a problem. Maybe 't41' is part of a larger production. But given that the terminal strings are two characters, perhaps combinations of non-terminals can generate longer strings. Wait, no, the string is a list of 't' strings each followed by a number, but each 't' is part of the expanded non-terminals. So, each of these 't3', 't4', etc., are the results of specific non-terminals. So if 't41' is in the string, it must be produced by a non-terminal that can produce that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The string is a list of terminal symbols, each being 't' followed by a number, like t41, t6, etc. Each of these corresponds to a specific non-terminal's production that ends with that terminal.\n\nFor example, in the grammar, NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT10 -> 't26', but looking through the productions, perhaps NT95 is NT95 -> NT10 NT89 and another production. Wait, maybe I need to look up the exact production paths.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: if the string can be parsed according to the grammar, each part must match a production rule. Since it's a long string, it's impractical to do by hand, but perhaps we can check some of the initial parts.\n\nThe string starts with 't41 t6 t3 t3 t9 t6 t40 t5...'. So the first element is 't41'. If none of the non-terminals produce 't41', then this string cannot be generated.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions, do any non-terminals produce 't41'? Scanning each terminal rule:\n\n- NT8 -> 't73' and 't78'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT42 -> 't12', 't56'\n- NT4 -> 't83', 't96'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT36 -> 't27', 't43'\n- NT43 -> 't0', 't9'\n- NT0 -> 't70', 't80'\n- NT70 -> 't78', 't28'\n- NT10 -> 't84', 't25'\n- NT88 -> 't21', 't13'\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT24 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n\nI don't see any 't41' being produced.

{"custom_id":"request-770","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I'm supposed to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t10 t2 t12 t3 t23 t5 t9 t2 t31 t35 t35 t24 t15 t12 t10 t26 t4 t8 t41 t6 t12 t31 t31 t3 t14 t26 t15 t24 t15 t26 t36 t37 t23 t24 t14 t35 t25 t2 t41 t10 t23`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing and analysis manageable.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. The NT (Nonterminals) are all the capital letters, and the terminals are the lowercase 't' followed by numbers, like t10, t2, etc. \n\nThe string provided is a series of these terminals, each separated by a space. My job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI think the approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the parse tree would naturally split into two parts at each non-terminal. \n\nLet me sketch the structure. S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the string should start with the symbols generated by NT9 and then NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t10, which would correspond to the production of NT9 or NT5.\n\nI know that NT9 can produce t9 via some chain of productions, but let me check. NT9's productions are not directly given, but I can see that NT9 has rules like NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which eventually leads to t10 and t11. Wait, but here the string starts with t10, so perhaps the path is NT9 \u2192 ... \u2192 t10.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the rules, NT9 is part of several productions. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which is a terminal. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map each step. Let's note the order of the string: t10, t2, t12, t3, t23, t5, t9, t2, t31, t35, t35, t24, t15, t12, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look for the possible productions that can generate these sequences.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the first part is NT9, and the second part is NT5.\n\nNT9: Looking at the grammar, NT9 is involved in several productions, like NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that doesn't seem to help. Alternatively, NT93 can lead to t9 and t3? Wait, no. Let me check for NT9's productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see a direct rule for NT9. Instead, NT9 might be part of longer chains. For example, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. Then, NT16 \u2192 t37, and NT5 \u2192 t16? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps NT9 can be derived through more steps. But I'm not seeing a direct path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. NT93 is a production, but the only rule for NT93 is in lines like NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 and so on. Wait, actually, looking at the rules, I have to see how NT9 can be derived. It seems NT9 is used in some productions, but perhaps NT9 itself isn't a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the terminal symbols are the 't' followed by numbers, like t10, t2, etc. So all other capital letters are non-terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, each non-terminal must expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals according to their rules.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it expands into NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, the first part of the string must be generated by NT9, and the second part by NT5.\n\nLooking at the first part of the string, the first symbol is t10. So, what can produce t10? Looking through the rules, NT52 has a rule NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong. Alternatively, perhaps NT10 is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, I need to clarify which non-terminals produce terminals. For example, 't10' is a terminal, so what non-terminal can directly produce it?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT55 \u2192 't20', NT56 \u2192 't36', NT82 \u2192 't10', among others. Wait, so NT82 \u2192 't10'. So if NT82 is a non-terminal that can produce 't10', that would be a way to get t10.\n\nWait, in the string, the first symbol is t10, which comes from NT82. So, the first production of NT82 is needed.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, NT82 is defined as NT82 \u2192 't10' and perhaps another rule. Let me check: the rules include NT82: NT82 \u2192 't6', NT28, etc.? No, looking through the grammar, I don't see NT82 having another production except NT82 \u2192 't6' and others.\n\nWait, no, looking again: I see lines like NT82 \u2192 't10' and NT28 \u2192 't15', etc. So, it seems some non-terminals are directly assigned to terminals. So, for example, NT55 \u2192 't20', NT69 \u2192 't85', etc.\n\nSo, 't10' would come directly from a production like NT82 \u2192 't10'.\n\nSo, to get t10 as the first symbol, the NT9 part must eventually reduce to 't10' via NT82. So, how can NT9 derive into NT82?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see NT9 directly connected to NT82. So maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps NT9 can reach NT82 through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, to produce the string, the first part needs to come from NT9 expanding into 't10' via some path, and the second part from NT5.\n\nBut right now, the first symbol is 't10', which suggests that the first non-terminal, NT9, must expand into 't10' via some path.\n\nLooking at NT9, are there any direct rules to terminals? I don't see any. So, I must check if NT9 can reach 't10' through productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, perhaps NT9 can be derived via a chain of non-terminals. For example, NT91 \u2192 't23', but that doesn't help. Wait, perhaps using NT93 or NT95.\n\nLooking at NT93: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and then NT16 \u2192 't37', and NT5 could be broken down further. Wait, but NT5 isn't a terminal. So perhaps that's not the way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT93 again: it's possible that NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42. Then, NT79 \u2192 't2' and NT42 \u2192 't6'. Hmm, but that's 't2' 't6', which is 't2t6', but the string starts with t10, which is longer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if there's any NT that can produce 't10'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I notice that NT82 \u2192 't10' directly. So if somewhere in the expansion, an NT82 appears, it can produce t10.\n\nSo, the start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nLet's consider that NT9 can derive into NT82. How?\n\nLooking for a way from NT9 to NT82.\n\nNT9 might have productions that expand into other non-terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 NT79 NT4. Wait, but NT79 can be 't2' or further. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps NT93 is a route. NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. Then NT16 \u2192 't37', but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, NT91 \u2192 't23', which is a terminal. So, that would give 't23'. But the first symbol is 't10', which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule where NT9 leads into another non-terminal that eventually produces 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-791","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has several production rules, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammar has rules where each non-terminal either produces two terminals or another non-terminal. This makes parsing easier, but generating a string can be tricky. Since the string is provided in terms of terminals (all the tokens are 't' followed by numbers), I need to see if there's a series of productions that can generate this sequence.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's mostly about replacing non-terminals with pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. Some of the productions directly map to terminal symbols, like `NT22 -> 't15'`, `NT22 -> 't9'`, and others. So, each time a non-terminal like NT22 appears in a production, it can expand to either 't15' or 't9'.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is a sequence of these 't' terms. The first step is to parse this string and see if I can track back to the root symbol S using the productions.\n\nLet me write out the string for clarity:\n\n`t14 t3 t31 t15 t4 t14 t10 t14 t24 t10 t6 t31 t24 t6 t2 t5 t14 t41 t2 t3 t9 t12 t37 t35 t10 t15 t32 t4 t32 t32 t23 t35 t9 t24 t20 t9 t8 t34 t40 t35 t8 t2`\n\nThat's a total of 45 tokens. Each token like 't14' is a terminal symbol. To generate this string, the grammar must have a path where each non-terminal expansion leads to the correct sequence of terminals.\n\nStarting from S, the first production is S -> NT9 NT5. So, the string starts with the concatenation of what NT9 and NT5 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 has a production `NT9 -> NT5 -> 't22'`. Wait, no, let me check. NT9's rules are:\n\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n... and others, but looking at NT9 specifically, I think I need to check each rule. Wait, no, the list provided includes NT9 as having several rules, but I don't see a direct rule for NT9. Wait, let's re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, actually, in the provided grammar, the non-terminals are like NT52, NT84, etc., and the productions are each taking two non-terminals and expanding them. For example, S -> NT9 NT5. So, NT9 and NT5 are each non-terminals that can be expanded further using other rules.\n\nLooking at NT9, I don't see a direct production rule. So maybe I need to check further down. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look again.\n\nThe grammar is long, so I need to make sure I don't miss any rule. Let me go through the NT9 rules:\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see:\n\n- NT89 -> NT72 NT83\n- NT72 -> NT72 NT23 (or others?)\nWait, actually, I think NT9 has a rule that I might have missed. Wait, looking through the list, I see NT89 -> NT72 NT83, but that's for NT89, not NT9. Oh, I think I need to look for all the production rules for NT9.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- There's a rule `NT9 -> NT72 NT23`? Let me check the list: No, the closest is `NT72 -> NT72 NT23` under other non-terminals. Hmm, maybe NT9's rules are not directly given. Oh, wait, perhaps I was wrong. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong because NT9 isn't listed as a non-terminal that has its own production rules except through others. So, maybe NT9 is produced by another non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps I missed it. Wait, maybe NT9 doesn't have its own rules except through the combinations. I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, the non-terminals seem to be defined in the form NTx, with various production rules. So, each rule is like NT52 -> NT89 NT5, etc. So, for example, NT9 may be produced by a higher-level non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the list again, I realize that NT9 isn't listed as a non-terminal with its own production rules. For example, NT14 -> 't23', NT22 has some rules. So, perhaps S is the top, and the first step is S -> NT9 NT5, but then I need to see what NT9 and NT5 produce.\n\nWait, perhaps NT9 itself doesn't have any production except in a rule like `NT98 -> NT58 NT18`, but not directly. So perhaps I need to backtrack or consider that NT9 is part of a larger production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this by trying to see if each non-terminal can be expanded into the given string, starting from S and working my way down.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, looking for possible expansions that match the terminals.\n\nThe string starts with `t14 t3 t31 t15 t4 t14 t10 t14 t24 t10 t6 t31 t24 t6 t2 t5 t14 t41 t2 t3 t9 t12 t37 t35 t10 t15 t32 t4 t32 t32 t23 t35 t9 t24 t20 t9 t8 t34 t40 t35 t8 t2`.\n\nWait, that's 45 tokens. Each token is a 't' followed by a number. So each of these must correspond to the terminals produced by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nStarting from S, which is NT9 and NT5. So, I need to see what NT9 and NT5 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT5:\n\nFrom the grammar, looking for NT5's production rules. The available productions are, among others:\n\n- NT52 -> NT89 NT5 (probably not NT5)\n- NT56 -> NT36 NT95\n- NT25 -> 't25', NT49 -> 't8', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT5's own productions. From the list:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT56 -> NT36 NT95\n- NT64 -> NT15 NT22\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36' (from NT56 -> NT36 NT95, and then NT36 might expand further)\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe looking at the start, S is NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, the string must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT9 and NT5.\n\nBut looking at the string's first token is 't14', which is one of the terminals. So, either NT9 or NT5 must start with a rule that produces 't14' as the first symbol.\n\nLooking at the NT9 rules, if any production of NT9 starts with a terminal, that could be 't14'. Alternatively, looking at NT5's rules.\n\nLooking for NT9 rules:\n\nWait, I think I missed some NT9 rules.

Wait, but in the provided list, I don't see any NT9 production rules except maybe in a higher-level.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar structure.

{"custom_id":"request-799","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is quite long and consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has productions where each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar rules, I see that most of the productions indeed are of the form NT followed by two NTs, except for the ones ending with a terminal like 't24' or 't25'. These are the terminal symbols.\n\nThe goal is to see if the given string can be derived starting from the start symbol, which appears to be S. The string starts with 't35' and ends with 't25', which suggests that the string is a sequence of terminals generated from the non-terminals.\n\nMy approach will be to work backward from the string. Since each production in CNF either has two non-terminals or a single terminal, the string must be built by decomposing it into segments that match the possible productions.\n\nLet me list out the steps I'll take:\n\n1. **Identify the terminals in the string**: Each segment is a 't' followed by a number, like 't35', 't20', etc.\n\n2. **Check if each segment is a terminal in the grammar**: The terminals in the grammar are the ones listed, such as 't24', 't25', 't35', etc.\n\n3. **Attempt to decompose the string into the grammar's productions**:\n   - Start from the left, looking at possible pairs of terminals that might form a production.\n   - For each possible pair, see if there's a production that generates that pair via non-terminals.\n   - If a pair can't be matched, maybe the string can't be generated.\n\n4. **Recursive decomposition**: Break down the string into smaller chunks until reaching atomic terminals.\n\nLet me go through the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t35 t20 t9 t4 t25 t15 t41 t2 t8 t8 t22 t12 t4 t14 t22 t40 t9 t25 t12 t40 t4 t15 t36 t36 t14 t26 t9 t26 t5 t23 t25 t31 t2 t23 t36 t35 t5 t6 t8 t6 t25 t2`\n\nI'll start by looking for the beginning.\n\nThe first part is 't35 t20'. Looking at the grammar, NT78 has a production to 't35' and 't24' which isn't helpful here. Wait, looking at the productions, I see that NT66 produces 't3' and perhaps other terminals when combined with NTs.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a production that has 't35' as part of a pair. Let's see: the production NT73 \u2192 NT67 NT78, but I don't see that directly. Alternatively, perhaps a production where two NTs produce a terminal and another NT. Maybe I should look for a production that starts with 't35' or has 't35' in its terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I notice that NT73 \u2192 NT37 NT40. Then, checking NT37, according to the rules: NT37 \u2192 NT64 NT96. Wait, that's not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look from the end of the string. Let me try that approach.\n\nLooking at the end: the last part is 't25'. Checking the grammar, NT55 \u2192 NT85 NT52 and also NT55 \u2192 't20'. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Alternatively, NT10 has 't26' and 't25' as options. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Since each production is in CNF, the string must decompose into a tree where each internal node is a production with two children, and leaves are terminals.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I should look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT52 NT95.\n\nLet me note that S is the start, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT52 NT95.\n\nSo, the string must be produced by NT52 and NT95. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT95's production: Looking through the grammar, NT95's productions are:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, NT21 NT4, etc. Wait, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 is one option, and another is NT21 NT4.\n\nWait, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 NT21 NT4\n- NT21 \u2192 NT86 NT27\n- NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96\n- Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for NT52. NT52's productions are:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT69 NT81, NT56 NT82, NT60 NT83, etc. Looking for something that can produce 't35 t20' etc.\n\nWait, maybe NT52 can produce 't35' and 't20'. Let me check if there's a production for NT52 that includes these.\n\nLooking at NT52\u2019s rules: Oh, look, there's NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, and another rule where NT52 \u2192 't35' and 't24'? Wait, no, actually, looking at the provided grammar, NT37 \u2192 NT73 NT40, etc. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT42 is involved because NT42 produces 't24'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try another approach: Check each part for possible matches.\n\nThe first token is 't35', which appears in NT93: looking through the grammar, I see NT93 has multiple productions. Wait, no, looking at NT93:\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT93 has:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT24 (terminal)\n- But in the grammar, NT66 \u2192 't3', but that's not helpful here. Alternatively, NT93 produces 't79' as in one of the rules: Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if the entire string can be broken down step by step.\n\nLooking at 't35 t20 t9 t4 t25 t15 t41 t2 t8 t8 t22 t12 t4 t14 t22 t40 t9 t25 t12 t40 t4 t15 t36 t36 t14 t26 t9 t26 t5 t23 t25 t31 t2 t23 t36 t35 t5 t6 t8 t6 t25 t2'\n\nI need to see if this can be split into a series of productions involving two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to generate all possible steps and see if the string can be reduced step by step to the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the longest possible substrings that can be matched by the grammar rules.\n\nBut that might take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be parsed by building a parse tree step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's faster to look for the structure starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't35 t20'. Let's see if there's any production that starts with 't35'. Looking at the grammar rules, the terminal 't35' is produced by NT73 \u2192 't35' and NT66 \u2192 't25' (Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT36 \u2192 't36' is one of the rules, but perhaps not relevant).\n\nWait, wait, looking at the grammar rules provided, I see that NT36 \u2192 't36' is a production. But in the string, 't35' and 't20' are in the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me see if I can find any production that has 't35' and another terminal as the two terminals. Because in CNF, a production with two non-terminals would split into two parts.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 has a production to 't35' and NT40, which might not be helpful. Alternatively, NT36 can produce 't35'? Wait, looking for NT36:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT36 can produce 't3', 't35', 't56', etc. Wait, yes! NT36 can produce 't35' (NT36 \u2192 't35').\n\nWait, but how do I get 't35' and another terminal after it in the string?\n\nWait, the first two terminals are 't35' and '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-819","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's try to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t15 t3 t40 t4 t26 t9 t8 t22 t25 t22 t40 t9 t15 t34 t6 t4 t3 t40 t41 t32 t4 t22 t2 t40 t4 t35 t40 t34 t2 t6 t23 t32 t40 t24 t15 t10 t32 t34 t6 t31 t4 t12 t32`.\n\nFirst, I notice that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. So, the grammar consists of both terminals (like t15) and non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT89, etc.). My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nChomsky Normal Form means that the start symbol S produces two non-terminals. Looking at the first production: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, S splits into two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5. Each of these must then be expanded into a sequence of non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nI'll need to parse the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Since the grammar is context-free, I can use a recursive approach or maybe a stack-based parsing method. However, manually expanding or contracting the string step by step might be feasible given the length.\n\nLooking at the string, the first four terminals are `t15 t3 t40 t4`, which are the last few symbols in the string. Let's see where `t15` appears. Looking through the productions, I see that `t15` is the result of NT22 \u2192 't15'. So, the last part of the string ends with NT22 \u2192 t15, which is the last rule for NT22. So the end of the string corresponds to NT22.\n\nPreviously, that means the part before t15 must correspond to the other production of NT22, which is NT22 \u2192 't34'. Wait, no, looking back: the productions for NT22 are `t34` and `t9`. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, in the list, NT22 has two productions: NT22 \u2192 't34' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. Wait, no, wait, looking again, actually the productions for NT22 are:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nNo, wait, looking at the list, it's more precise to check:\n\nIn the given productions, NT22 has:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15' (from NT22 rules)\n- NT22 -> 't9' \n\nWait, I need to check the exact productions for NT22. Looking through the list, under NT22, the rules are:\n\n- NT22 -> 't34' (not sure, let me search for NT22 in the productions).\n\nLooking through the list: \n\nYes, looking specifically:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, no, actually, checking each line:\n\nLooking for NT22:\n\nYes, here's two rules for NT22:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, actually, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the list, I find:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n\nWait, actually, that's correct. So NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. So the last part of the string is 't15 t3 t40 t4', which ends with 't15'. So that must be the result of NT22 \u2192 't15', so the last part is NT22 \u2192 't15'.\n\nTherefore, the part before 't15' should correspond to the other part of NT22's production, which is 't34'. So before 't15', the string should start with 't34'. But looking at the string, before 't15', the last before that is the 't9' is not the case here. Wait, the string is ... 't22 t2 t40 t4' at the end, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should back up.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt15 t3 t40 t4 t26 t9 t8 t22 t25 t22 t40 t9 t15 t34 t6 t4 t3 t40 t41 t32 t4 t22 t2 t40 t4 t35 t40 t34 t2 t6 t23 t32 t40 t24 t15 t10 t32 t34 t6 t31 t4 t12 t32\n\nBreaking it down, the last few elements are:\n\n... t22 t2 t40 t4 t35 t40 t34 t2 t6 t23 t32 t40 t24 t15 t10 t32 t34 t6 t31 t4 t12 t32\n\nSo the final 't22 t2 t40 t4' could end in t15 or t9. Since the last before 't15' is t9, and before that is t22. So perhaps the last NT22 is producing 't15'.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should try to parse the entire string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it into the given string.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which splits into NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet me try to see what each of these might produce.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nFrom the list, NT9 can be:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT9 \u2192 NT78 NT28\n- NT9 \u2192 NT12 NT56\n- NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT55\n- NT9 \u2192 NT96 NT66\n- NT9 \u2192 NT43 NT4\n- NT9 \u2192 NT79 NT82\n- NT9 \u2192 NT43 NT96\n- NT9 \u2192 NT96 NT36\nWait, wait, no, let me look again. Each production for NT9 is:\n\nNo, perhaps I should get a list of all the grammar productions. Since this could take a while, but I need to know what NT9 can derive.\n\nFrom the list, looking for NT9:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't40' etc., but let's find NT9's rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\nLooking for NT9 in the rules:\n\nYes, I see:\n\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT90 -> NT70 NT80\n- NT29 -> NT72 NT23\n- Wait, actually, let's find NT9's rules.\n\nWait, it's easier to look for 'NT9' in the list:\n\nYes:\n\nHere's the NT9 rules:\n\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT90 -> NT70 NT80\nWait, no, perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can track back from the string. The last part is 't15', which comes from NT22. So the rest before that comes from NT22's other production, which is 't34', i.e., previous symbols should include something that produces 't34'. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string before 't15', the part is:\n\nt22 t2 t40 t4 ... leading up to t15.\n\nWait, perhaps that's too convoluted. Another approach is to represent the string as a list of tokens and try to match them against the grammar. Since each production is a binary split, perhaps I can model this with a recursive function or a stack-based parser.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map the string to see if each token corresponds to a terminal or non-terminal, and see if the entire string can be covered.\n\nBut without knowing the exact parse tree, this is challenging. However, the string is quite long, and given the time, perhaps it's better to see if any cycles or structures in the grammar would allow such a long string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals have themselves in their productions. For example, NT55 appears on the RHS of NT64 and NT27. Also, NT52 has multiple productions with itself.\n\nWait, looking at NT52's productions:\n\n- NT52 -> NT69 NT8\n- NT69 -> NT85 NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-838","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the grammar is provided, and it's in CNF, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. I remember that in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either of the type X \u2192 YZ or X \u2192 a, where Y and Z are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Each of these NTs eventually breaks down into terminals or other NTs. The string to evaluate is a series of 't's followed by numbers, which I assume are terminals. The main task is to parse this string according to the grammar.\n\nThe string is: `t34 t2 t5 t37 t34 t9 t40 t3 t40 t8 t25 t9 t15 t24 t2 t24 t25 t41 t36 t22 t3 t26 t2 t23 t5 t2 t3 t23 t34 t41 t24 t41 t23 t3 t32 t32 t35 t2 t24 t9 t3 t36 t8 t9`.\n\nSo, my approach is to model the parsing process, probably a top-down approach using the initial symbols S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and then expanding each non-terminal step by step, while keeping track of how the string elements match.\n\nI'll start by thinking of the initial non-terminals NT9 and NT5. Each of these has their own productions, which eventually lead to terminals. Let me see what each NT can produce.\n\nNT9: From the grammar, I see NT9 can produce a bunch of NTs leading to terminals. For example, NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14, and then NT14 production, etc. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT9 can go through several steps before reaching terminals.\n\nWait, I need to map out all possible derivations for NT9 and NT5, and see if their concatenation matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the string as starting with NT9 and NT5, and see if they can each generate parts of the string.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, and the NTs have their own expansion paths, this might be complex.\n\nAnother approach is to construct a parse tree that mirrors the application of the productions. Let's see: S = NT9 NT5, so the string should be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, for example:\n\nNT9 can derive things like t2, t3, etc., via a series of NTs. Similarly, NT5 can generate parts of the string, and the combination of their outputs should match the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a leftmost derivation or rightmost. Since I'm not sure of the exact structure, maybe I'll try to see how the string can be split between NT9 and NT5's outputs.\n\nBut this is going to be time-consuming. Maybe there's a pattern or structure in the string that I can spot that follows the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal in the grammar can only produce certain terminals. For example, looking at 't9', 't5', etc. So perhaps I can map each 'tX' to the possible NTs that can produce it.\n\nFor instance, looking at the grammar, I can see:\n\n- NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', and 't24'.\n- NT26 produces 't26'.\n- NT93 can produce certain sequences leading to terminals like 't34', 't2', etc.\n\nBut rather than doing this manually, perhaps I'm oversimplifying. Maybe a better approach is to write out the expansion paths step by step.\n\nWait, maybe I can write down the string and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Perhaps it's better to look for patterns. For example, each NT in the grammar leads to a certain set of terminals, so the string should have sequences that match these transitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simulate the parsing process, step by step, using a top-down approach, keeping track of the current non-terminals and their expansion.\n\nWait, another idea: since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of the string must consist of steps that split each symbol into two non-terminals before generating terminals. So the number of steps is related to the number of symbols minus one.\n\nBut not exactly, because some symbols might directly produce terminals in one step. Hmm, but perhaps the length is 58 symbols (counting the spaces as separate?), so the number of steps would be 57.\n\nBut that's not very helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can represent the string as a list and try to match the top-level productions.\n\nLet me try to think about the initial symbols S = NT9 NT5. So the string's first part is generated by NT9 and the latter part by NT5.\n\nSo, I can split the string into two parts and check if each part can be generated by NT9 and NT5 respectively.\n\nWait, that sounds manageable. So let's see: the string is `...` which is quite long, but let's take the first part from the beginning and the end.\n\nWait no, actually, the initial symbols are NT9 and NT5. So perhaps each NT starts generating from left and right ends respectively.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can check whether the string is in the language generated by S.\n\nLet me try to look at how NT9 and NT5 would expand their parts.\n\nNT9 can expand via various paths. For example, NT93 can lead to 't34' or others. Similarly, NT35 leads to 't35' and so on.\n\nWait, but this is going to take a lot of time. Maybe a more efficient approach is to see if each symbol in the string can be mapped to a production rule's terminal.\n\nBut perhaps more precisely, each symbol in the string must be a terminal that one of the NTs can derive, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a stack-based approach for the parse, where we push symbols and match them.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the smarter approach is to notice that each of the NTs can only produce a certain set of terminals. For instance, if in the given string, certain 't's don't match any of the NT productions, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's list all the possible 't's each NT can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each NT eventually terminates with some 'tX' where X is the first two digits. For example:\n\nAt the bottom of the grammar, many NTs produce terminals like:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t24\n- NT4 \u2192 t35\n- NT84 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t4\n- NT9 \u2192 t35\n- NT13 \u2192 t4 (wait, 'NT13 -> t36' no, in the grammar it's NT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66, which then go to t8 and t3 respectively. So the only terminal is 't36' and 't3' for NT13?)\n\nWait, not exactly. Looking at the bottom:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't26'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n- NT85 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't35'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22', 't26' initially? Wait, no, in the grammar NT9 can be broken into more NTs that eventually terminate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all 't's possible from each NT:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for each production that ends with a 't', we can note which NT it's associated with.\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't26'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT82 \u2192 't6'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n- NT85 \u2192 't4'\n- NT9 \u2192 't35' (from NT95 -> NT10 NT11 and then NT10 \u2192 't72', but wait, perhaps this is more involved)\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't effective. Maybe a different route is better.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the given string: t34 appears multiple times, so perhaps that's a key point. Let's see if any NT can produce 't34'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't34' comes from several NTs:\n\n- NT34 \u2192 t34 (Wait, but looking at the grammar, I don't see NT34"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-837","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) if each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal followed by two non-terminals? Wait, actually, some of the rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side, like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35 and NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Oh no, that's a problem because in CNF, each rule should produce exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, no, in CNF, B can be a single non-terminal, but if it's more than two on the right, then it's not CNF. So perhaps I need to check each production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all the productions have exactly two symbols on the right except for the terminal expansions. For example, NT22 \u2192 't24' is a terminal symbol immediately followed by another. But in CNF, a production can only have terminals followed by non-terminals, so maybe the grammar isn't strictly in CNF. Hmm, but the user presented it as a CNF grammar, so I'll proceed under that assumption, perhaps it's a mistake in the question.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is a long sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't40 t20 ... t32'. I need to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. Each 't' followed by a number is either a terminal or a symbol derived from a production. So to validate the string, I can try to parse it starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. So the first part of the string must come from NT9 and NT5. Let me see: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So the string starts with t40. Wait, in the grammar, NT72 is connected to 't34', but let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules:\nNT72 \u2192 't34'\nSo NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nThen NT72 becomes 't34', and NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22. Wait, but in the string, the first t is t40. So maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try to map each part.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to construct a parse tree step by step. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t40 t20 t31 t10 t25 t23 t15 t22 t23 t24 t36 t8 t34 t14 t31 t4 t5 t4 t5 t22 t24 t31 t22 t9 t5 t5 t5 t4 t9 t5 t5 t26 t9 t31 t34 t6 t10 t35 t40 t31 t5 t32 t40 t35\n\nWait, that's a lot of terminals. Maybe the string is too long, which might imply that some parts are repeated. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a concatenation of several smaller strings that are each generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can split the string into segments that correspond to the productions in the grammar. For example, starting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo the first part is 't40 ...' which might correspond to NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, let's look at the productions for NT9:\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nNT72 \u2192 't34'\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\n\nSo from NT9, we get 't34' followed by the expansion of NT23, which is NT93 and NT22. Let me see:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\nNT14 \u2192 't23'\nNT22 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo putting that together, NT9 produces 't34 t24'. But in the given string, the first 't40' doesn't match. So perhaps that's not the right path. Maybe S \u2192 NT52 NT89, because sometimes the string starts with certain 't's.\n\nWait, let's check the start production: S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Oh, perhaps I should consider both options, but maybe the string starts with 't40', which might come from NT52.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT52:\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nAnd NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83\nNT72 \u2192 't34'\nNT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30\nNT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\nAnd so on. It seems complex. Maybe tracing all possible paths would take too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string greedily, using a top-down approach, starting from S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet me try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\n1. S produces NT9 and NT5. So the first two parts of the string should be the expansion of NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t40. Let's see what t40 corresponds to. Scanning the productions:\n\nLooking for where 't40' is a result. For example, NT55 \u2192 't43' followed by NT46? Wait no, looking through the terminal rules. Oh, I see:\n\nNT30 \u2192 't55' NT0. Hmm, but that's more complex. Wait, let's look for where 't40' appears.\n\nWait, actually, the terminal rules are for specific expansions. Let me see: for example, NT26 \u2192 't14', NT14 \u2192 't23', etc. It's easier to create a mapping from the CNF non-terminals to the terminals. Maybe I should make a list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing down the terminals directly. Let me look at the 'terminal rules':\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT9 \u2192 't72' (Wait, no, looking back, no, the productions' terminals are as follows:\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', NT55 \u2192 't20', NT80 \u2192 't26', NT56 \u2192 't36', NT27 \u2192 't24', NT22 \u2192 't34', NT4 \u2192 't35', NT84 \u2192 't5', NT85 \u2192 't4', etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to see what each non-terminal expands into in terms of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with 't40', which would have to come from some non-terminal. So which non-terminals have 't40' in their productions?\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, let me check:\n\nNT88 \u2192 't5' \u2192 not 40.\n\nLooking for when production rules directly map to 't40':\n\nLooking at the list of terminal rules, do any non-terminals produce 't40'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 't27' (from NT36 \u2192 NT55 NT0; no, because NT55 is 't20' and NT0 is another non-terminal leading to 't70' etc.), not t40.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Wait, NT84 \u2192 't5', but after that, NT28 is NT24, which is 't10':\n\nWait no, looking at the rules again, I see that NT23 \u2192 't9', which is a terminal, but I'm looking for t40 specifically. Hmm, perhaps I should make a list of all terminal rules as per the given grammar.\n\nWait, compiling a map from non-terminals that directly expand into terminals:\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT55 \u2192 t20\n- NT80 \u2192 t26\n- NT56 \u2192 t36\n- NT36 \u2192 t41 (Wait, no: NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43, but I think I misread earlier. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT36 appears in several productions. Specifically, looking at the given grammar:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT15 NT69\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43 (again)\n- Wait, looking at the grammar, each production that has NT36 on the left leads to specific combinations.

{"custom_id":"request-857","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and a specific string that I need to determine if it's generated by this grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The given grammar seems to have several non-terminals (S, NT52, NT89, etc.) and terminals (t20, t21, etc.) as per the productions.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t20 t20 t2 t37 t14 t20 t8 t20 t4 t12 t36 t12 t2 t41 t25 t2 t32 t14 t4 t2 t24 t3 t3 t40 t41 t31 t23 t9 t20 t20 t34 t35 t14 t23 t41 t9 t20 t8 t6 t40 t32 t25 t32 t23 t3`.\n\nMy initial thought is that this string consists of a sequence of terminals, and the grammar's non-terminals need to be converted into these terminals through production rules. So, each non-terminal in the grammar should eventually be expanded into a sequence of terminals. \n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This means that the entire string should be built by replacing non-terminals step by step until only terminals are left.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that some non-terminals are replaced with two terminals, so I'll check if each part of the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules.\n\nFor example, starting from 't20 t20 ...', I'll check if 't20' corresponds to any production rule. Looking at the given rules, I see that NT10 \u2192 't26', and other rules like NT26 \u2192 't73', but 't20' appears in multiple NT25 \u2192 't25', NT55 \u2192 't20', and so on. Wait, from the provided rules, I notice that NT25 \u2192 't25', which might imply that 't25' is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Similarly, 't20' is present as a result of NT55 \u2192 't20', so 't20' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first few tokens are t20, t20. Let me check the grammar. In the rules, NT10 \u2192 't26', NT55 \u2192 't20', NT25 \u2192 't25', and so on. So 't20' is a terminal. So in the production, we can directly go to 't20', which is a terminal.\n\nNext, looking at the string: t20 t20 t2 t37... etc. So, I'll have to see if the earlier non-terminals can lead to these terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, which simplifies parsing, possibly using something like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can try to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nAnother idea is to note that in CNF, each production splits into two parts, so the string can be broken down in a certain way. For example, the string's length should allow for a derivation that follows the grammar's rules.\n\nHowever, manually parsing this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if each substring of terminals can be matched by the grammar rules.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me check if each part of the string can be generated by looking at the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nLet me list the terminals present in the string:\n\nLooking at the string, the t's are t20, t21, t2, t37, etc. Wait, in the given grammar, some terminals are things like t2, t3, t20, etc. Let me check which ones are present:\n\nLooking through the given grammar rules, the RHS of the productions have various terminals:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT10 \u2192 't26' \u2192 't26' is a terminal.\n\nNT55 \u2192 't20' \u2192 't20' is a terminal.\n\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\nNT95 \u2192 't79', 't89'\n\nWait, but in the string, I see terms like t20, t2, t37, t14, t8, etc. So, for example, 't20' corresponds to NT55, and 't14' is in NT14 \u2192 't23' wait no, in the grammar, looking back:\n\nLooking at the rules, each terminal is a specific string. For instance:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT8 \u2192 't73' and 't2'\n- NT13 \u2192 't36' and 't66'\n\nBut in the string, I have terms like t2, t37, t14, etc. Wait, looking through the rules, let's see which terminals are defined.\n\nHere's a list of terminal productions from the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34' \u2192 So 't15', 't9', 't34' are terminals.\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' \u2192 't25' is terminal.\n- NT4 \u2192 't35' \u2192 't35' terminal.\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' \u2192 same as above.\n- NT8 \u2192 't73', 't2' \u2192 So 't73' and 't2' are terminals.\n- NT13 \u2192 't36', 't66' \u2192 't36' and 't66' are terminals.\n- NT66 \u2192 't3' \u2192 't3' terminal.\n- NT27 \u2192 't32' \u2192 't32' terminal.\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34' \u2192 same as above.\n- NT55 \u2192 't20' \u2192 't20' terminal.\n- NT10 \u2192 't26' \u2192 't26' terminal.\n- NT56 \u2192 't36', 't95' \u2192 't36' and 't95' are terminals.\n- NT22 \u2192 't34' \u2192 added.\n- NT22 \u2192 't9' \u2192 added.\n- NT4 \u2192 't35' \u2192 same.\n- NT2 \u2192 't6' \u2192 't6' terminal.\n- NT84 \u2192 t5, etc. But actually, these are non-terminals because the RHS is NT28 and NT89, which are non-terminals.\n\nWait, but the string has t37, which isn't listed in the terminal productions above. Hmm, that's a problem because if the grammar doesn't produce t37 as a terminal, then the string should be invalid.\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces t37 as a terminal. All the terminals are things like t2, t3, t5, t6, t9, etc., but no t37. So 't37' would not be allowed as a terminal in the grammar, meaning the string can't be generated by the given grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check the grammar rules to confirm if I missed any t37.\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 NT82 and NT52, which are non-terminals.\n- NT40 \u2192 't23', 't9', etc., but 't40' isn't a terminal; it's part of non-terminals.\n- Checking the RHS of all productions: Only some terminals appear. So yeah, t37 isn't listed anywhere as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string contains a terminal that the grammar can't produce, which means the string is not part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nSo without even needing to parse the entire string further, I can conclude that the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. This makes parsing manageable, especially with algorithms like CYK.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n\n`t31 t2 t2 t3 t6 t14 t35 t15 t10 t3 t8 t32 t4 t8 t26 t37 t40 t35 t34 t25 t26 t12 t36 t5 t32 t41 t40 t25 t26 t23 t40 t31 t14 t12 t12 t15 t34 t2 t23 t4 t26 t22 t6 t5 t41`\n\nI notice that the string consists of terminals (t followed by numbers). My job is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT9 NT5. Each non-terminal can produce other non-terminals or, in some cases, terminals. So, I'll need to trace a path from S down to the given string.\n\nI'll start by identifying which non-terminals can directly produce the first terminal, t31. Let's look through the productions for the non-terminals that can produce t31. Scanning the rules:\n\n- NT9 can produce t31. The production for NT9 is: NT95 -> NT10 NT11, which is a bit complex, but looking at the last part, NT9 can eventually produce 't31' as per the rule NT9 -> t31.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT10 is 't26', NT11 is 't41'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing a direct production. Alternatively, looking through all the rules, I find NT22 -> 't34' but nothing directly for t31. Wait, maybe I need to look in the detailed productions:\n\nLooking through the detailed productions, for terminals:\n\n- NT22 -> 't34'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT73 -> 't34'\n- NT87 -> 't31'?\nWait, no, in the detailed list, I see NT87 -> 't36' and 't31'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the detailed productions:\n\nNT13 -> 't31' yes, that's one production. So NT13 can produce 't31'. So, the first step is:\n\nT31 can come from NT13.\n\nNow, how do we get to NT13? Let's trace back. We need to see how NT13 is derived.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT13 is derived from other non-terminals. The productions for NT13 are:\n\nNT13 -> ... (looking through the list) I don't see a production for NT13 that directly produces other symbols. Wait, in the grammar, let me check:\n\nWait, in the detailed productions, I see:\n\nNT13: NT35 -> NT15 NT69, NT66 -> NT3, NT22 -> t34, etc. Wait, in the full list, I don't see NT13 being a parent of other non-terminals. Instead, NT13 is 't31', so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nThe non-terminals are like S, NT9, NT5, etc., and the terminals are t followed by numbers.\n\nSo, in the grammar, for example, NT22 -> 't34'. So, NT22 can produce the terminal 't34'. Similarly, NT13 can produce 't31'.\n\nSo, in the string, the first terminal is t31, which must come from a non-terminal that can produce t31. From the grammar, NT13 can produce t31, so the first step is to have NT13 in the derivation.\n\nNow, how do we get to NT13? Looking for a production that leads to NT13. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT23 -> NT93 NT22, and NT22 can produce t34. But that might not be relevant here.\n\nWait, I'm looking for a production where NT13 is on the left side. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT13: I don't see a production where NT13 is produced by other non-terminals. It seems NT13 is a terminal because it has t31, right? Because in the detailed list, I see NT13 -> 't31'.\n\nSo, NT13 is a terminal. Then, in the string, the first t31 must be produced by NT13. So, in the derivation, we must have a path to NT13 that ends with t31.\n\nBut wait, let's check how NT13 is derived. Since NT13 is a terminal, it doesn't have a production in the grammar; it's only a terminal symbol. So, its only way to be derived is directly from a rule that ends with itself.\n\nSo, if the derivation requires that S produces NT9 NT5, and then somehow these non-terminals produce the terminals in the string, including t31 via NT13.\n\nThis makes me think that the string must have a t31 which is a result of NT13, and NT13 must be part of the derivation. But since NT13 is a terminal, it doesn't produce any further.\n\nSo, the question is: Can the grammar derive a string that includes t31 as a terminal?\n\nLooking at the string, t31 appears early on, so I need to see if the grammar can produce t31 in a valid derivation.\n\nWait, but looking through the detailed productions, I see that NT13 -> 't31' is a terminal, so yes, the grammar can produce t31.\n\nBut is there a way to reach NT13 in the derivation? Because NT13 is a terminal, it means that in the top-level derivation, a non-terminal must produce NT13, which is only possible if a production rule for a non-terminal includes NT13 on the left side, but as a terminal, it can't derive further.\n\nWait, but all non-terminals in the grammar have productions that either produce a single non-terminal or two non-terminals. So, no non-terminal directly produces a terminal besides via those rules.\n\nWait, the grammar as given in the initial list has productions like NT22 -> 't34', which means NT22 is a non-terminal that can produce the terminal 't34'.\n\nSo, if I'm trying to derive t31, I need a production chain that starts from S and ends with t31.\n\nLooking at the production rules, the only way to get t31 is via NT13 -> 't31'.\n\nSo, the derivation would have to be such that at some point, a rule leads to NT13, which then directly produces 't31'.\n\nBut how do you get to NT13? Since NT13 is a terminal, you can't derive it from other non-terminals because you only have a production that leads to it as a terminal.\n\nWait, unless NT13 is a non-terminal in a production chain leading to it, but looking at the detailed rules:\n\nI don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces NT13, only that NT13 is a terminal that can be derived from somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify:\n\nIn CFGs, a terminal is a symbol that cannot be further expanded. So, if the grammar doesn't have a production for NT13 -> something else, then it can't be derived within the grammar. Only the string would contain the terminal NT13, but if NT13 is a terminal, it must appear as such.\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, I don't see any production where NT13 is on the left side. It only appears on the right side in the detailed productions as a terminal.\n\nSo, that means NT13 is part of the terminals, not non-terminals. Therefore, in the string, the terminal 't31' is represented by NT13.\n\nBut then, how can the grammar derive 't31'? Because NT13 is a terminal, so the only way to produce 't31' is if it's directly produced by a non-terminal that doesn't have any further productions.\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, NT13 is a terminal, so it can't be derived; it's just a terminal symbol. That suggests that the grammar can only produce terms where NT13 is part of the string, but since it's a terminal, it's in the string as is.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the symbols in the grammar and the terminals in the string.

First, I should understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The productions go from S to NT9 NT5, which suggests that each step of the derivation involves combining two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t25 t5 t36 t37 t41 t23 t32 t25 t25 t6 t40 t37 t24 t12 t40 t24 t26 t34 t40 t41 t9 t5 t40 t23 t26 t31 t5 t5 t12 t8 t31 t35 t9 t25 t4 t37 t8 t10 t8 t23 t35 t26 t37 t36 t8 t6.\n\nThe goal is to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. I think the best approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it might be easier to use a recursive descent parser or maybe a leftmost derivation. However, since the string is quite long, I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step would produce 't9' and 't5' somewhere in the string. Looking through the string, the first part is 't25', which doesn't match 't9' or 't5'. That might be an issue, but perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, wait, maybe I got the productions wrong.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the productions for NT9, NT5, etc., are rules that eventually resolve to terminals. So I need to check what each non-terminal expands into. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT79 NT89 | NT82 NT27 | ... | 't24'. Similarly, NT10 \u2192 various non-terminals and eventually 't26'.\n\nWait, no, I should look at each production rule.

Starting from the first symbol 't25', but looking at the grammar, I see that NT25 has production NT42 and NT26, which in turn are non-terminals. Wait, no: NT25 \u2192 NT42 and NT26. Then NT42 \u2192 nt24 is one option, but looking at the rules, NT42 has production NT12 NT56 and others. But wait, in the rules, NT42 is listed as NT12 NT56 and some others, including NT27 NT34, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the entire string step by step. Since the first part is 't25', perhaps that comes from NT25. But looking at the grammar, I don't see a production for NT25 except as NT42 or NT25 \u2192 ...

So the first symbols should be from NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't25', which is the start of NT25's expansion. So for NT9 to produce 't9' and for NT5 to produce 't5', or perhaps they produce other combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list each production rule and see what terminals they expand to. For example, NT9's productions are:\n\nNT93: various combinations down to terminals, including 't40', 't24', etc. But I don't see a direct 't9' in NT9's productions. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT91 \u2192 NT27 NT95, which goes to 't4' and 't40' perhaps.\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't40' and 't10'\n\nWait, but the terminal 't25' is only present in NT25's production. So if the first symbol is 't25', perhaps that comes from NT25. But S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S's first production is NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols of the string should be the first symbols generated by NT9 and NT5.\n\nBut the first symbol is 't25', which is not a terminal from NT9 or NT5. Wait, maybe that's impossible. Let's double-check: the string starts with 't25', which isn't an option for the start symbol.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking at the productions. Let me scan through the grammar to see what terminals exist.\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules, I see that terminals have 't' followed by a number, like 't25', 't5', etc.\n\nLooking for the entire string: 't25 t5 t36 t37 t41 t23 t32 t25 t25 t6 t40 t37 t24 t12 t40 t24 t26 t34 t40 t41 t9 t5 t40 t23 t26 t31 t5 t5 t12 t8 t31 t35 t9 t25 t4 t37 t8 t10 t8 t23 t35 t26 t37 t36 t8 t6'.\n\nSo it's a sequence of t25, t5, etc.\n\nSo the first symbol is 't25'. Let me see if any non-terminals expand to 't25'. Looking through the grammar, I see in NT25 \u2192 't25' (this is production number 32). So NT25 is the only non-terminal that produces 't25'.\n\nNow, looking at S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which would generate two symbols: the first from NT9 and the second from NT5. But 't25' is the first symbol of the string, so it must come from the first non-terminal in this production, which is NT9. So, the first symbol 't25' must come from NT9.\n\nBut in the grammar, does any production of NT9 result in 't25' as the first symbol?\n\nLooking back at NT9's rules:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 | ... and others, but do any of these produce 't25'? Looking at NT16: NT16 \u2192 't37' as one option. So, if NT9 is producing NT16, then that would give 't37' as part of the string. But the first symbol is 't25', which isn't 't37'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Or perhaps the string is a mix of non-terminals and terminals, but in the problem statement, the string is given as a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, meaning that all the symbols are terminals. So actually, the string is a sequence of terminals only, so S must directly derive to a sequence of terminals without non-terminals.\n\nBut according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which are non-terminals, so S directly can't produce a terminal string. Therefore, the string must be derived through multiple steps of non-terminals expanding into more non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut according to the given grammar, the start symbol S branches into NT9 and NT5, and each of those branches further down into more non-terminals and eventually terminals. So the entire string must be produced by expanding S into a sequence of non-terminals, which in turn produce the terminals.\n\nHowever, the first symbol in the string is 't25', which comes from NT25. So in the expansion of NT9, it must somehow produce 't25' at some point. Let me check what NT9 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT9's rules:\n\nNT93 \u2192 ... includes NT16 and others, but I don't see a direct path from NT9 to 't25'. NT36's rules, for example, can produce 't41' or others, but 't25' isn't among them.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at NT25 production, which directly gives 't25'.

{"custom_id":"request-872","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is: \n\n`t24 t8 t26 t4 t12 t23 t31 t5 t37 t20 t23 t15 t15 t23 t41 t32 t26 t22 t2 t9 t35 t9 t20 t15 t26 t35 t25 t37 t23 t8 t22 t35 t4 t15 t32 t32 t9 t40 t25 t24 t31 t22 t34 t32 t10 t23`.\n\nFirst, let me recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is particularly useful for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but since I'm not using that here, I'll approach it differently.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, every production starts with a capital letter and leads to two non-terminals (except for the ones that directly translate into terminals, I think). The terminals here are strings like 't24', 't8', etc., which are individual tokens, and the non-terminals are letters like S, N, T, etc.\n\nSo, my task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using productions until I reach all the terminals.\n\nFirst step: Let me note that the grammar is given in expansion form. Each production on the left is expanded into two parts on the right, and each part can either be a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nHowever, looking at the grammar, I notice some terminals like 't24' directly appear in the productions. For example, NT64 \u2192 't15' or NT8 \u2192 't2', etc. So these terminals are the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I should see if the derivation tree for this string can be formed using the given productions.\n\nBut wait, going through each step manually for such a long string might be time-consuming, so perhaps I can look for patterns or simplifying strategies.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string using the given grammar. However, without a specific parsing table or algorithm, that might be difficult. So perhaps a better approach is to check if the given string can be broken down into parts that match the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nEach production on the left (before the arrow) has exactly two non-terminals. So, the entire string must be a sequence of such productions, each contributing exactly two non-terminals on the left, which in turn resolve further until all are terminals.\n\nBut how do I map the string to the grammar? Let me think.\n\nPerhaps the first step is to check the structure of the string. The string starts with 't24', which comes from NT64 \u2192 't15' and NT16 \u2192... Wait, looking back, let me check each production.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT15 NT22\n- NT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60\n- NT27 \u2192 't24'\n\nSo, NT64 can produce a derivation path that leads to 't24' eventually.\n\nSimilarly, other parts of the string may come from specific non-terminals. So, I need to find a way to break down the string into these components.\n\nLet me attempt to break down the string into the possible productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt24 t8 t26 t4 t12 t23 t31 t5 t37 t20 t23 t15 t15 t23 t41 t32 t26 t22 t2 t9 t35 t9 t20 t15 t26 t35 t25 t37 t23 t8 t22 t35 t4 t15 t32 t32 t9 t40 t25 t24 t31 t22 t34 t32 t10 t23.\n\nI notice that the string is a series of 't's followed by numbers, which are the terminals from the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar uses CNF, and that each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, I can only have a string where the number of symbols is (2^n - 1) where n is the number of productions applied. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nIn a typical CFG, a string of length L can have derivations based on how non-terminals are expanded. Since this grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals. Therefore, the total number of symbols can grow by 1 each time a non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: Starting from S, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, each production replaces one symbol into two, so the length increases by 1 each time a symbol is replaced. Thus, starting from S (1 symbol), each step increases the number of symbols by 1.\n\nSo, the total number of symbols in the final string should be (n + 1), where n is the number of productions used.\n\nWait, let me calculate the number of symbols in the string.\n\nLooking at the string: Let me count the number of tokens.\n\nCounting the spaces: it's separated by spaces, so I can just count the parts: The string is 55 tokens long (I counted them by splitting on spaces; each 't' and number is a token).\n\nSo, length is 55. Therefore, the number of productions should be 54, because each production increases the count by 1.\n\nBut I don't know the exact number of non-terminals, but it's 55, which is acceptable because it's generated via 54 productions.\n\nBut anyway, that's just a check for possible derivation, but the main issue is to see if it can be generated from the grammar.\n\nNow, perhaps another approach is to see if the string can be divided into chunks that match the grammar productions.\n\nLet me start by looking for the first production that starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, let's see: S is NT9 followed by NT5, as per the given grammar.\n\nSo, initially, the string should start with two non-terminals, which then get expanded. But in our case, the string starts with 't24', which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. Therefore, the initial expansion of S must be such that one of the two symbols becomes a terminal, and the other continues to be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nThen, each NT9 and NT5 would have their own productions. So perhaps I can see how 't24' comes from NT64, and see if that can be matched with part of the string.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look at the entire string and see if it can be split into a series of production steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start from the top and see if the string can be generated by S.\n\nStarting with S, which expands to NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet me see what possible expansions NT9 and NT5 can have.\n\nLooking at NT9:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nSo NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Then, each of those could expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 is followed by NT8, maybe.\n\nWait, NT5 \u2192 according to the grammar, is not a production, but wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking at NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16. So NT65 may be a typo, but actually, looking back, in the productions listed in the user message, I think the user might have listed a lot of NTX productions.\n\nWait, let me make sure I can parse the production information correctly.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, the productions start as:\n\nS -> NT9 NT95 NT5 \u2013 Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the given grammar, the left-hand side of the productions is on the left, and the right-hand sides are on the right. Wait, wait, in the initial message, the user wrote the grammar as:\n\nS -> NT99 NT52\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I misread earlier.

Now, looking at the grammar, which nonterminal can produce t14? It seems that none of the rules directly do. Wait, no. Looking back, maybe I missed a production for NT22.\n\nWait, looking again at the grammar:\n\nNT22 is defined as:\n\nNT22 -> 't24' \n\nSo how do I get t14? Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misread. Let me look for 't14' in the list of terminal productions. Scanning all the terminal productions:\n\nDo any NTs produce 't14'? Looking at the provided rules, I don't see any. So, t14 is a terminal that isn't directly produced by any nonterminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because all terminals must be covered by the productions. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the rules again more carefully.\n\nLooking through each rule:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24', 't15', 't9' \u2192 so produces t24, t15, t9, etc., but not t14.\n\nWait, so in the string, the first symbol is t14. But the grammar doesn't have any nonterminal that can produce t14. So that would mean the string is invalid, thus the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me go through each rule.\n\nLooking at the rules provided:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't24', 't15', 't9'\n\nIs there any NT that produces t14? Let me check.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\nNT22: 't24', 't15', 't9'\n\nNT22: Wait, no other NTs seem to produce t14 based on the rules provided. Therefore, t14 can't be produced by any nonterminal, which means the string can't be generated by the grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string to evaluate is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which look like terminal symbols. The grammar has several productions, and some of them directly lead to terminals, like NT22 \u2192 't15', and so on.\n\nFirst, I should parse the string into its individual symbols. The string is: \n\nt41 t22 t41 t24 t9 t41 t10 t14 t23 t2 t40 t8 t24 t5 t23 t36 t35 t37 t22 t35 t9 t25 t8 t37 t40 t23 t32 t20 t25 t25 t14 t9 t3 t31 t31 t5 t6 t5 t6 t22 t31 t12 t20 t31 t9 t5 t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals correspond to certain non-terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 t4, but wait, in the grammar rules, I see NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which eventually leads to t4 and t26, right? Hmm, maybe I need to look at the bottom of the grammar.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there are productions where NT... becomes 't...'. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT25 \u2192 't36', etc. So I need to trace each terminal in the string back to non-terminals until I can find the derivation.\n\nBut wait, the provided grammar only has a few rules leading to terminals. For example:\n\nChecking the production rules, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT80 \u2192 't26'\nNT56 \u2192 't36'\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\nNT25 \u2192 't36' (Wait, NT25 \u2192 t36?

Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't36'\nNT25 \u2192 't36'\n\nSimilarly, NT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nSo for example, NT22 becomes t15, NT25 becomes t36, etc.\n\nBut the problem is that not all NT rules directly go to terminals; many go to other non-terminals, which in turn go to other non-terminals or eventually to terminals.\n\nBut given that the provided string consists entirely of terminals, we need to find a way to derive the entire string from the start symbol S.\n\nSince the string is quite long, maybe I can start by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire string is a concatenation of terminals, so each token represents a terminal symbol. Therefore, each token must be derived from a non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nSo, the first token is 't41'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't41'?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT0 NT9\nBut then NT0's productions don't seem to lead to 't41'. Alternatively, looking at the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT production where a rule ends in 't41':\n\nLooking through the rules, here's one: NT36 \u2192 't41'. Yes, in the grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43, and then NT27 \u2192 't41'. So NT36 can derive to 't41' via NT27.\n\nWait, no.

So, from NT27, we get 't25'. Then NT43 is another non-terminal, which leads to NT86 and NT27.\n\nWait, this might be a chain. Let me see.\n\nWait, the production for NT36 is NT27 NT43, which then NT27 \u2192 t25 and NT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27. So NT36 \u2192 t25 NT43.\n\nBut NT43 can produce more:\n\nNT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27\nNT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27\nNT27 \u2192 t25\nSo NT86 can produce NT83 and t25.\n\nBut this seems like an infinite loop.

{"custom_id":"request-911","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the problem. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a terminal. So, looking at the grammar provided, most of the rules are like S -> NT1 NT2, which fits CNF.\n\nThe string to evaluate is long and consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't9', 't20', etc. My first thought is to see if each of these terminals corresponds to some rule in the grammar. For example, rules like NT0 -> 't70' or NT0 -> 't80' are present, so 't70' and 't80' are terminals. But other terminals like 't9', 't20', etc., also seem to be part of the string.\n\nI need to create a parse tree from the string, using the grammar rules. Each node in the tree should be a non-terminal, except the leaves, which should be terminals, matching the string.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few tokens in the string: 't9', 't20', 't34', 't34', 't2', 't23', 't23', 't14', 't5', 't26', 't40', 't31', 't8', etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see:\n- NT9 -> 't23' (among others)\nWait, actually, I need to check all the rules where the left-hand side starts with 't' or the right-hand side leads to a 't'.\n\nFor example:\n- RT66 -> 't3'\n- RT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- RT4 -> 't35'\n- RT5 -> 't22'\n- RT8 -> 't2'\n- RT16 -> 't37'\n- RT14 -> 't23', 't8'\n- RT28 -> 't10'\n- RT39 -> 't22', 't8'\n- RT73 -> 't34'\n- RT87 -> 't36'\n- RT51 -> 't20' (Wait, no, RT51 might not, but looking at NT51's production: NT51 -> NT27 NT95, and further down, NT27 -> 't15' and NT95 -> 't10' or other things. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for production rules where the right-hand side includes terminals that match the first few tokens in the string. For instance, the first token is 't9'. Looking at the grammar, which rule produces 't9'? Scanning through, I see rules like RT66 -> 't3', RT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34', RT4 -> 't35', RT5 -> 't22', etc. I don't immediately see a rule that produces 't9' as a terminal. Wait, maybe I missed some.\n\nWait, looking again, under RT6: NT65 is mentioned, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong parts. Alternatively, perhaps some non-terminals can derive to 't9' via other production rules. Alternatively, maybe the string contains a 't9' that doesn't have a corresponding production. That might be a problem.\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'. So if NT22 is on the left side, it can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. So, if our string has 't9', that would come from NT22 -> 't9'.\n\nSimilarly, the string starts with 't9', which would require that either the top-level non-terminal S generates NT9, which then splits into two non-terminals. Wait, S's production is S -> NT9 NT5. So S splits into NT9 and NT5. Each of these would then need to derive into the required terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this by trying to build the parse tree step by step. Let's try to parse the string starting from the beginning.\n\nThe string starts with 't9'. Let's see where 't9' can come from. Looking at the grammar, the only place I see 't9' is in NT22's production: NT22 -> 't15' | 't9' | 't34'. So 't9' can come from NT22.\n\nSo, to have 't9' in the string, either S must produce NT22 at some point, or some other non-terminal that can derive to NT22.\n\nWait, S's production is S -> NT9 NT5. So S starts by splitting into NT9 and NT5. Let's see what NT9 and NT5 can derive.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions: NT95 -> 't10' | 't11', NT93 -> 't23' | 't42', NT79 -> 't2' | 't16', etc. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's list out the production rules for NT9:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT82 | NT15 NT95 | NT13 NT75?\nWait, no, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at the first few lines:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\nNT79 -> NT2 NT16\nWait, no, actually, the NT9's productions are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\n\nNT79 -> NT2 NT16\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting lost in the rules. Let's make a list of all NTx productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to start from the top and see how each non-terminal can produce certain terminals.\n\nGiven that, starting with S -> NT9 NT5, each of these must derive a part of the string.\n\nThe string starts with 't9', so either NT9 or NT5 must start with a production that leads to 't9'.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nWait, let's see which NT9's rules produce a terminal. Looking through NT9's rules:\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\nNT79 -> NT2 NT16\nWait, I don't see any NT9 rules that directly produce 't9'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string starts with 't9', which would mean that NT9 must somehow derive to a string starting with 't9'. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the rules where the left-hand side is NT22, since in the string, 't9' is the first token. Wait, no, 't9' is in the string as the first token, but NT22 isn't directly part of the S's production. So perhaps the parse tree isn't starting from S, but that's impossible because the start symbol is S.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me check S's production again: S -> NT9 NT52. Hmm, no, looking back:\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as:\n\n```S -> NT9 NT5\nNT52 -> NT89 NT35\n...```\n\nWait, no, I need to be precise.

For example, NT52 -> NT89 NT35, and so on. So each derivation step breaks down into two parts until we hit the terminal symbols.

{"custom_id":"request-937","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a given context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a series of \"t\" followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols. The grammar has a bunch of production rules that define how the non-terminal symbols can expand into other symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have production rules of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So all the productions here should fit that structure. Looking through the provided grammar, it seems to be correctly in CNF because each production either expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: \n`t9 t40 t31 t23 t34 t14 t4 t24 t12 t8 t15 t25 t24 t22 t25 t15 t8 t3 t35 t26 t25 t20 t35 t32 t40 t5 t8 t20 t14 t40 t41 t25 t8 t24 t9 t8 t23 t10 t4 t35 t40 t8 t8 t6 t24 t34 t24 t14`\n\nMy task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions. \n\nSince this is a CFG in CNF, the derivation process would involve a series of productions where each non-terminal is expanded into two non-terminals, and this process continues recursively until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals, resulting in the target string.\n\nOne approach here is to work backwards from the string, trying to see if it can be built up by matching the productions. This technique is called the \"top-down\" parsing or, more accurately, generating the string from the grammar. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach can be used, starting from the string and trying to reduce it to the start symbol.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, the approach should be systematic. I think I'll try a top-down approach because it's often more straightforward when you have the starting symbol and its productions. However, since the string is given, perhaps a bottom-up method might be more feasible, especially since the productions can be checked to see if they match sections of the string.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the length of the string. Each production in CNF either produces one terminal or two non-terminals. Therefore, every production step either adds one terminal (if it's a terminal production) or increases the length by one (if it's a non-terminal production followed by two non-terminals, but each can be either terminal or non-terminal).\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is either A \u2192 a terminal or A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. So, if we start with S and keep expanding non-terminals, each step either reduces the number of non-terminals (by replacing one with two) or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal, thus reducing the number of non-terminals by one.\n\nBut considering the string, it's a series of terminals, so we need to have a sequence that can be generated by expanding non-terminals step by step until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is 52 symbols long, and considering that each expansion of a non-terminal (if it's a terminal) adds one to the length, if it's a non-terminal that expands into two non-terminals, the length would increase by one each time that non-terminal is expanded.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. Starting from S, which is a single non-terminal, each production step involving a non-terminal that produces two non-terminals increases the count of non-terminals by one. Terminal productions reduce the count by one.\n\nBut in this case, the string has no non-terminals, only terminals. So starting from S, we need to perform a sequence of productions until all non-terminals are replaced, and the result is the string.\n\nGiven that the string is 52 symbols long, which is quite long, I wonder if it's manageable to try to find a sequence of expansions or perhaps to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production's right-hand side is either a terminal or a combination of two non-terminals. Therefore, any production that contributes a terminal to the string must be a terminal production. Non-terminal productions will contribute two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, given the target string is a list of terminals, we can attempt to break it down into components that match the productions.\n\nPerhaps a recursive approach would help, trying to split the string into segments that match the productions. Since the string is a sequence of \"t\" followed by numbers, I think each part might correspond to a production.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the derivation process, we can try to see if the string can be built from the start symbol S by replacing S with NT9 NT5 (since S \u2192 NT9 NT5), then replacing NT9 and NT5 as needed until we get down to terminals.\n\nBut manually expanding S would be tedious, especially for a string of 52 symbols. Instead, perhaps I can identify parts of the string that correspond to known productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT5 \u2192 t35\n- NT8 \u2192 t2\n- NT13 \u2192 t31\n- NT14 \u2192 t23\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\n- NT24 \u2192 t9, t12, t25, t34, t24\n- NT28 \u2192 t10, t8, t5, t9, t27\n- NT35 \u2192 t15, t56, etc.\n- And so on.\n\nLooking at the string, I can start by checking if any of the terminals (t9, t40, etc.) directly correspond to a terminal production.\n\nWait, no. The string is just a sequence of \"tX\" where X is a number, but in the grammar, the terminals are actually the \"t\" followed by numbers as per the grammar rules. For example, in the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t25, which means that when NT6 is derived, it becomes \"t25\". So in the string, each \"t9\" corresponds to NT9 being expanded and resulting in that terminal.\n\nSo, the plan is to see if the given string can be broken down into a sequence of productions that generate each part.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I might look for matches to the right-hand sides of the productions. Since the string is long, this might take a while, but I can try to split it into manageable parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be reduced by matching terminal parts and seeing if the remaining string can be generated by the non-terminals.\n\nI think a better approach is to parse the string from left to right, using the productions to replace non-terminals with their corresponding terminals or pairs of non-terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, I might need to identify sections of the string that match specific productions.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is given, I can check if it can be built up by applying the productions in order.\n\nWait, perhaps to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar, I can attempt to break down the string into components matching the productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the string: t9.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 can produce several things:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT9 \u2192 NT22 NT8\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n- NT9 \u2192 NT4 NT35\n\nNone of these directly produce t9 as a terminal, but wait, looking further, perhaps terminal symbols are more evident in the grammar.\n\nWait, for example, NT2 \u2192 t6, so when NT2 is derived, it becomes \"t6\". Similarly, NT10 \u2192 t26, NT15 \u2192 t4, etc.\n\nLooking back, the target string starts with t9, t40, t31, etc. So, perhaps t9 is generated by some non-terminal NT that produces t9 as a terminal? Looking at the grammar, it seems that in some cases, NT's can directly produce a terminal when a production's right-hand side includes that terminal.\n\nWait, for example, looking at:\n\nNT42 \u2192 t12 t56\nBut t12 might come from NT12 or something else, I'm not sure. Maybe I should check each production to see if it directly includes a \"t\" symbol as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nOh, I see that some productions have terminals on the right-hand side. For example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t3\nNT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\nNT35 \u2192 t15, t56, etc.\nBut looking for direct terminals:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is pretty complex with many productions, and the string is quite long. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the productions fit this form, so that's good.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. I notice that some of these 't' parts are like 't32', 't24', and so on.

Alternatively, I can try expanding S to see if it can generate this string, possibly through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, its initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. That means S is directly replaced by NT9 and NT5. So, the first step is to consider NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet me check what rules exist for NT9 and NT5. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT9: The rules include NT9 \u2192 NT84 NT5 \u2192 which eventually leads to other non-terminals. Wait, but from the given grammar, I see that NT93 is produced by several rules, but that's not directly helpful here. Let me look for NT9 specifically.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 is not directly defined. Instead, it's involved in several rules leading to other non-terminals. So, perhaps I need to see how NT9 can be expanded. From the grammar, I see that NT95 and NT93 are expanded, but NT9 itself is used in NT95 and NT93.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me make a list of NT9's rules.\n\nFrom the productions, the grammar has:\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nAnd\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 from looking up \"NT9\". Wait, is that right? Let me check the list:\n\nLooking through the productions, I find:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 NT25 NT8.\n- NT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66.\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11.\n\nWait, no, NT9 is in the grammar.

So after the first step, the string would start with NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, each of these non-terminals (NT9 and NT5) will themselves be expanded into more non-terminals and eventually terminals.\n\nI need to see if the given string starts with any of these initial productions.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the first few tokens. The first token is t32, which is a terminal. I need to find which non-terminal it's linked to.\n\nLooking at all the 't...' patterns in the grammar, here's a summary:\n\n- t32: is that a terminal? I see in the grammar rules, there's `t32` as an expansion of NT6 or NT36. Let me check:\n\nYes, under NT36, there's a production: NT36 \u2192 t41 NT15, and also NT36 \u2192 t35 NT56, etc. But specifically, I see that in the grammar, `t32 NT24` comes from NT6. Because in the grammar, under NT6, there's `t25 NT16`. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar list, I find:\n\n- `NT66 -> t3 NT22`\n- `NT22 -> t34`\n- `NT6 -> t25 NT16`\n- Wait, actually, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rules that replace non-terminals with terminals plus non-terminals:\n\nFirst, scan the grammar:\n\nLooking for lines where non-terminals are on the left, then after a \u2192, they have some terminal and other non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 t3 NT22\nNT22 \u2192 t34\nNT22 \u2192 t15\nNT22 \u2192 t9\nNT55 \u2192 t20\nNT80 \u2192 t26\nNT56 \u2192 t36\nNT10 \u2192 t26\nNT72 \u2192 t35\nNT78 \u2192 t40\nNT6 \u2192 t25\nNT15 \u2192 t4\nNT2 \u2192 t6\nNT66 \u2192 t3\nNT22 \u2192 t34\nNT4 \u2192 t35\nNT84 \u2192 t5\nNT85 \u2192 t4\nNT28 \u2192 t15\nNT66 \u2192 t4\nNT60 \u2192 t12\nNT36 \u2192 t41\nNT56 \u2192 t37\nNT82 \u2192 t6\nNT51 \u2192 t20\nNT5 \u2192 t35\nNT28 \u2192 t10\nNT64 \u2192 t23\nNT44 maybe?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not listing all correctly.

{"custom_id":"request-958","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and each token seems to correspond to a variable in the grammar. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. The grammar starts with S -> NT9 NT5, which is the start symbol. Each production rule is in the form A -> BC, which is Chomsky Normal Form. So each non-terminal (NT) produces two other non-terminals until we reach terminals, which are the 't' followed by digits and some variables that eventually expand into these 't' tokens.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT9, NT5, NT52, NT89, etc., all eventually resolve to 't' followed by numbers or specific 't' symbols. For example, NT9 eventually becomes 't10', NT5 becomes 't25', and others like NT6, NT8, etc., resolve into various 't' tokens.\n\nThe input string is: t10 t14 t12 t36 t3 t15 t34 t35 t5 t10 t23 t24 t9 t3 t26 t15 t6 t8 t31 t22 t15 t32 t31 t34 t35 t25 t2 t5 t3 t6 t20 t3 t22 t10 t4 t25 t12 t20 t31 t4 t22 t14 t20 t10 t32 t3 t5 t9 t8 t35.\n\nEach token in the string must correspond to a terminal symbol derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals, so the derivation tree will be a binary tree.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the string must be a sequence of terminals, each step being the result of applying productions. Each symbol in the string must come from some production rule that can derive it directly.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string step by step and see if each token is accounted for by the grammar, starting from S.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT9 NT5. So the first part of the string should derive from NT9 and NT5. Let me check the first few tokens.\n\nThe string starts with t10, which corresponds to NT9. From the grammar, NT9 can be \"t10\" (looking at the production rules, yes, for example, NT95 -> NT79 NT42, but NT9 directly becomes 't10' somewhere else. Let me check: looking for NT9 in the rules... Ah, I see NT90 -> NT70 NT80, but that's for '80' not '10'. Wait, looking further, in the rules, I see NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT10 is another rule, but that doesn't directly help. Wait, in the rules, I see NT9 becomes 't10' via NT89 -> NT72 NT83 (where nt72 -> t35, and nt83 -> something else). Wait, maybe I should look for NT9 directly producing 't10'. Let me scan the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT90 is not present. Wait, in the rules, I see:\n\nNT10 -> NT84 NT25, and NT84 -> NT28 NT8, etc. Wait, maybe I should check all the NT rules to see where a terminal symbol like 't10' appears.\n\nLooking through, for example, NT10 appears in several rules: NT10 -> NT26 NT16, NT15 -> NT27 NT60, etc. But to get 't10', maybe it's through a production where NT10 is a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT10 -> 't26' and NT10 -> 't26' again. So NT10 can be 't26', but that doesn't help. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check NT10 in the rules again. I see NT10 -> NT26 NT16 and NT10 -> something else? No, looking again: the rule appears twice: NT10 -> NT26 NT16 and also NT10 -> 't26' somewhere? Wait, no. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nIn the list, I see:\n\nNT84 -> NT28 NT8\n\nNT28 -> NT10 NT8\n\nSo NT28 can be NT10 and NT8.\n\nThen, NT10 is: looking for 't1' 't2' etc. in the rules, I see:\n\nNT10 -> 't26' : yes, the rule is NT10 -> 't26'.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 -> 't15', NT22 -> 't15' and 't9', etc.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first token is 't10'. So I need to see if there is a production for NT9 that produces 't10' or part of it. Alternatively, perhaps the start symbol's first expansion is NT9 and NT5, each of which must derive to some sequence that starts with 't10' and something else.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to think about the entire string as a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string starts with t10 t14 t12... etc.\n\nSo the first two symbols must correspond to the start production S -> NT9 NT5. So the first half must be NT9's derivation, and the second half NT5's.\n\nBut since the grammar is context-free, each NT can independently derive a string, but the way they combine affects the entire string.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to see if the entire string can be broken down into the productions, ensuring that each symbol corresponds to a derived terminal from the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking at each symbol and see if it can be traced back to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe first symbol is 't10', which must come from NT10. Looking at the rules, NT10 can be 't26', but that's not 't10'. Wait, is there any NT that directly produces 't10'? Looking again, in the rules:\n\nLooking for 't10' as a terminal. I see NT28 can be 't10' via NT28-> 't10'?\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the rules, under NT28: no, NT28 is never a terminal; it's a non-terminal. The only terminals are the 't' followed by some digits.\n\nWait, so the rules seem to be written as NT<something> -> other NT symbols or terminals followed by numbers.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see lines like NT66 -> 't3', so that would mean that NT66 can be replaced by 't3', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, other rules like NT15 -> 't4', NT22->'t15' etc.\n\nSo each NT can be a terminal, or another NT. So the derivation steps involve replacing NTs with their possible expansions until all NTs are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo for each symbol in the string, it must correspond to a terminal that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nNow, let's look at each symbol in the string and see if they are terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nGiven the list of terminals in the rules, I can make a list:\n\nLooking through all the rules, the terminals are:\n\n' t1 to t28 ', ' t29 to t35 '.\n\nSpecifically, the rules have:\n\n'nt22' -> 't15', nt22->'t9'\n\n'nt23' -> 't15', 't34'\n\n'nt24' -> 't24'\n\nWait, no. The rules have lines like:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9'\n\nSo the terminals are 't1', 't2' up to 't35', except that some are not present in the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire string is made up of terminals that are present in the grammar.\n\nSo let me list all the terminals based on the given rules.\n\nThe terminals are as per the rules for each NT:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\nNT60: NT60 -> ... etc.\n\nBut wait, it's faster to just collect all the terminals in the rules.\n\nFrom the provided rules:\n\nLooking for any NT which directly resolves to a 't' followed by digits.\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT22 is replaced by 't15' and 't9'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- nt44 is not a terminal; it goes into 't35'\n- Similarly, NT10 can sometimes be 't26'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string has five tokens, each corresponding to a production in the grammar. The tokens are connected by spaces, so each one is a separate element in the parse tree. \n\nLooking at the string: `t35`, `t37`, `t35`, `t9`, `t22`. Each of these is either a terminal or a result of a production rule. From the grammar, I can map these tokens to their respective non-terminals. \n\n- `t35` corresponds to `NT84`.\n- `t37` corresponds to `NT52`.\n- `t9` corresponds to `NT9`.\n- `t22` corresponds to `NT22`.\n\nStarting from the start symbol `S`, let's see the possible derivations. The first production is `S -> NT52 NT95`. Wait, that's not matching the string. Maybe I should check other productions for S. But in the provided grammar, S only has one production: `S -> NT52 NT95`. Hmm, that's confusing because the initial production for S is `NT52 NT95`, which would have to derive to the input.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar's start symbol is S, and the first production is `S -> NT52 NT95`. So the string should be a derivation from NT52 and NT95. Let me check the string: the first token is `t35`, which is NT84, not NT52 or NT95. That doesn't seem to fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check again. S is indeed `S -> NT52 NT95`, so the string should start with either NT52 or NT95. But in the given string, the first token is `t35`, which is NT84, so that doesn't seem to match. Maybe the string is not generated by this grammar because the first symbol doesn't come from the initial production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the tokens.

Wait, looking at the mappings:\n\n- NT52: 't37' (from NT52 -> NT64 NT96, which becomes 't37')\n- NT52: 't37' (also from NT52 -> NT60 NT81, which becomes 't37')\n- NT84 is 't5' (from NT84->NT28 NT8, which is 't5')\n- NT93 is 't4'\n- NT26 is 't14' (from NT26->NT73 NT25, which is 't14')\n- NT22 is 't34' (from NT22->NT42 NT70, which is 't34') and also others.\n\nBut the string starts with `t35`, which is NT84, but S only has NT52 and NT95 as its first step. So if the string starts with `t35`, which is NT84, it can't be derived from S because S first produces NT52 or NT95.\n\nWait, maybe the initial production for S is S->NT52 NT95, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the order. NT52 is 't37' and NT95 is 't4'. So the initial expansion would be 't37' followed by 't4'. But the string starts with 't35', which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is being parsed somewhere else, but the start symbol is S, so it's unlikely. Unless there's a way to derive NT84 and NT52 from S, but looking at the grammar, S only produces NT52 and NT95. There's no production for NT52 that starts with NT84, so NT84 can't be derived from S.\n\nTherefore, the string starts with a symbol that isn't produced directly from S, which means it's not part of the language defined by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-44","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if the given string `t35 t25 t8 t15 t22` is generated by a specific context-free grammar provided in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar is in Chomsky normal form if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I see that all the rules on the left side of the arrow are NT followed by two other NTs or a terminal. So, yeah, it's in Chomsky normal form. Good.\n\nNext, the goal is to check if the string `t35 t25 t8 t15 t22` can be derived from the start symbol S. The string consists of a sequence of terminals, each 't' followed by numbers. I'm assuming these are the strings that the grammar can produce at the leaves of the parse tree.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to try to find a derivation path from S to the given string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, every production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string we're given must be composed of such terminal steps.\n\nLet me try to break down the string into its components: t35, t25, t8, t15, t22. Each of these must correspond to a production rule where a non-terminal directly expands into that string when it's a terminal. So, I need to see if each of these terminals appears as the consequence of a series of productions starting from S.\n\nFirst, let's consider the overall structure. The start symbol S is \"S \u2192 NT9 NT5\". So, the start symbol expands into NT9 and NT5. These are two non-terminals, and each must derive a string, presumably their respective parts of the input.\n\nSo, let's consider the input string as two parts: t35... and t25.... Wait, no, actually the input string is five terminals, so maybe it's better to think of the entire string as a combination of several steps expanding from NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see: Each non-terminal in the grammar eventually derives a string of terminals, so S is NT9 NT5, so the entire string should be the concatenation of what NT9 derives and what NT5 derives. Therefore, the entire string should be a sequence of terminals from NT9's derivation followed by NT5's derivation.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of these non-terminals expand to other non-terminals, but for some, they directly produce terminals. Let me see which non-terminals have direct terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see several entries where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT26 \u2192 't36', etc. So, some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, but each direct production in the grammar (like A \u2192 a) produces a single terminal, so any string generated by the grammar can have multiple terminals, each directly from a production, possibly nested through a series of non-terminals.\n\nBut since the string is five terminals, I need to see if we can find a way for S's expansion to produce this string, perhaps through multiple steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to reconstruct the parse tree for the string `t35 t25 t8 t15 t22` by working backwards or forwards.\n\nLet me try to see the structure:\n\nSince S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansion of NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, the first part is NT9 and the second part is NT5. Therefore, the string should split into two parts, each corresponding to the derivations of NT9 and NT5, respectively.\n\nWait, but let me check the terminal breakdown to see how many terminals are in each part. The string is `t35 t25 t8 t15 t22`, which is five tokens. Let me see:\n\n- Could NT9 expand to 3 terminals (like t35, t25, t8) and NT5 expand to 2 (t15, t22)? Or maybe differently.\n\nBut first, let's look at what each non-terminal can produce. For example, NT9 can be obtained from NT35, perhaps? Wait no, NT9 is in the grammar on the left side of some rules. Looking through the rules, I don't immediately see NT9 as a non-terminal. Wait, actually, looking at the rules: NT9 appears on the right side. Let's see its production.\n\nWait the rule is NT9: looking through all the left-hand sides, I don't see NT9 on the left. Wait, no, actually, some rules might involve NT9 on the left side.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the grammar rules again. For example, looking for NT9: the rules are:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\n- NT79 \u2192 NT2 NT16\n- NT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56\n- NT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60\n- etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule where NT9 is on the left side except maybe one. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking through each line, I only see NT9 appearing on the right-hand sides. So, in the initial step, S is NT9 NT5, but in the grammar rules, there's no production of NT9 on the left. Hmm, that might be a problem because if NT9 is on the right side, but isn't a non-terminal because it's not on the left of any production, then the grammar doesn't allow it to produce anything. Wait, that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh, wait, I see that the initial rule for S is \"S -> NT9 NT5\". Then, looking through the other rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\n- etc., but where is NT9 on the left?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some production where NT9 is the left side.

{"custom_id":"request-67","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string `t35 t6 t37 t24 t15 t35` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, let me recall what the grammar looks like. It's a set of production rules that rewrite non-terminal symbols into other symbols, including terminals and other non-terminals. Since this is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: t35, t6, t37, t24, t15, t35. So, each token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. My goal is to see if there's a way for the grammar's start symbol, S, to derive this string through a series of applications of the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly correspond to terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 t34, NT2 \u2192 t6, NT6 \u2192 t25, etc. So, during the derivation, these non-terminals can be replaced directly by their terminals.\n\nNow, the string has six tokens, so I'll need to check if the derivation can produce six steps. Let's start by looking for the first symbol, t35. From the grammar, NT78 \u2192 t35. That's because the production rule says NT78 produces t35. So, the first non-terminal symbol would have to be NT78.\n\nSo, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT52 NT89 NT93. Wait, no, looking back, the initial production given is S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Wait, no, the first production is `S -> NT9 NT52`. Wait, that can't be right because S usually has a single production, but in the given grammar, S is rewritten into NT9 and NT52. Wait, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Oh, the initial production is S -> NT9 NT52. Hmm, that would mean S can produce two non-terminals, NT9 and NT52. Wait, but then I need to expand both of these. Let me see what NT9 and NT52 produce.\n\nNT9 is in the grammar, and looking at it, it's part of the production NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. But in the grammar provided, there's a rule NT9 -> NT72 NT23. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but in the list, it's written as:\n\nWait, let me parse the entire grammar correctly. Each production is written as `<NT Name> -> RHS`. So for example, the first production is `S -> NT9 NT52`. Then, looking for NT9 and NT52.\n\nNT9: Looking through the list, I see NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Oh, that's one production. So NT9 can be replaced by NT72 and NT23. \n\nSimilarly, NT52 appears in multiple productions. The second production is `NT52 -> NT89 NT35`, so NT52 \u2192 NT89 and NT35.\n\nWait, but let me get this straight. Each non-terminal (like NT9, NT52, etc.) has their own production rules. So, S produces NT9 and NT52, which are then expanded further.\n\nSo, for the string `t35 t6 t37 t24 t15 t35`, each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol in the grammar. So, each token must be generated by expanding a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nLet me approach this step by step. The string is six symbols long, so the derivation must expand into six terminals. Since S is a terminal production only through other non-terminals, we'll have to expand S and then each of the resulting non-terminals until we get to terminals.\n\nLet me consider S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Then, each of NT9 and NT52 needs to be expanded.\n\nStarting with NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So, NT9 becomes NT72 and NT23.\n\nNow, NT72's production: Looking through the rules, NT72 \u2192 't35' (I see a rule NT72 \u2192 t35). So, NT72 can directly produce t35.\n\nNT23's production: Checking the rules, NT23 \u2192 't15'. So, NT23 can produce t15.\n\nSo, after expanding S, the first two steps give us t35 and t15. So far, we have t35 t15. But the first token in our string is t35, followed by t6, t37, t24, t15, t35. So, after the first two symbols, we're at t35 t15, which doesn't match t35 t6 yet.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of expansion. Wait, S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Then, perhaps we need to expand NT9 first or NT52 first.\n\nWait, maybe we need to consider the order in which non-terminals are expanded. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe string starts with t35. Let's see where t35 comes from. Looking at the grammar, NT78 \u2192 t35. So, perhaps at some point, a non-terminal is expanded to NT78, which then becomes t35.\n\nWait, let me look back. The production rules for NTs leading to t35: Looking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t35\n\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n\n- NT22 (twice: \u2192 t34 and \u2192 t15)\n\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t41\n\nWait, I think I might have to find a path that leads from S through a series of expansions to eventually produce each token in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree from the string upwards. Let me see if the string can be divided into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first token is t35. We have NT78 \u2192 t35. So, we can think of t35 as the expansion of NT78.\n\nThen, perhaps the next token, t6, must be part of some expansion that comes after NT78. Alternatively, perhaps the first part is NT78 t35, then something else.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to attempt a step-by-step parse.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if each token can be matched by a non-terminal's production.\n\nLet's list the tokens: [t35, t6, t37, t24, t15, t35]\n\nLooking up each token in the grammar's productions to see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\n- t35: produced by NT78.\n- t6: Looking for a production that ends with t6. Checking the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t25, which is not t6. Wait, no t6 is produced by NT22 \u2192 t34, no. Hmm, looking through all, I don't see a production for t6 except for NT22 \u2192 t34 and NT22 \u2192 t15. Wait, no t6 is produced, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nWait, let me check again.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side, I can probably parse the string using a method suitable for CNF, like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the string. It has six tokens separated by spaces, so it's a sequence of six tokens. Each token corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. My task is to see if there's a derivation path that generates exactly this string starting from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and in the grammar, S -> NT9 NT5. So the first thing to note is that the string must start with whatever symbols derive to NT9 and NT5, respectively. NT9 and NT5 are themselves non-terminals, so I'll need to see their productions.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT9:\n\nWait, actually, looking through the provided grammar, I don't see any NT9 production.

Looking again, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT89 -> NT72 NT83\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n\nNo, there's no production for NT9 that directly goes to the first part of the string's first token 't35'. Alternatively, perhaps the string is a series of symbols derived from NT9 and NT5, each of which are non-terminals that can only produce certain sequences.\n\nWait, stepping back: The given string's first symbol is 't35', which according to the rules is produced by NT73 (NT73 -> 't34') and perhaps other NTs. But 't35' is not directly a production; wait, looking at all the rules, is 't35' a terminal? Let me check each rule for 't35':\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't35'.

{"custom_id":"request-87","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to determine whether the string `t35 t6 t37 t10 t37 t34 t22` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll familiarize myself with the grammar rules. The grammar starts with the start symbol S and has production rules that expand S and other non-terminals (NTs) into other non-terminals or terminals ('t' followed by a number). My string is all in terms of 't' followed by numbers, which suggests that each 'tX' might correspond to a terminal in the expansion of a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: `t35 t6 t37 t10 t37 t34 t22`. It has seven elements, each a terminal. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if it can be derived by expanding the start symbol S through the production rules.\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each non-terminal can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. That means when generating the string, each step can produce one terminal followed by others, or keep splitting non-terminals until all leaves are terminals.\n\nI'll start with the start symbol S. Let's see what S can produce. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. That would produce two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5, each of which can be expanded.\n\nNow, I need to follow the string's sequence and see if the non-terminals can expand to match the terminals in the order they appear.\n\nThe string starts with t35. So, let me see which NT can produce t35. Looking at the production rules for NTs:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9' (NT22 has multiple rules), NT2 \u2192 't6', NT4 \u2192 't35' (twice), etc. Wait, NT4 \u2192 't35' and 't22' (NT4: NT83 NT96 \u2192 't22' and NT42 \u2192 't24', and others like 't35' comes from NT4 with certain productions).\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, some rules expand to terminals:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96 and also NT83 NT22, etc. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, some of the NTs directly go to terminals.

Also, in later lines, another rule 'NT22 -> 't34''). Hmm, that can't be right because a non-terminal can only have one production, unless I misread.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar is presented as multiple lines, each line is a rule. For example:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\n...\nBut then another line for NT22: NT22 -> 't9'\nAnd another: NT22 -> 't34'\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because a non-terminal can only have one production rule. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or maybe it's a typo.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended to list multiple options. Alternatively, perhaps each line represents a separate rule for the same non-terminal. For example, maybe NT22 has three rules: NT22 -> 't15', NT22 -> 't9', and NT22 -> 't34'. That would imply NT22 can produce any of those, but in CFGs, that's not allowed. So perhaps the user should have used different non-terminals or merged these.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to have one rule with multiple options, perhaps using '|' or something. But in any case, it's unclear. Since the user presented the grammar, I need to proceed based on what's given. So, looking at the lines for NT22:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo, perhaps in the actual grammar, NT22 can produce any of 't15', 't9', or 't34'. So, when expanding NT22, it can choose any of these terminals.\n\nSimilarly, for other non-terminals, if they have multiple rules leading to terminals, they can produce any of them.\n\nSo, for NT22, each expansion can choose to be 't15', 't9', or 't34'.\n\nSame goes for NT22 as mentioned. So, now, back to the string.\n\nThe string is `t35 t6 t37 t10 t37 t34 t22`. Seven terminals.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo the first expansion is S \u2192 NT9 NT52.

{"custom_id":"request-85","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the string `t35 t6 t24 t5 t24 t15 t22` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. \n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side consists of either two terminals or two non-terminals. This form is useful for parsing and for checking membership by tracking derivation paths.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, most of the productions have two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S -> NT9 NT5. But there are some productions that directly link non-terminals to terminals, like NT22 -> 't15' or NT6 -> 't25'. These are the rules that will help us trace the string back to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string we're checking is `t35 t6 t24 t5 t24 t15 t22`. Since it's a list of terminals separated by spaces, each token in the string should correspond to a terminal in the productions.\n\nStarting from S, the first step is to see if the entire string can be decomposed using the productions of S. S production is S -> NT9 NT5. So S starts as NT9 followed by NT5.\n\nThe string starts with `t35`. Let me see which production ends with `t35`. Looking through the rules, I see NT22 -> 't22' and NT27 -> 't24', but none directly produce 't35' except maybe NT95 which becomes 't10' and 't11', etc. Wait, looking through the terminal productions, I see NT70 -> 't26' and NT84 -> 't5' perhaps? \n\nWait, let me look through the grammar again. I see some rules that end with terminal strings of one token. For example, NT2 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't25', NT15 -> 't4', and so on. But I'm trying to find where 't35' comes from. \n\nLooking through the terminal rules, I notice that NT35 isn't directly mapping, but maybe the non-terminal that when expanded produces 't35' is not directly available. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I don't see any rule that ends with 't35' except for NT27 -> 't24' which is not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the rules again. \n\nLooking at the grammar, here's a list of terminal rules:\n\n- NT70 -> 't26'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT84 -> 't5'\n- NT95 -> 't8'\n- Wait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT70 -> 't78' -> 't40'\n- NT22 -> 't15','t9','t34'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT9 -> 't72','t23'\n- NT39 -> 't22'\n- NT8 -> 't2','t10'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT73 -> 't34'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n\nWait, looking again, I might have missed a rule. Oh, here's NT70 -> 't78' and 't40', and NT36 has a rule that goes to 't41'. Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the rules that have 't35'.\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any rule that ends with 't35' directly. However, maybe there's a non-terminal that can produce a string that includes 't35' as part of a longer derivation. Alternatively, perhaps the string includes intermediate steps that aren't directly terminals but need to be further expanded.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't35', which is a terminal symbol. That suggests that the first part of the derivation must start with a production that directly yields 't35', unless 't35' is a result of a longer expansion, which isn't possible because 't35' is a single token. So, we need a production where a non-terminal directly produces 't35'. \n\nScanning the terminal rules, I see:\n\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT95 -> 't72' (but wait, that's 't72', not 35)\n- Wait, maybe I'm not looking correctly. Let me list all the terminal rules:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT89 -> 't72', 't83'\n- NT9 -> 't72', 't23'\n- NT70 -> 't26', 't78' (and 't40'?)\nWait, no, let me look again carefully.\n\nThe terminal rules are:\n\n- NT70 -> 't26'  (I think that's for NT70: 't26')\nWait, no, wait the rules given are:\n\nLooking at the rules, each line is a production of the form NTX -> ... where ... can be two NTs or a terminal.\n\nLooking through, I see for example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT9 -> 't72','t23'\n- NT39 -> 't22'\n- NT8 -> 't2','t10'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT73 -> 't34'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT95 -> 't8','t9'\n- NT85 -> 't21','t4'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n\nWait, so looking for any rule that ends with 't35'\u2014it doesn't seem to be there. So that's a problem because the first token is 't35', which implies that a non-terminal must directly produce 't35' as a terminal. But in the given grammar, none of the non-terminals produce 't35' as a terminal. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Maybe I missed a rule. Let me go through the list again:\n\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT35 -> ...? Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT35 as a non-terminal with a terminal. But wait, is there any production where a non-terminal produces 't35'?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT70 -> 't26' (line:70 -> 't26')\n- NT22 -> 't15','t9','t34' (line:22->'t34')\n- NT36 -> ... (no terminals)\n- NT10 -> 't26','t80' (10->'t26')\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine all terminal productions:\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\n- S -> NT9 NT5 ... etc., which are non-terminals.\n\nThen specific terminal productions:\n\n- NT70 -> 't26' (line:70 -> 't26')\n- NT22 -> 't15' (line:22->15)\n- NT22 -> 't9' (line:22->9)\n- NT22 -> 't34' (line:22->'t34')\n- NT26 -> 't14' (line:26->14)\n- NT49 -> 't8' (line:49->8)\n- NT13 -> 't31' (line:13->31)\n- NT9 -> 't72','t23' (line:9->72 and 23)\n- NT39 -> 't22' (line:39->22)\n- NT8 -> 't2','t10' (line:8->2 and 10)\n- NT28 -> 't10' (line:28->10)\n- NT73 -> 't34' (line:73->34)\n- NT87 -> 't36' (line:87->36)\n- NT95 -> 't8','t9' (line:9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-100","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and a string to check if it belongs to the language defined by the grammar. Let me break this down step by step to figure out the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal (like S, NT5, etc.) expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Since it's in CNF, all rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. Each production rule's left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe given string is \"t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t37 t15 t22\". Each \"t\" followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI'll start by considering the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the derivation tree for any string will be a binary tree, and the length of the string will be 2^n, where n is the height of the tree. Wait, let me check the string length: it's 12 tokens, which is 2^3 + 1 (since 8 is 2^3). Hmm, actually, 12 isn't a power of two, so maybe the structure isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting symbol S is the root, and each production is applied until leaves (terminals) are reached. Each step appends two symbols. But the string here is a sequence of terminals, and each step in CNF appends one terminal or two non-terminals. So, the number of symbols in the string should be 2^n for some n, but 12 is not a power of two. That might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe I can think that the production rules can lead to mixed terminal and non-terminal steps, but in CNF, the RHS is only two symbols, which could include one terminal and one non-terminal, and so on.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, when expanding, each step can replace a non-terminal with two symbols (either both non-terminals, or one terminal and one non-terminal, or both terminals). But I think that in the derivation, we start from the start symbol S and keep applying productions until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in this case, the string is 8 symbols. Let me count: t35, t6, t24, t5, t10, t37, t15, t22. That's 8 symbols, which is 2^3, so maybe the derivation has a height of 3.\n\nI need to find a way to break down the string into a tree of productions. Let's consider the start symbol S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, S expands into two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. Each of these will be expanded further.\n\nLet me consider NT9 and NT5:\n\nNT9 can produce NT35 NT5 (since looking up, I see NT93 doesn't seem relevant for NT9? Wait, wait, looking back:\n\nThe productions are given as NT93 -> ... etc. Wait, I might be misunderstanding the notation. The NT symbols are like NT9, NT10, etc. So, each NTx is a non-terminal. Now, looking for NTx -> ... rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11\nNT10 -> NT84 NT25\nNT36 -> NT35 NT56, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT productions and look for how they can lead to terminals.\n\nFor example, NT22 has the rule that it can produce 't15' (meaning terminal t15) and another non-terminal 't9' (another terminal?), or does NT22 have multiple rules? Looking back at the rules, I see NT22 has two rules:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' (terminal t15)\nNT22 \u2192 't9' (terminal t9)\n\nNo, actually, looking again, the rules are:\n\nLooking for NT22:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' is one rule, another is NT22 \u2192 't9'? No, let me check again. In the given grammar, under NT22, it's written as NT22 \u2192 't15' and also NT22 \u2192 't9'? Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe provided grammar has under NT22:\n\n\"NT22 -> 't15'\"\n\"NT22 -> 't9'\"\n\nSo, NT22 can be replaced by either 't15' or 't9'. So, in the string, we have \"t15\", \"t9\" appearing.\n\nIn the given string, we have 't15' and 't22' which is 't15' as per NT22's production.\n\nWait, the string includes 't22' but in the context of NT22's production, it's either 't15' or 't9'. So, in the string, a 't22' might not directly correspond unless the NT22 is producing a terminal t22, but looking through the rules, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't22' directly.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly expands into 't22'. Hmm. That might be a problem because if 't22' isn't directly produced, then perhaps it's a non-terminal in the derivation that's becoming 't22' through some other expansion. But in this grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly leads to 't22'. So, perhaps that's an issue.\n\nWait, let's list the terminals and see which NTs can produce each terminal.\n\nFrom the rules, the direct terminal productions (where a rule produces a 't' followed by a number) are as follows:\n\nLooking for NTx \u2192 a terminal:\n\nLooking back, for each NTX rule, are any of them ending with a terminal 't' followed by a number?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14' or 't25'\n- NT4 \u2192 't35' (from NT4 rule)\n- NT5 -> 't22' (from NT5 rule)\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (from NT6 rule)\n- NT8 \u2192 't2' (from NT8 rule)\n- NT10 \u2192 't26' (from NT10 rule)\n- NT11 \u2192 't41' (from NT11 rule)\n- NT13 \u2192 't31' (from NT13 rule)\n- NT14 \u2192 't23' (NT14)\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (NT15)\n- NT23 \u2192 't9' (NT23)\n- NT24 \u2192 't5' (NT24)\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (NT25)\n- NT26 \u2192 't14' or 't25' (NT26)\n- NT27 \u2192 't36' (NT27)\n- NT28 \u2192 't15' (NT28)\n- NT35 \u2192 't40' (NT35)\n- NT36 \u2192 't39' or 't41', etc.\n- NT39 \u2192 't22'\nWait, I think I might have missed some.

The string in question is `t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t37 t15 t35`, and the grammar is provided with a bunch of production rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This structure is useful because it simplifies the parsing process, typically used in algorithms like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm manually checking the string, I don't think CYK is necessary here. Instead, I might try to trace back from the string to the start symbol, which is S.\n\nThe string consists of a series of terminals: t35, t6, t24, t5, t10, t37, t15, t35. My task is to see if these can all be derived from S using the given production rules.\n\nLet me list the production rules that involve terminals, as those might help me backtrack:\n\nLooking through the list, I see several productions that directly translate non-terminals to terminals, or sequences of them.\n\nFor example:\n- NT2 \u2192 t6 (from production NT22 \u2192 't24'? Wait, no. Wait, looking back: \n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, there are some in the 'Productions' section that map certain non-terminals to 't' and specific numbers. For instance, NT22 \u2192 't24' (line 22), so NT22 is a non-terminal that can produce 't24'. Similarly, other rules have 't' followed by a number, which probably represent 't' plus a digit.\n\nWait, let me double-check the production rules provided:\n\nThe production rules are a bit lengthy, but I noticed some like:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24' (line 22)\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (another line)\n- NT22 \u2192 't9' (another line)\n- NT55 \u2192 't20' (line 55)\n- NT80 \u2192 't26' (line 80)\n- NT56 \u2192 't36' (line 56)\n- NT10 \u2192 't26' (line 10)\n- NT72 \u2192 't35' (line 72)\n- NT78 \u2192 't40' (line 78)\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (line 6)\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (line 15)\n- NT2 \u2192 't6' (line 2)\n- NT66 \u2192 't3' (line 66)\n- NT22 \u2192 't34' (another line)\n- NT4 \u2192 't35' (line 4)\n- NT84 \u2192 't5' (line 84)\n- NT85 \u2192 't4' (line 85)\n- NT28 \u2192 't15' (line 28)\n- NT66 \u2192 't4' (line 66)\n- NT60 \u2192 't12' (line 60)\n- NT36 \u2192 't41' (line 36)\n- NT56 \u2192 't37' (line 56)\n- NT82 \u2192 't6' (line 82)\n- NT51 \u2192 't20' (line 51)\n- NT5 \u2192 't35' (line 5)\n- NT26 \u2192 't14' (line 26)\n- NT64 \u2192 't23' (line 64)\n- NT49 \u2192 't8' (line 49)\n- NT13 \u2192 't31' (line 13)\n- NT8 \u2192 't2' (line 8)\n- NT86 \u2192 't34' (line 86)\n- NT14 \u2192 't23' (line 14)\n- NT39 \u2192 't22' (line 39)\n- NT73 \u2192 't34' (line 73)\n- NT87 \u2192 't36' (line 87)\n- NT4 \u2192 't34' (line 4)\n- NT10 \u2192 't22' (line 10)\n- NT55 \u2192 't35' (line 55)\n- NT13 \u2192 't4' (line 13)\n- NT4 \u2192 't34' (line 4)\n- NT88 \u2192 't5' (line 88)\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (line 25)\n- NT42 \u2192 't24' (line 42)\n- NT63 \u2192 't32' (line 63)\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier; I should list all the production rules that directly translate to terminals.

Wait, looking at the rules again, line 10 is NT10 \u2192 NT72 NT80, and another line is NT10 \u2192 't26' (line 10). So NT10 can either become 't26' or something else. Similarly, NT55 is 't20' (line 55), NT80 is 't26' (line 80), and NT10 is 't26' or another production.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the direct terminal productions:\n\nLet me go through each production line and check if any of them directly produce a terminal string.\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- Line 1: S \u2192 NT9 NT5 \u2192 Not terminal.\n- Line 2: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35 \u2192 Not.\n- Line 3: NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT84 \u2192 Wait, line 3: NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\u2192 Maybe not.\n- Wait, let me look for any rule where a non-terminal is directly converted to a string of terminals.\n\nLooking through all lines, it's clear that most rules are non-terminals producing other non-terminals. However, there are several cases where non-terminals directly produce terminal strings, possibly with numbers or 't's. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Line 10: NT10 \u2192 't26' (I think line 10 is S \u2192 something else in line 10, wait: no, looking back. No, line 4 is NT4 \u2192 a production. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the lines. I think each line represents NTx \u2192 something.\n\nWait, perhaps each line is for a NTx and its production. For example:\n\nLine 22: NT22 \u2192 't24' (and also other lines?) No, wait, line 22 is NT22 \u2192 't24', but then other NT22 rules are elsewhere. So each line corresponds to a specific NTx and its production.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made the list in a way that each rule is on a separate line. So perhaps NT22 appears multiple times with different productions.\n\nLooking again, let me check each production line. Here's how I'll approach it:\n\n- For each production, if the right-hand side is a sequence of terminals or a single terminal, note it.\n\nLooking through each line:\n\n- Line 22: NT22 \u2192 't24' \u2192 So NT22 can directly produce 't24'.\n- Line 10: NT10 \u2192 't26' (I think line 10 is S \u2192 ...

So to derive the string, we start from the start symbol S and apply productions until all symbols are terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S.\n\nThe first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S is split into NT9 and NT5. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT9: from the rules, it can be expanded as:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nNT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nOther rules?

Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT95: NT95 is different. Wait, maybe I'm getting the NTs mixed up. Let me look for NT9.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.

Let's try to break it down into the structure required by the grammar.\n\nFirst, since the start symbol is S, which splits into NT9 and NT5 (S \u2192 NT9 NT5), so the entire string must be NT9 (part 1) concatenated with NT5 (part 2). So, the first part of the string must come from NT9, and the second part from NT5.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: first split would be from t35 to t34 (8 tokens) and the last token t22 as the second part.\n\nWait, but NT9 could produce a string of 8 tokens, and NT5 could produce t22, which is a single token.\n\nWait, but NT5 can produce NT52, which can further produce more NTs, ultimately leading to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the better approach is to work backward from the end.\n\nLet's consider the last part first. The last token is t22. Looking at the grammar rules, which NT produces t22?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT22 has multiple productions to terminals:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't22'\nSo, t22 must come directly from NT22. So the last part of the string must come from NT22.\n\nThus, the second part of the string (t22) comes from NT22, which must be the second part.\n\nSo the second part is t22, which is the output of NT22.\n\nNow, the first part must come from NT9, and the combined first part would need to be generated by NT9.\n\nSo, the first part is t35 t24 t24 t40 t15 t31 t35 t34.\n\nWe need to see if this can be generated by NT9.\n\nLooking at NT9's possible expansions: the available rules for NT93, but not directly for NT9.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the production rules that include NT9. For example, looking at NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, but that's for NT95. Wait, NT93 is part of the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me start by understanding the structure of the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the production rules for the grammar. It starts with S -> NT9 NT5, which splits the process into two non-terminals, each of which seems to produce a sequence of terminals (t's and numbers). The non-terminals like NT9, NT5, NT52, etc., each have their own production rules.\n\nThe string consists of a series of t-commands, each separated by spaces. I'll list them out: t35, t6, t37, t10, t41, t26, t41, t9, t35. \n\nI realize that each of these t's must correspond to a production rule in the grammar. So, I'll try to break down the string into parts that match the possible production rules.\n\nStarting from the beginning, t35. Looking at the grammar, I see NT36 -> NT27 NT43, NT27 -> 't24', and NT43 has rules like NT43 -> NT0 NT96, etc. But wait, I don't see a direct rule for NT35. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, wait, the start is S which becomes NT9 and NT5, so that's the first step.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is designed to parse strings in Chomsky normal form. Let me recall how CYK works. It processes the string in a dynamic programming table, checking for each position and possible non-terminal if there's a production that can generate that substring.\n\nSince S produces NT9 and NT5, I'll need both parts of the string to come from NT9 and NT5, respectively. So, the string is divided into two parts: the left part should generate NT9, and the right part should generate NT5.\n\nLet me split the string as follows:\nLeft part: t35 t6 t37 t10 t41 t26 t41 t9 t35\nRight part: Well, wait, actually, S is NT9 NT5, so the string should be the combination of NT9's production and NT5's production. So, the entire string should be a concatenation of the string generated by NT9 and the string generated by NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT5's production rules are:\n- NT52 -> NT89 NT35\n- NT52 -> NT69 NT81\n- ... and others. Wait, let me list all NT5's rules.\n\nWait, looking back, no, the grammar provided starts with S -> NT9 NT5, but the non-terminals in between are like NT9, NT5, etc. So each of these NT terms can produce a sequence of terminals.\n\nSo, the string starts with NT9 and ends with NT5. So, I'll have to check two parts: left part for NT9 and right part for NT5.\n\nWait, the string provided is a single sequence of t's, but in the context, S produces NT9 followed by NT5. So the string should be a concatenation of the two parts, meaning the first part corresponds to NT9 and the second to NT5. But looking at the string, it's all one sequence, so I might have to split it into two parts where the left part comes from NT9 and the right part from NT5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the grammar rules.\n\nWait, S is NT9 followed by NT5. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT9 produces and what NT5 produces. So the string is divided into two parts at the point where NT9 ends and NT5 starts.\n\nSo, the entire string is a list of t's and numbers. To apply CYK, I need to find the split point where NT9's production ends and NT5's begins.\n\nHow long do the productions for NT9 and NT5 take? Let me list the possible terminals for each non-terminal.\n\nLooking for NT9, which has production rules ending with t's. For example, NT93 -> NT16 NT5, which eventually leads to t's. Let me check:\n\nNT93 production:\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT93 -> NT79 NT42\n- NT93 -> NT6 NT14\nLooking at these, I see that NT93 can produce t's. For instance, NT93 -> NT6 NT14 can lead to t6 and t14 if the rules are followed.\n\nWait, let me check the terminal rules. For example, NT6's production ends with t25: NT6 -> t25, so t6 is a terminal, right? Wait, the grammar rules have lines like NT22 -> t15, so each of these t's are terminals.\n\nWait, so each production in the grammar either goes to a terminal or another non-terminal. So, for example, NT93's production breaks down into more non-terminals until it ends in t's.\n\nSo, for NT9, the possible productions that lead to t's would need to be traced down.\n\nWait, let's see NT9's production rules. From the grammar, I see NT9 -> NT72 NT23. So NT9 must be expanding into NT72 and NT23. Let me check their rules.\n\nNT72: NT72 -> NT24, which then must expand further. Looking for NT24, yes, near the end, NT24 is 't24'. So NT72 -> t24, which would produce t24 as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT23 has production NT23 -> NT93 NT22. So let me see: NT23 expands into NT93 and NT22. NT22 can produce t15 or t9, based on rules like NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9'. So if NT22 is expanded, it can contribute t15 or t9.\n\nPutting this together, the production of NT9 would be:\n\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23\nNT72 -> t24\nNT23 -> NT93 NT22\nNT93 can expand into several options. For example, one of its rules is NT93 -> NT6 NT14. Then NT6 goes to t25, and NT14 can go to t23, which in turn goes to NT93 and NT22 again. But that might not be the right path because it could lead to a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, another production for NT93 is NT93 -> NT79 NT42. Then NT79 can produce 't2' and NT42 can produce t4 or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the CYK table, the string is \"t35 t6 t37 t10 t41 t26 t41 t9 t35\". There are 9 tokens. Each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal. But since we're working with a grammar in Chomsky normal form, each rule is a production of a non-terminal to exactly two non-terminals. But in our grammar, some of the rules are non-terminals producing two terminals and a non-terminal or two non-terminals, but in the given rules, all the right-hand sides are pairs of two non-terminals or two terminals. Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that most rules have two non-terminals, except perhaps some which produce a terminal followed by a non-terminal or vice versa.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine the grammar. For example, S -> NT9 NT5 is a production where S goes to two non-terminals. Similarly, NT9 -> NT72 NT23 is a production where NT9 goes to two non-terminals. Looking through all the rules, they seem to be productions where a non-terminal is divided into two parts, either both non-terminals or one being a terminal.\n\nWait, not exactly. For instance, NT66 -> NT27 NT4, but NT4 also can go further. Wait, but in the grammar as given, most rules involve non-terminals on both sides. Wait, perhaps this is a binary tree grammar, so each production is a non-terminal splitting into two parts.\n\nBut the key is that each step in the derivation splits a non-terminal into two parts, which can themselves be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nTo apply CYK, I need to think about which non-terminals can generate each substring.\n\nBut maybe this is too time-consuming. Alternatively, let's try to see if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponds to a production starting with NT9 and NT5 respectively.\n\nSo, the entire string is 9 tokens. Let's see how each part could generate the left and right.\n\nLet's consider NT9 and NT5:\n\nFor NT9:\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t35, which might come from a terminal in a production.

{"custom_id":"request-141","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, let's see. The string is `t35 t24 t10 t37 t40 t10 t4 t22 t34 t22`, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. \n\nFirst, I should remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, in this grammar, the start symbol S will expand into NT9 NT5, and then each of those non-terminals will keep expanding according to the given rules until we get terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nMy goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying these productions step by step. So, each application of a rule will generate more terms until we reach the string. Since each rule in CNF either produces two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation process should have a direct correspondence with the string's structure.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual tokens: `t35`, `t24`, `t10`, `t37`, `t40`, `t10`, `t4`, `t22`, `t34`, `t22`. Each of these tokens is a terminal symbol, so they must be generated directly by the grammar's terminals or by combining non-terminals that eventually expand to these.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the initial expansion is two non-terminals. Each of these will lead to more expansions. So, the string should be constructed in a way that each part of it can be traced back through these production rules.\n\nI think a good approach is to work backwards. Let's see if the last token, `t22`, can be derived from any non-terminal in the grammar. Looking at the productions, I see that NT22 is present, but I don't have a production rule for NT22 \u2192 something. Wait, looking deeper, there's NT22 \u2192 't34' and another NT22 \u2192 't9'. Hmm, no, actually, in the productions, I see NT22 has two options: NT22 \u2192 't34' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. So, `t22` could come from NT22 if it's derived directly.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I see that NT22 is actually one of the non-terminals, so perhaps it can expand into itself as a terminal? Or am I misreading it? Wait, no, NT22 is a non-terminal, and in the productions, I only see NT22 \u2192 't34' and NT22 \u2192 't9'. Wait, no, actually looking back, I see that NT22 has rules: \n\nWait, looking at the productions:\n\nNT22 -> 't34' and NT22 -> 't9'. So, that means NT22 directly produces 't34' or 't9'. So if a part of the string has `t22`, that would have to come from some NT that produces it, but I don't see any NT that directly produce `t22`. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps I misread the productions. Wait, no, in the list, I actually don't see any production for NT22 except for those two. So perhaps `t22` is a terminal, but in the grammar, there's no NT that produces `t22`. So that might be a problem.\n\nWait, looking again, the grammar productions are given as strings like 't24', 't10', etc., meaning those are the terminal symbols. So, in the grammar, they have rules for NT22 \u2192 't34' and NT22 \u2192 't9', but I don't see NT22 producing 't22'. So, perhaps `t22` cannot be generated from this grammar, which would mean the string cannot be generated. But that might be jumping to conclusions too quickly.\n\nLet me check other parts of the string to see if they can be matched. Starting from `t35`, I look for any NT that produces `t35`. Looking through the productions, I see NT70 \u2192 't78' and 't28' (I think I might be mixing up the NTs). Wait, looking again, for example, NT70 has rules like NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28. But in the productions, I see NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28 is one production, and also NT78 \u2192 't40', NT28 \u2192 't15'. Alternatively, NT28 can produce 't15' or 't66'. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to parse the string using the grammar. Let's try to see the structure of the string. The string has ten tokens: `t35`, `t24`, `t10`, `t37`, `t40`, `t10`, `t4`, `t22`, `t34`, `t22`. Since each production in the grammar either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the derivation must match the string length in a way that each step adds one token or two. Wait, each production step in CNF increases the number of symbols by one (since A \u2192 BC replaces A with two symbols, so the count goes from 1 to 2). So, starting from S, which is two symbols, each step will multiply the count by two. But the string has 10 tokens, which is 2*5, meaning it's possible because each step could be a binary split.\n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right. The number of symbols in the string should be equal to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. So, starting from S, which is at depth 1 (two symbols), each application of a rule in CNF (where A \u2192 BC) will increase the count by one (from one symbol to two), so the number of symbols in the string must be equal to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. The initial S gives two symbols, each of those could be non-terminals that split again, so the number of symbols can grow exponentially. But the given string has 10 tokens. Let me see if that's compatible.\n\nEach time you apply a rule that splits a non-terminal into two, the total number of symbols increases by one. So, starting with 2, each split adds one. So, if you have n splits, you get 2 + n symbols. But the number of splits is the number of times a rule is applied, which is one less than the number of non-terminals. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the number of symbols in the final string is equal to 2^k, where k is the number of splits, but that's when all splits are applied to the same non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try and parse the string step by step, trying to see if each part can be derived.\n\nLet's consider the entire string as a sequence of terminals and try to associate them with the grammar.\n\nThe first token is `t35`. I need to find an NT that can produce `t35`. Looking through the productions, I see that NT70 \u2192 't78' (I think I might be mixing NTs). Wait, NT70 isn't listed directly. Let me check the productions again. Hmm, looking for NT that can produce `t35`. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT70 has a production NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28, but that's not a terminal. So, `t35` must come from some NT that directly produces it, but looking through all the productions, I don't see any NT that directly produces `t35` except possibly through a chain.\n\nWait, for example, looking for NT that can produce 't35'. Hmm, in the productions, there's NT73 \u2192 't35' and NT73 \u2192 't37'. Yes! So, NT73 can directly produce 't35' or 't37'. Therefore, the first token 't35' could come from NT73 \u2192 't35'. \n\nSo, the string starts with NT73 \u2192 't35'. Then, the next token is 't24'. The production for NT24: Wait, no, NT24 isn't in the productions. Wait, looking back, wait, in the production list, there are several NTs like NT24, but I see NT24 is a terminal because 't24' is in the productions. Wait, no, in the grammar, 't24' is a terminal, so NT24 must be a non-terminal that directly produces 't24'.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, certain non-terminals like NT24 are not defined, but instead, 't24' is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-142","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is \"t35 t24 t10 t37 t40 t15 t4 t22 t15 t22\". \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule starts with a non-terminal symbol on the left and is followed by two non-terminals on the right. Some rules might also have a terminal symbol, but since CNF allows only terminals as the rightmost symbol, maybe some rules have a single terminal. I need to check the grammar provided to see if any production rules have a terminal on the right side.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules I see a pattern. For example, some have two non-terminals, but some directly start with a terminal. Wait, let me scan through the rules given. Oh, there's a variety. For example, the rule NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9' which are terminals. Similarly, NT2 -> 't6', NT4 -> 't35', etc. So each production either has two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSince the string is a series of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can generate this string by expanding the start symbol S into these terminals. The approach I'll take is to trace back from the terminals to see if they can be derived from the start symbol by applying the production rules.\n\nLet's break down the string: t35 t24 t10 t37 t40 t15 t4 t22 t15 t22.\n\nI can list these as a sequence of tokens, each being a terminal. Now, let's see if these terminals can be derived by the given grammar.\n\nStarting with the first token, t35. Looking through the rules, I see NT78 -> 't40' but that's not helpful here. Wait, I'm looking for NTs that produce 't35'. Hmm, looking through the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT10 -> 't26' and NT22 -> 't15' but nothing for 't35' yet. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice NT9 -> 't72' and 't23'; NT72 -> 't35' which is a way to get 't35' from NT72. So maybe the first 't35' comes from NT72 -> 't35' and NT72 is a non-terminal.\n\nSo the first token is t35, which comes from NT72 -> 't35'. Then, NT72 must be in the derivation. So we need to find where NT72 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see NT72 as a left-hand side, unless I missed it. Wait, let me check the given rules again:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT78 -> 't40' and NT78 -> 't10' among others. But no NT72. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe the 't35' comes from NT66 -> 't3', 't39'-> 't36', 't93'-> 't6', etc. Wait, no, that's not the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. I need to get to 't35' at the first step. Let's look for which non-terminal can produce 't35'. Looking through all the rules, I see NT12 -> 't10', NT2 -> 't6', NT4 -> 't35', NT6 -> 't25', NT8 -> 't2', etc. So, NT4 -> 't35' is one option.\n\nSo if the first 't35' is from NT4 -> 't35', then we can have S -> NT52 NT95. Wait, no, the initial production for S is S -> NT52 NT95.\n\nWait a minute, no. The initial production is S -> NT52 NT95. Each of these is a non-terminal. So to derive the string, we need to expand S in such a way that each step follows the production rules until we reach terminal symbols.\n\nSo let's consider S -> NT52 NT95. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t35, so maybe NT52 is the left non-terminal that can produce t35. Wait, looking back, NT52 -> NT60 NT81. So that's not a terminal yet. Or NT52 has some other production.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again, I see:\n\nNT52 -> NT60 NT81 (not terminal)\nNT52 -> NT64 NT96 (not terminal)\nNT22 -> 't15'\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by expanding S in multiple steps.\n\nEach token in the string should come from a production in the grammar. So each 'tXYZ' should correspond to a rule where a non-terminal produces 'tXYZ'.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some non-terminals have terminals:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT13 -> 't31'\n... and so on.\n\nSo, for each 'tXYZ' in the string, I need to see if there's a non-terminal NT that rules to that 'tXYZ', i.e., NT -> 'tXYZ'.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\n1. t35: So, which NT has a rule producing t35? Looking at the rules, the only one I see is NT4 -> t35. So, the first character could be from NT4.\n\n2. t24: Similarly, looking for a rule where NT produces 't24'. From the rules, I see NT66 -> 't3', 't4', etc., but no 't24'. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I see NT84 -> 't5', which is a terminal. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see NT66: NT66 -> 't3' and 't4'. So not 't24'.\n\nWait a second, in the provided rules, some non-terminals have multiple productions mixing NTs and terminals. For example, NT78 -> 't40', but also NT78 -> 't51' perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules for any nt that directly produce 't24'. Looking through each production:\n\nLooking through each production, I see NT52 -> 't6' 't15'? Wait, no. Let me take a closer look:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT8 -> 't2'\n\nNT52 -> NT60 NT81 ('t's not here)\nWait, no, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong production. Wait, I think I need to check each rule more carefully.\n\nWait, for example, NT8 -> 't2'\n\nAnother rule: NT12 -> 't10'\n\nNT82 -> 't6' (from another rule?)\n\nWait, let's go methodically.\n\nLooking for each 'tXYZ', see if any rule has that as a production:\n\n1. t35: Looking for production NT -> t35. Found at NT4 -> t35.\n\n2. t24: Looking for production NT -> t24. Let me check all rules:\n\nLooking again through the provided rules:\n\n- NT52-> NT60 NT81: not t24.\n\n- NT22-> 't15' and 't9': not t24.\n\n- NT6-> 't25'?: Wait, NT6 has rules like NT66 -> t3, t4, etc.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that has a production with 't24':\n\nLooking through all the provided rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't24' except perhaps if some non-terminal rules have both NT and terminal at the end.\n\nWait, for example, perhaps NT83 can produce a t24.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT24 isn't in the left-hand side of any production. So perhaps it can't be generated.\n\nWait, no, the terminal is part of the production. So for example, in the production NT26 -> 't14', that's a rule where a non-terminal produces that terminal.\n\nBut I'm looking for any rule where NT ... -> something that ends with the t24. Wait, looking through:\n\nWait, I don't think any of the production rules have a 't24' on the right-hand side except potentially in a production like NT84-> 't5', which is a terminal. Wait no, looking:\n\nIn the given rules, the right-hand sides are either sequences of NTs or a terminal. So to get a 't24' in the string, the grammar must have a non-terminal that can produce 't24' by a single rule, or a production where 't2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can have a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, all the non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT84, etc.) seem to be starting with NT. The start symbol is S, and the initial production seems to be S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the first step is to expand S into NT9 and NT52. \n\nLet me parse the string: it's a sequence of t followed by numbers, separated by spaces.

Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back, the string has t35, t36, t35, t6, t23, etc. I need to find which non-terminals produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n- NT30 \u2192 t55\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT8 \u2192 t39\n- NT86 \u2192 t34\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- NT51 \u2192 t20\n- NT9 \u2192 t72 t23. Wait, that's a bit complicated. \n\nWait, maybe it's easier to build a derivation tree step by step. Starting with S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo, first step: S \u2192 NT9 NT52. Now, I need to expand both NT9 and NT52.\n\nLooking at NT9: Its productions are NT93 and others? Wait, the rule for NT9 is NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. Wait, that doesn't directly produce a terminal. Wait, looking back: \n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Oh, right, the rule is NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So NT9 will expand into NT72 and NT23. Then, each of those can further expand.\n\nSimilarly, NT52 has several productions, including NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, which then can expand. Hmm, this is getting complex. Maybe a better approach is to look up if the given string is a concatenation of terminals that match the possible terminal sequences from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to parse the string from the end or use a CYK algorithm approach, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to see if each 't' in the string can be matched by a production.\n\nBut wait, let's check the string step by step:\n\nThe string is: t35 t36 t35 t6 t23 t22 t26 t37 t23 t9 t35\n\nThat's 11 words, each representing a terminal. So each of these should correspond to a production from some non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the terminal productions:\n\n- t6 comes from NT2.\n- t23: Looking at the rules, NT22 has multiple productions, including \u2192 t15, t9, and also \u2192 t34. Wait, no NT22 \u2192 t23. Hmm, wait, looking at the rules: NT22\u2192 t34, t9, etc. So no direct terminal for t23. Wait, maybe NT22 can produce t34 or t9. Hmm, but in the string, we have t22 appearing in several places, like t22 in the string. But looking at the rules, NT22\u2192 t15, t9, and t34. So t22 doesn't directly correspond to any terminal, unless I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let's look at each 't' in the string and see if any production rules match them.\n\n- t35: Is there a production rule that results in t35? Looking through the terminal rules, I don't see any rule that produces t35 directly. The closest is NT36 \u2192 t41 and NT8 \u2192 t2. Hmm, no t35. Wait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me check again: the rules given include NT10 \u2192 t26, NT88 \u2192 t5, etc. Hmm, I don't see a production for t35. That's a problem because the string has t35, so if no production rule can produce t35, then the string is not derivable. Wait, but some non-terminals expand into sequences that produce t35? Or maybe t35 is part of a non-terminal expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Each 't35' is a terminal, so there must be a production rule that directly yields t35.\n\nLooking back through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t40\n- NT76: No, wait, looking at the production rules, the ones that produce t are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 t6\n\nNT6 \u2192 t25\n\nNT72 \u2192 t34\n\nNT8 \u2192 t39\n\nNT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\n\nNT86 \u2192 t34\n\nNT35: Hmm, let's see NT35's productions. Looking back, NT35\u2192 NT42 NT87. Both are non-terminals, so they don't produce terminals directly.\n\nSimilarly, NT36\u2192 NT35 NT56. Both non-terminals.\n\nLooking for 't35' as a terminal: Hmm, not seeing it in the given rules. Oh wait, maybe a non-terminal expands into a sequence that includes t35. But in the given grammar, the only way to produce a 't' is through the right-hand side, which each rule either ends in a non-terminal or a terminal. So if a non-terminal's production includes a terminal, that's the end of that branch. So for example, if NT35 \u2192 t35, then that's how it would be generated, but in our rules, I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking through all the production rules, I don't see any rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal 't35'. All t's are produced by NT rules that expand into combinations of NTs, but not t35. For example, NT30 \u2192 t55, which is t55, not t35.\n\nSo, since there's no production rule that directly outputs 't35', the string cannot be generated by this grammar.

I don't have a lot of experience with this, but I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the grammar works. It's in CNF, so each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. Each production has only two symbols on the right-hand side because that's a requirement for Chomsky normal form. Let me list out some of the productions to see if they help.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it produces NT9 and NT52. So S -> NT9 NT52. Both NT9 and NT52 are non-terminals.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string from the outside in, trying to match each part to the grammar. Alternatively, I can use a pushdown automaton or a top-down parsing method since the grammar is in CNF, which is suitable for recursive descent parsing.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces, which seems like the output of applying the productions. My job is to see if starting from S, applying the rules, I can derive this string.\n\nLet me write down the string without spaces for clarity:\nt35, t24, t10, t36, t40, t10, t41, t3, t35, t15, t35.\n\nSo it's 11 tokens. I need to see if this sequence can be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I'll see which non-terminals produce terminal symbols directly. For example, NT52 -> nt? Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT22 -> 't15', NT22 -> 't9', etc. Wait, actually, the 't' parts are specific productions where the non-terminal is replaced by a terminal string. For example, NT22 can produce 't15' or 't9'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't6', NT6 -> 't25', etc.\n\nSo some non-terminals produce terminal strings. Each production that ends in a terminal is a terminal production and reduces the count of non-terminals needed.\n\nStarting from S, let's see. S produces NT9 and NT52. So the first two symbols should correspond to NT9 and NT52, which are each non-terminals. Then, each of these can either be further broken down or produce terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t35. Let's see if any of the productions for NT9 or NT52 produce a terminal that starts with t35.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see NT9 or NT52 directly producing something that starts with t35. Wait, let's check each step.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the terminal productions to see which non-terminals can produce which terminals.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to use a stack-based approach, like the CYK algorithm, but since I can't do that manually here, I'll try to see if the string can be broken down.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if each terminal can be matched by top-down parsing.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is [1] t35, [2] t24, [3] t10, [4] t36, [5] t40, [6] t10, [7] t41, [8] t3, [9] t35, [10] t15, [11] t35.\n\nLet me consider the structure starting from S. S is NT9 and NT52.\n\nEach of these can be broken down further until we reach terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if t35 can come from NT9 or NT52.\n\nLooking for NT9 productions. Let me check all the rules where NT9 is on the left side.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT93 -> NT16 NT5, but I don't see a rule where NT9 directly produces any terminal. Wait, checking all the rules for NT9, I don't see any NT9 -> ... where the right side is just a terminal or a terminal string. It seems NT9 is a non-terminal that can be produced by other non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT52, do I see any production for NT52 that outputs a terminal? Let me check the list.\n\nYes, I see NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9', but not NT52. Looking through the list, I don't see NT52 directly having a terminal production. For example, NT25 -> 't25', which is a terminal. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, in the list I have, under NT25, it says NT25 -> 't25'. So when NT25 is used, it becomes 't25'.\n\nSo maybe I can see how t24 comes from NT24, etc.\n\nLet me think. Each time I have a non-terminal, I can substitute it with its productions. So perhaps I need to find a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet's see. Starting with S: NT9 NT52.\n\nThe first symbol is t35. So the first two non-terminals must produce t35. Wait, but S is two non-terminals, so the entire string is a derivation of those two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each non-terminal in S will expand into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, and so on, until we reach the leaves which are terminals, forming the string.\n\nBut it's complicated because each non-terminal can have two productions, and the string could branch out in multiple ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can see if the string has a structure that can be built using the given productions.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t35. Let's see if t35 can be derived from any non-terminal's production. For example, looking for NT35 -> something that can lead to t35.\n\nLooking at the list, NT36 -> NT27 NT43, and NT35-> NT42 NT87, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm going down the wrong path.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start from the end and see if I can find the last part of the string.\n\nThe last symbol is t35. So the last non-terminal before the end must be something that expands to t35. Let's see which non-terminals can directly produce t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT55 -> 't35'. So if a non-terminal expands to NT55, it can produce 't35'.\n\nLooking back, maybe the second to last symbol is t15, which comes from NT15 -> 't4'.\n\nWait, perhaps the substring towards the end is t15 t35, which would require NT15 -> 't4' and NT35 -> some production leading to t35, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I can count the number of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string has 11 symbols, but the grammar starts with S, which is two non-terminals. Each production introduces non-terminals or terminals. The total number of symbols in the string is 11, which is odd because we start with two non-terminals and each step can increase the count by 1 (for each production that is two symbols adding to two, or one symbol if a production is a terminal).\n\nWait, perhaps that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to look for sequences in the string that match any known productions.\n\nLet me see the string again:\n\nt35, t24, t10, t36, t40, t10, t41, t3, t35, t15, t35.\n\nLooking at the start:\n\nt35 is first. So let's see what can produce t35. The non-terminal that can produce 't35' is NT55.\n\nSo perhaps the first NT9 can be NT55.\n\nWait, is that possible? Let me check NT9 productions. Did any of them produce NT55?\n\nLooking back, I don't see NT9 in the productions except as a part of other non-terminals. For example, NT93 -> NT16 NT5, and others. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t35 can come from another production, but I can't find it immediately.\n\nWait, looking at the terminal productions, like NT26 -> 't14', but I don't see 't35' in their terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps NT24 is involved because t24 is in the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT24 isn't a non-terminal; perhaps it's a terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, the right-hand side elements are terminals followed by non-terminals, represented by 't' followed by digits. For example, NT22 -> 't15' is a terminal production.\n\nSo in the string, 't24' is a"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.

If NT35 is a non-terminal, but in the string, we see t35. Wait, that's confusing. Because nt35 is a non-terminal, but the string has t35, which is a terminal. That suggests that the production for NT35 must directly produce t35.\n\nLooking through my earlier list, I see NT52 -> NT60 NT81, but t81 is produced by NT81.

{"custom_id":"request-187","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string is part of the language defined by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar. It looks like it's structured with non-terminals on the left side and productions to other non-terminals or terminals on the right. Each production seems to consist of two non-terminals on the right, except for some that produce a terminal with 't' followed by a number. Those terminal symbols probably signal the end of the derivation.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t24 t10 t37 t6 t4 t15 t22 t4 t35 t34 t22`. I notice that the string starts with a series of 't' followed by numbers, which are probably the terminal symbols that the grammar can produce.\n\nI think the approach here is to work backwards using a reverse approach to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. Since each production splits into two non-terminals, I'll start from the string and try to merge the symbols into larger phrases by finding two consecutive non-terminals that match a production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't35'. I need to see if there's a production in the grammar that results in 't35'. Scanning through the productions, I see NT22 \u2192 t15 and t9, but that's not helpful here. Wait, looking again, I see that NT72 \u2192 t35 t22, and NT22 \u2192 t15 or t9. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up things.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, there's a production like S -> NT9 NT5, which suggests that S is split into NT9 and NT5. Each of these NTs can be further split into other NTs or terminal symbols.\n\nLet me list out all possible 'terminal' productions because those are the end points. For example:\n\n- NT22 -> t15 or t9\n- NT88 -> t5\n- NT25 -> t25\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT35 -> t22? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see production NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87 and other NTs that produce t's. Wait no, NT36 -> t41, NT55 -> t35, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compile a list of the NTs that directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9\n- NT35 \u2192 Not directly, but NT35 has production NT42 NT87, which doesn't produce terminals immediately. Wait, looking again, NT22 is written as NT22 -> t15 and t9. Also, NT22 comes up in other productions like S -> NT9 NT52, which leads to NT89 NT35. Hmm, maybe I need to look for the symbols in the string and see which NTs can derive them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should reconstruct the Parse Tree step by step. Let me start from the beginning.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, NT9 can produce things like NT72 (which goes to t35 t22) or other NTs, and NT5 can produce NT88 (t5) or other NTs.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35, so perhaps NT9 is producing something that starts with t35. Let's see: the first symbol is t35, so looking for NT9 productions that can lead to t35. Hmm, NT9 appears in productions like NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42 and NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Wait, maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, NT72 is a production that yields t35 t22, so if NT72 is part of the NT9 derivation, how does that factor in? \n\nWait, perhaps I should try to build the string step by step. Let's break it down:\n\nThe string is t35 t24 t10 t37 t6 t4 t15 t22 t4 t35 t34 t22.\n\nI need to find a series of productions that, when applied, yield this string.\n\nLooking at the beginning, t35 could come from NT72 \u2192 t35 t22. So maybe we split the string into t35 followed by t22, and that could be the leftmost symbols. But in the string, after t35 comes t24, which is different. So perhaps that's not the right place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t35 comes from another production. Looking at the grammar, NT42 \u2192 t24, so maybe somewhere we have NT42 followed by something else.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The string has multiple t's, so maybe each of those t's comes directly from a terminal production. Maybe we can segment the string into components that each come from a terminal production.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt35, t24, t10, t37, t6, t4, t15, t22, t4, t35, t34, t22.\n\nEach of these is a terminal, so perhaps we can group them into meaningful segments. Each tX is a terminal, so perhaps we can try to build the string as a sequence of these t's.\n\nLet's attempt to parse from the beginning.\n\nt35: Which NT can produce t35? Looking at the grammar, I see NT72 \u2192 t35 t22. So if NT72 is part of the parse, it would produce two t's: t35 and t22.\n\nBut in the string, after t35 comes t24, not t22. So maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, looking for an NT that produces t35 directly. I don't see any NT that directly produces t35; it's only in the context of other NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking at the right-hand sides, for example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9\n- NT24 \u2192 t24 (from where? Wait, looking at the list, I don't see NT24 in the grammar. Wait, no, the grammar's right-hand sides are all pairs of NTs except the ones that produce 'tX'. So for example, there's a rule NT824? No, looking again: under the grammar, I see entries like NT82 -> t6, but I was mistaken earlier.\n\nWait, no, the entire list seems to be production rules, so perhaps I'm not seeing the 't's correctly. Let me parse through the given productions more carefully.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example:\n\n- NT22 -> t15\n- NT95 -> t4\n- NT85 -> t4\n- NT81 -> t4\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT4 -> t35\n- NT8 -> t2\n- NT26 -> t14\n- NT64 -> t23\n- NT49 -> t8\n- NT14 -> t23\n- NT23 -> t92? Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the grammar has a series of entries like:\n\n- NT2 -> t6 (so NT2 \u2192 t6)\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps the 'tX' symbols are terminal symbols, and each production that includes a 'tX' has that as a terminal. So each 'tX' is a single symbol.\n\nSo, for example, NT42 \u2192 t24 is a production that combines a 't24' terminal symbol. Similarly, NT22 \u2192 t15 is a terminal.\n\nSo, to build the string, I can think of the terminal symbols as single letters (t followed by a number).\n\nIn that case, my string is t35, t24, t10, t37, t6, t4, t15, t22, t4, t35, t34, t22.\n\nEach of these is a terminal. So I need to see if the grammar can derive this string by starting from S and replacing non-terminals.\n\nLet's start with S, which is NT9 and NT5.\n\nNT9 can derive various things. Let's look at NT9's productions:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but looking further, there's NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42, which might be relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the string in reverse. Let's see.\n\nLet me start from the end of the string and work backwards to see if I can merge the symbols into a single rule.\n\nThe last symbol is t22. Looking at the grammar, NT22 \u2192 t15 or t9, so that's a terminal. So maybe the last step is NT22 -> t22. But in the string, the last symbol is t22, which would correspond"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We have a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Our task is to determine if the string `t35 t24 t24 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t15 t4 t22 t9 t35` is generated by this grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of symbols ending with `t35`. I notice that in the grammar, there are several productions that lead to terminals like 't' or digits. So, I'll need to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back to a production that eventually leads to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me list the productions that end with a 't' or a digit, as these are the leaves in the parse tree. Each of these terminals must be generated from a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals directly produce 't' or digits:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (twice)\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT82 -> 't6'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT56 -> 't37'\n- NT11 -> 't41'\n- NT36 -> 't41'\n- NT30 -> 't55'\n- NT43 -> 't0'\n- NT89 -> 't72 t83'\nWait, actually, looking more carefully, the grammar has a lot of 't' productions, and I can see that various non-terminals directly produce these 't's or digits. \n\nNow, the string has several 't's, so I need to map each 't' in the string to a production. For example, the first 't35' at the end comes from NT72 -> 't35'. Similarly, 't24' comes from NT24, which is a terminal? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT24 isn't a non-terminal. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some rules produce 't' and digits directly. Let me list all the rules that have a 't' or a digit on the right-hand side:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't34'\n- NT2-> 't6'\n- NT6-> 't25'\n- NT15-> 't4'\n- NT72-> 't35'\n- NT82-> 't6'\n- NT5-> 't22'\n- NT10-> 't26'\n- NT80-> 't26'\n- NT56-> 't36'\n- NT56-> 't37'\n- NT11-> 't41'\n- NT36-> 't41'\n- NT30-> 't55'\n- NT43-> 't0'\n- NT66-> 't3'\n- NT27-> 't24'\n- NT22-> 't34' (repeated)\n- NT24 is not a production; perhaps it's a terminal? Wait, no, looking back, the rules have 't's and digits, so perhaps 't's and digits are terminals, and non-terminals are those with NT prefixes. Wait, actually, in the grammar, all the symbols after NT are non-terminals, and the rest are terminals.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the left-hand sides are always non-terminals because they start with 'S' or 'NT'. The right-hand sides consist of non-terminals and terminals, which are usually lowercase letters or digits, I think. So, in the given grammar, some rules produce non-terminals, others produce terminals.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that some non-terminals produce other non-terminals (like NT22 producing NT24), and others produce 't' or digits directly. For example, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'.\n\nSo, for the string, each 't' must be produced by a rule that directly outputs that 't'. Let's break down the string:\n\nt35 t24 t24 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t15 t4 t22 t9 t35\n\nSo, looking from the end:\n\nThe last symbol is 't35', which comes from NT72 -> 't35'.\n\nBefore that is 't24', which must come from NT24, but in the grammar, is there a production for NT24? Wait, no, I don't see NT24 as a non-terminal in the grammar. Let me check the productions again. \n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see any rule where NT24 is on the left-hand side. So, 't24' must be a terminal, but in the grammar, is 't24' a terminal? Or maybe it's a non-terminal that can produce 't24' directly. Wait, looking at the productions:\n\nI do see NT22 -> 't24' (twice, under 't24' in the grammar). So, 't24' can be produced by NT22. So, each 't24' in the string comes from NT22.\n\nSo, the string's last two 't35' are from NT72 and maybe another NT72? Wait, no, let's go step by step.\n\nLet's map each symbol back to its production:\n\n1. The last 't35' comes from NT72 -> 't35'.\n2. Before that, 't9' comes from NT22 -> 't9'.\n3. Then 't24' comes from NT22 -> 't24'.\n4. Another 't24' comes from NT22 -> 't24'.\n5. 't20' comes from NT89 -> 't72 t83', but wait, that's two 't's. Or perhaps another rule?\nWait, no, 't20' is a single 't', so it must come from a rule that directly produces 't20'. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that produces 't20' directly. So maybe that's a problem. Wait, no, looking at the rules, I see NT85 -> 't4' and NT43-> 't0', but 't20' isn't directly produced. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't20' is coming from NT25 or some other non-terminal that produces 't20'. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT45 isn't present (I think), but looking through, I see NT43 -> 't0' and NT85-> 't4', but I don't see a 't20' directly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's try to map each 't' symbol to a non-terminal that can produce it. Starting from the end:\n\nThe last symbol is 't35', which comes from NT72.\n\nBefore that: 't24' comes from NT22.\n\nBefore that: another 't24' comes from NT22.\n\nNext: 't20' \u2014 I don't see a direct production for 't20' in the grammar. Let me check the productions again. Looking through the grammar, I think I might have missed it. Wait, looking at NT29 \u2014 no.

Maybe 't20' can only come from a production that requires another production to generate it, but looking at the grammar, I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the string. Let me count the symbols:\n\nThe string is: t35 t24 t24 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t15 t4 t22 t9 t35. So that's 13 symbols.\n\nWait, the first 't35' is from NT72. Then 't24' is from NT22.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or a terminal can be a production on its own. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t24 t10 t36 t20 t26 t41 t15 t41 t3 t22 t34 t22`. \n\nFirst, let's parse the string into tokens to see how they sequence: t35, t24, t10, t36, t20, t26, t41, t15, t41, t3, t22, t34, t22.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use a stack-based approach or dynamic programming for parsing. But since the grammar is quite large, with many production rules, manually checking might be tedious. \n\nI should start by mapping each terminal token to its corresponding non-terminal, using the right-hand side (RHS) of the production rules. Each RHS in CNF will have exactly two non-terminals. \n\nSo, I'll go through the string from left to right, attempting to match each pair from left to right, checking if they can derive the correct combination of symbols. \n\nLet me list out the RHS mappings for each non-terminal that appears in the RHS:\n\nLooking at the production rules, I can create a dictionary mapping each non-terminal to its RHS:\n\n- S: NT9 NT52\n- NT52: NT89 NT35\n- NT84: NT28 NT8\n- NT93: NT16 NT5, NT79 NT42, NT69 NT88, NT93 NT614\n- NT69: NT85 NT52\n- NT93: multiple entries\n- And so on... It's quite extensive, so maybe I should look for the string's tokens and see which parts can be derived.\n\nWait, but the string is all terminals, so each terminal must be matched step by step. Each production in CNF leads to two non-terminals, but since all tokens in the string are terminals, that means each production used must derive directly to a terminal, which in this case, some of the non-terminals have productions that include terminals.\n\nLooking through the production rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example:\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT8 -> 't2', 't73', 't4', 't34'\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11 (which then produce 't26' and something else)\n- But wait, some of these may lead to a chain of productions to reach a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, I can approach this by building a parse tree, but it might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into pairs of two symbols each, but given that some productions require two non-terminals, each step of the derivation would produce two symbols, but in this case, the entire string must be built by taking each terminal as a production step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see that each symbol in the given string is a terminal, so each must be the result of a production. Given that, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, and so on until all symbols are terminals.\n\nBut since the string is all terminals, the derivation must have started from S, each step replacing non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven the length of the string is 13 tokens (assuming each 't' is a single token), we can check if the structure of the string allows for it to be a correct derivation.\n\nNow, let's start parsing from the beginning:\n\nFirst token: t35\n\nLooking for a production rule where RHS contains 't35'. Let's check the given RHS mappings:\n\nFrom the production steps:\n\n- NT72 -> 't35' (So, NT72 can produce t35)\n- NT11 -> 't35' (Wait, no, looking at the data, I see:\n\nWait, actually, let me find the exact production steps:\n\nFrom the grammar, specific productions are:\n\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT79 -> 't2', 't16'\n- NT95 -> 't10', 't11'  --> So, NT95's RHS is 't10' 't11', which are both terminals.\n- NT24: I need to find where 't24' comes from. Looking through, NT42 -> 't24' (from NT42: 't24'), so any production rule that includes NT42 will produce 't24'.\n\nIn our string, the third token is t36, which is an earlier symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by building the possible sequences step by step.\n\nSo, step 1: S \u2192 NT9 NT52\n\nThen, each of these NTs will need to produce their respective RHS. NT9 and NT52.\n\nLooking at the possible sequences.\n\nSo, let's see NT9:\n\nFrom the productions, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but there's also NT9\u2192 NT72 NT23. Wait, NT9's production is:\n\n- Looking through, I only see NT988 \u2192 NT21 NT9, wait wait, in the list, I see:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, for NT9:\n\nLooking at all the RHS mappings, I see NT9-> NT72 NT23, so NT9 is a non-terminal, and its RHS is NT72 and NT23.\n\nSimilarly, NT72: Let's see, looking for NT72 in the RHSS:\n\nLooking at the production rules, NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95, which may have parts leading to NT72.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be split into pairs that match the production rules of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down approach, starting with S, and trying to match the string token by token.\n\nThe grammar S \u2192 NT9 NT52\n\nSo, the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT52\n\nNow, NT9 \u2192 ? Looking at all production rules where NT9 is the LHS: Checking if any RHS has NT9:\n\nLooking through, I see that NT988: Not sure.

So, each production replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals or a single terminal. \n\nThe string we're evaluating is a sequence of terminals. To determine if it's generated by the grammar, I think we can use a parsing approach, maybe by trying to find a derivation path that builds the string. Alternatively, I can check if each terminal in the string can be matched by the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that there are a lot of rules that produce terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', and so on. Each of these terminals corresponds to certain parts of the string.\n\nLet me list the string again: t35, t6, t37, t10, t4, t4, t23, t22, t14, t24, t5, t41, t9, t35. So, the string has 14 terminals.\n\nIn a CNF grammar, the derivation tree must be a binary tree, and the number of symbols in the string (including non-terminals) must be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the height of the tree. The given string has 14 terminals. Let me see if 14+1=15 is of the form 2^n -1. 2^4 -1=15, so yes, n=4. That means the derivation tree should have a height of 4, and the number of leaves (terminals) is 14.\n\nSo, theoretically, it's possible. But let's check each terminal in the string to see if they are allowed by the grammar.\n\nLooking at each terminal in the string:\n\n- t35: Is there a production that produces t35? Yes, NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9', but none produce t35. Wait, looking back, I see NT87 \u2192 't36', NT56 \u2192 't37', and so on. Wait, checking the productions, I don't see a production that directly produces 't35'. Wait, let me recheck the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't35' directly. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me look again. Oh, under NT87: NT87 \u2192 't36' is a production, but no 't35'. Hmm, so if I don't have a production that produces 't35', maybe that's a problem.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In the provided grammar, under NT87, it's NT87 \u2192 NT56 NT30 and also NT87 \u2192 't36'. So no 't35' production. Then 't35' must come from another non-terminal that is defined through other productions. But in the string, the first token is 't35', so there's no non-terminal before it. That would mean the grammar cannot produce a terminal starting with 't35' because there's no rule that directly produces 't35'. Therefore, the string can't be generated, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look through all the production rules for terminals to see if 't35' is present.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT72 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, under NT72, there is a production NT72 \u2192 't35'. So, 't35' is produced by NT72. Now, so the first symbol in the string is 't35', which comes from NT72. Therefore, the string starts with NT72 \u2192 't35'. So, that's okay.\n\nThen the next symbol is t6, which we need to see if it's produced by some rule. Looking through, I see NT6 \u2192 't25' and NT15 \u2192 't4'. Hmm, no, wait. Let me check for t6. NT6 is a non-terminal, and the rules for NT6 are NT6 \u2192 NT15 NT22, also NT6 \u2192 't25'. So, yes, 't6' is produced by NT6 \u2192 't25'. So, that's possible.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is 't6', which would come from NT6 \u2192 't25'. So, that's fine.\n\nNow, the third symbol is 't37'. Looking at the grammar, is there a non-terminal that produces 't37'? Yes, NT56 \u2192 't37'. So, 't37' comes from NT56.\n\nThe fourth symbol is 't10'. Where does 't10' come from? Looking at the grammar, I see NT26 \u2192 't14' and 't25', but I'm looking for 't10'. Wait, looking through, I see NT55 \u2192 't20', and also NT26 \u2192 't14' and 't25', but not 't10'. Wait, 't10' comes from NT4? Let me check. Under NT4, we have rules like NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96, but no 't10' directly. Wait, perhaps 't10' comes from a different production. Looking again, under NT35: NT35 \u2192 't4', so that's not it. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's see: looking through all the terminal symbols, 't10' must come from a production rule. Checking the grammar, under NT5, there's a rule: NT5 \u2192 't35', but that's 't35', not 't10'. Hmm. Under NT55: NT55 \u2192 't20' or NT43 \u2192 't35'. Wait, maybe I missed a rule.\n\nWait, let me look again at all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nNT22: t15, t9\n\nNT73: t34\n\nNT87: t36\n\nNT72: t35\n\nNT6: t25\n\nNT15: t4\n\nNT2: t6\n\nNT13: t31\n\nNT4: t34\n\nWait, looking through, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't10'. Oh, wait, maybe I've missed a rule. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the production rules, under NT55: NT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79, and also NT55 \u2192 't20'. So, 't20' comes from NT55. That's t20.\n\nWait, but in the string, the fifth symbol is 't10' (after t37, t10). So, 't10' comes from some non-terminal. Looking at the rules, perhaps I overlooked something. Wait, under NT37, maybe? Wait, under NT10: There's a rule NT10 \u2192 NT84 NT25, but also NT10 \u2192 't26'. Wait, so 't26' comes from NT10.\n\nWait, another rule: looking at NT21, it's 't15' and 't10'. Wait, no, under NT21, it's NT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70, and also NT21 is used in some other rules. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing with another non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me approach this differently. Since the first symbol is 't35', which comes from NT72. Then the next is 't6' from NT6. So, the string is being built as NT72 \u2192 't35', and next NT6 \u2192 't6'. So, in the context of a parse tree, the root is S, which expands into NT9 NT52. But that might not be directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think about each token in the string and check if they can be generated by some non-terminal. But the issue is that the first token is 't35', which is generated by NT72. Then the next is 't6' generated by NT6, which must be the second symbol.\n\nWait, but in the string, the second symbol is 't6', which is indeed generated by NT6 \u2192 't25', so that's okay. Then the third symbol is 't37', which is generated by NT56 \u2192 't37'. So far, so good.\n\nThe fourth symbol is 't10'.

The string is `t35 t36 t20 t20 t5 t25 t41 t10 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t22`. \n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This structure is helpful because it simplifies parsing, and I can use algorithms like CYK to check if the string is in the language.\n\nSince the grammar is given in CNF and all terminal symbols are 't' followed by a digit, the string consists of these terminals. I'll need to map each terminal to its corresponding production rule to trace back the derivation.\n\nI'll start by looking at the end of the string and see if I can match any production rules ending with those terminals. For example, 't22' appears towards the end. Looking at the grammar, I see 't22' is from NT26 \u2192 NT22 (since NT22 \u2192 't22'). So, I can replace 't22' with NT26.\n\nNext, looking at the string after 't22', it's 't22', so I proceed backward. Now, looking at the structure, I also see 't26' which corresponds to NT50. So, I replace 't26' with NT50. Wait, no, 't26' is from NT50? Actually, I should check each production. From the grammar, I see 't26' is from NT80 \u2192 't26' and also NT? Wait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT50? No, looking back, the terminals are derived as follows: looking for 't26', it's from NT80 \u2192 't26' and also NT55 \u2192 't26'. Wait, no, checking the provided grammar, 't26' is from NT55 \u2192 't26'? Let me check the grammar rules. Oh, under NT22, it says NT22 \u2192 't26' is not correct. Looking at the grammar, I see 't26' is listed as a result of NT55 \u2192 't26' and NT80 \u2192 't26'. So, 't26' can come from multiple NTs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the terminal productions first because that's crucial. The terminal productions are:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't26'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14'\n- NT49 \u2192 't8'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT86 \u2192 't34'\n- NT14 \u2192 't23'\n- NT39 \u2192 't22'\n- NT73 \u2192 't34'\n- NT87 \u2192 't36'\n- NT14 \u2192 't8'\n- NT16 \u2192 't37'\n- NT12 \u2192 't10'\n- NT87 \u2192 't31'\n- NT28 \u2192 't10'\n- NT39 \u2192 't8'\n- NT96 \u2192 't22'\n- NT11 \u2192 't41'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT55 \u2192 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't34'\n- NT88 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n- NT63 \u2192 't32'\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, we can note which NTs produce them. So, the string is `t35 t36 t20 t20 t5 t25 t41 t10 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t22`.\n\nLet me process the string from right to left or perhaps build the derivation step by step.\n\nStarting from the end, the last symbol is 't22'. From the grammar, 't22' is from NT26 \u2192 't22' because in the rules, NT22 \u2192 't22'? Wait, no. Looking again, under NT22, it's listed as NT22 \u2192 't36'? Wait, wait. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSo, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. Wait, but 't22' is not directly a result of any NT rule? Or am I missing something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking back, under NT22, it says:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo, 't22' is not directly produced by any rule. That doesn't make sense because in the string, we have 't22' as the last symbol. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a rule where an NT leads to 't22'. Let me look again.\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, under NT87: NT87 \u2192 NT14 NT5 and under NT86: NT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27. Not directly. Under NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23.\n\nWait, maybe I overlooked some rules. Let me scan through all the production rules for NTs ending with 't' symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps 't22' is part of a larger NT rule. For example, looking for any rule where an NT produces a terminal. Oh, no, in the grammar provided, all NT rules are of the form NTXY \u2192 NTAB, except for certain NTs that have a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for any NT that directly produces 't22' or any terminal with 't' and numbers.\n\nAh, looking at the list:\n\n- NT80 \u2192 't26'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT49 \u2192 't8'\n- NT13 \u2192 't31'\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n- NT86 \u2192 't34'\n- NT14 \u2192 't23'\n- NT39 \u2192 't22'\n- NT73 \u2192 't34'\n- NT87 \u2192 't36'\n- NT14 \u2192 't8'\n- NT16 \u2192 't37'\n- NT12 \u2192 't10'\n- NT87 \u2192 't31'\n- NT28 \u2192 't10'\n- NT39 \u2192 't8'\n- NT96 \u2192 't22'\n- NT11 \u2192 't41'\n- NT5 \u2192 't22'\n- NT55 \u2192 't35'\n- NT13 \u2192 't4'\n- NT4 \u2192 't34'\n- NT88 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n- NT63 \u2192 't32'\n\nWait, I see now that 't22' comes from two NTs: NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, but that's not it. Oh, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11. So that's two NT symbols. That's a production rule, but it doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nWait, but I see that NT5 \u2192 't22' (multiple times):\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are multiple rules where NT5 produces 't22':\n\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- Also, looking back, I see:\n\nNT56 \u2192 't36' comes from rules where NT56 \u2192 NT35 NT20, but that's a two-step.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for NT5, let's see:\n\n- NT88 \u2192 't5'\n- NT25 \u2192 't25'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n\nHmm, I don't see any rule where NT5 directly produces 't22'.

{"custom_id":"request-244","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the right side. That should make parsing or generating strings a bit straightforward, maybe using algorithms like CYK or recursive descent. But since I'm just trying to figure out if a specific string is in the language, perhaps I can approach it by tracing the string back through the grammar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t24 t10 t37 t8 t37 t24 t12 t34 t22 t41 t3 t35 t15 t35`.\n\nWait, but the grammar's start symbol is S, so the entire string should be derived from S. Let's check how S can expand. The start symbol S has the production S -> NT9 NT5. So the string should start with NT9 and be followed by NT5. But looking at the string, the first token is t35, which is an terminal, so how does that fit in?\n\nLooking back, in the grammar, NT9 can produce NT72 NT23 and NT9. Let's see where t35 comes from. Wait, in the right-hand side of the productions, there are some rules that turn certain non-terminals into terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't25', NT8 -> 't2', etc.\n\nLet me try to see if t35 is a terminal. Checking the list of productions, yes, NT6 -> 't25', but wait, what about NT35? Looking for NT35, it's present as a non-terminal, but does it produce a terminal? Let's check.\n\nLooking into the grammar: NT35 has a production rule NT35 -> NT42 NT87 and NT35 -> NT15 NT69. But those are both non-terminals. Wait, there are entries where NT69 -> NT85 NT52, and NT52 has several productions. Maybe I'm missing something. Actually, looking through the rules, I don't see NT35 producing a terminal directly. So perhaps t35 is part of some non-terminal that does, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the grammar. The NT tokens are on the left side, and the production rules expand them into other NT tokens or sometimes 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo, for example, NT42 -> NT12 NT56, which might eventually lead to a terminal. Let's take the first token 't35' in the string. Which NT rule produces 't35'?\n\nLooking through all the 't' rules:\n\n- NT36 -> t41 (but 41 isn't 35)\n- NT22 -> t15 (no)\n- NT36 -> t27 (no)\n- NT24 -> appears as a terminal in NT42: NT42 -> t24\n- NT35 is never on the right side of a rule leading to 't'... Wait, wait, there's a line: NT66 -> t3. Hmm. So t35 isn't present as a terminal. That's a problem. If the string contains t35, but all the terminal rules are t24, t10, etc., and I don't see t35 as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let's check the grammar rules carefully. The list includes a bunch of lines where NT production rules lead to 't' followed by a number:\n\nLooking through all the given rules, the only 't's are:\n\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT28 -> 't15'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT40 -> I don't see, wait no, looking at the list: there's NT14 -> t23, but others like NT4 have 't25', etc.\n\nWait, none of these produce t35. So if the string contains t35, but none of the NT rules produce it, then that string cannot be generated by the given grammar. Therefore, the answer should be No.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed a 't35' somewhere? Looking through the list again:\n\n- NT66 -> 't3' \u2192 t3\n- NT27 -> 't24' \u2192 t24\n- NT80 -> 't26' \u2192 t26\n- NT44 \u2192 No, not present. Wait, the grammar doesn't have a rule that produces t35. So any 't35' in the string would require a non-terminal that produces it, which doesn't exist.\n\nSo, that means the string contains a term that can't be derived from the grammar, making it impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar provided. It looks like each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and expands into two non-terminals on the right, except for some that directly go to terminals (like 't*' or numbers). So this is Chomsky Normal Form, which is a good start because it's structured, but might mean each step in the derivation is straightforward.\n\nThe string to check starts with `t35`, which seems to be a terminal. So the grammar must have a production that directly leads to t35. Looking through the list, for example, NT83 -> t22 t34, and NT56 -> t37 which might not help here. Wait, wait, let me go through the productions more carefully.\n\nLooking for 't35', I see NT83 -> t22 t34 and NT34 -> something? Wait, no, looking through the list, under NT70, NT78, NT82, etc. Wait, actually, the terminals are directly given. Let me find all the production rules that end with a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to start from the string and try to reverse-engineer how it could be derived. So, each 't35' must come from a specific production.\n\nWait, I'll list out all the terminal symbols in the string: t35, t6, t24, t24, t8, t24, t5, t12, t34, t34, t31, t10, t36, t15, t22.\n\nNow, I need to see if these terminals can appear in the leftmost derivations of the grammar.\n\nStarting from S. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the production S -> NT9 NT52. So S starts as NT9 and NT52. Then, each of these can be further expanded.\n\nLet me see if I can trace each step. But this might take a while. Maybe instead, I'll try to find if there's a leftmost derivation path that can produce this string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string by matching the leftmost non-terminal steps. But since this is a tree structure, it's probably easier to simulate the derivation step by step.\n\nWait, another approach: Each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except when the production directly goes to terminals, which are like A \u2192 a where a is a terminal symbol. So the string must be a concatenation of such productions from the start symbol.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, which must be the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nLet me try to map this.\n\nThe first symbol is t35. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t35.\n\nLooking through the productions, any NT that directly goes to 't35'? Looking through the list, I see:\n\nLooking through the given productions:\n\n- NT83 -> t22 t34\n- NT10 -> t26\n- NT22 -> t15, t9, t10, t22, etc.\nWait, looking for NT -> 't35'. Hmm, I can't see any NT directly going to t35. Maybe I'm missing it. Wait, the 'terminals' are given at the bottom:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't10', 't34'.... Wait, perhaps I need to check each production carefully.\n\nLooking through the bottom:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't10', 't34'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the bottom of the grammar, the productions are broken into two parts: some are A->BC, others are A-> 't*'.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reorganize the grammar. It seems the grammar is a list of productions, some splitting into two non-terminals, and others ending with a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT66 -> 't3' NT66?\nWait, looking at the given productions, it's a mix of both. Let me note which ones are productions to terminals:\n\nLooking through the end:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT55 -> 't20'\nNT80 -> 't26'\nNT56 -> 't36'\nNT10 -> 't26'\nNT72 -> 't35'\nNT78 -> 't40'\nNT6 -> 't25'\nNT15 -> 't4'\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT66 -> 't3'\nNT22 -> 't34'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT84 -> 't5'\nNT85 -> 't4'\nNT28 -> 't10'\nNT39 -> 't22'\nNT73 -> 't34'\nNT87 -> 't36'\nNT14 -> 't23'\nNT39 -> 't8'\nNT16 -> 't37'\nNT12 -> 't10'\nNT87 -> 't31'\nNT28 -> 't10'\nNT39 -> 't8'\nNT96 -> 't22'\nNT11 -> 't41'\nNT5 -> 't22'\nNT55 -> 't35'\nNT13 -> 't4'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT88 -> 't5'\nNT25 -> 't25'\nNT42 -> 't24'\nNT63 -> 't32'\n\nSo, the productions that directly output terminals are:\n\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't10', 't34'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT84 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT39 -> 't22', 't8'\n- NT73 -> 't34'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT14 -> 't23'\n- NT96 -> 't22'\n- NT11 -> 't41'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT55 -> 't35'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't35'. So in the derivation, the last symbol generated must come from a production where NT produces 't35'.\n\nLooking at the list, NT72 -> t35 (if there were such a production). Wait, no. Wait, in the given productions, I see NT4 -> t35, NT72 -> t35, and NT55 -> t35 as well.\n\nSo possible options for 't35' are from NT4, NT55, or NT72.\n\nWait, NT72 is a terminal 't35', yes.\n\nSo the first step is to start with S and derive t35 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, S is NT9 and NT52, so the S string starts with NT9 and NT52. Let's assume we start by expanding NT9 and NT52.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t35, which comes from either NT4, NT55, or NT72. Let's see which of these could be derived from S.\n\nLooking at the left-hand side, the first symbol is t35, meaning the first expansion must lead to t35 somewhere deep in the derivation. Alternatively, perhaps S directly expands into NT9 and NT52, and NT9 could eventually produce t35.\n\nLet me check the possible derivations.\n\nLet's try to think recursively. The string is a sequence of t35, t6, t24, t24, t8, t24, t5, t12, t34, t34, t31, t10, t36, t15, t22.\n\nWe need to see if S can derive this string by a series of leftmost expansions.\n\nLet me note that each symbol in the string must be generated by a production. Since the first symbol is t35, which is a terminal, we must have a production leading to t35.\n\nSo the last node in the parse tree for t35 must be using a production like NT4 \u2192 t35, NT55\u2192t35, or NT72\u2192t35.\n\nBut looking at the start symbol S, it"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is a sequence of t followed by numbers, like t35 t36 t20 and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars, we produce strings by starting from the start symbol and rewriting symbols until we get all terminals. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each rule either produces two terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, S, the first rule is S -> NT9 NT5. So, every expansion starts with NT9 and NT5. But wait, NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals, right? I need to see how they can be rewritten.\n\nLooking at NT9's rules, I see that NT93 is one of them. Wait, NT9 itself isn't listed as a terminal. Oh, actually, in the grammar, some NTs directly go into terminals like 't' followed by a number. So, when a non-terminal is rewritten, it must be replaced by either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but NT9 isn't terminal, it must be expanded into something else. Looking through the rules, I see that NT95 has a rule that goes to NT10 NT11, and other NTs that eventually lead to terminals. But I'm getting confused because in the string, the first token is t35.

Wait, let me check:\n\nOh, looking at the rules, some NTs immediately go to terminals. For instance, NT27 -> 't24', NT22 -> 't15' and 't9', NT25 -> 't25'?

Maybe NT95 isn't the right path.\n\nAnother approach: see if any of the later nodes in the parse tree can produce t35 directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should see what each t in the string can correspond to and work backward.\n\nBut perhaps I'm getting stuck because it's difficult without the full parse tree. Let me think differently: perhaps the string is valid if it can be produced by S through some sequence of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to check if the string can be generated by following the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the given grammar, the start symbol is S, which must produce NT9 NT5. So, each step starts with that.\n\nBut without further rules, maybe it's impossible to generate t35 as the first token, which suggests the string can't be generated. But I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing some rules.

{"custom_id":"request-269","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem. I've got a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF), and I need to check if the given string `t35 t6 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t37 t35 t15 t23 t22 t31 t24 t15 t35` is generated by this grammar. The approach I'll take is to reverse-engineer the derivation sequence from the start symbol S down to the string, matching each terminal step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a non-terminal and a terminal. However, the given grammar has some rules with terminals in the productions, like `NT22 -> 't24'`. So, I'll start from the top of the grammar, which is S -> NT9 NT5, and try to match each part of the string.\n\nLet's break down the string into segments corresponding to the non-terminals. The string starts with `t35`, which appears in `NT8->NT78 NT28`, but `t35` also appears in `NT72-> t35`. Wait, looking back, let me check. Oh, no, looking at the rules, I see `NT6-> t25`, `NT15->t4`... Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this step by step.\n\n1. **Starting Rule S -> NT9 NT5**:\n   - The first symbol in the string is `t35`. Looking for rules where `t35` is a terminal. From the grammar, `NT6-> t25`, `NT4-> t35`, etc. So, perhaps NT9 is responsible for generating `t35`.\n   - Looking at NT9, the rule is `NT9-> NT72 NT23`. But in the grammar, `NT72-> t35`. So, NT9 in the rule would eventually produce `t35` as a terminal.\n   - Next, the second non-terminal is NT5. The string's second symbol is `t6`. From the grammar, `NT6-> t25`, but `t6` also appears in `NT22->t6`... Wait, no, looking again, `NT0-> NT70 NT80`, but that's `t26`. Hmm, maybe I need to find a rule for NT5 that produces `t6`.\n   - Wait, in the rules, I see `NT26->t15` and `NT26->t16`, but maybe I'm getting sidetracked. Let me check NT5 in the rules. There's `NT52->NT60 NT81`, `NT52-> NT81 NT83`... Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing a direct path. Alternatively, perhaps NT5 can derive `t6` through a different production. Wait, looking for a rule where NT5 is on the left side. I see `NT4-> NT83 NT96`, `NT9->NT72 NT23`, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm going about this wrong. Maybe it's better to consider that each step should produce part of the string, matching from the start.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll parse the string backward, seeing if it can be generated starting from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but actually, the usual approach is to start from S and try to generate the string by expanding non-terminals into terminals and other non-terminals step by step, matching the string as we go.\n\nLet me consider the string: `t35 t6 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t37 t35 t15 t23 t22 t31 t24 t15 t35`. Let's see how this can be broken into parts.\n\nLooking for possible NT9 and NT5:\n\n1. The string starts with `t35`. From the grammar, `NT9` can derive to `NT72 NT23`. `NT72-> t35`, so that would consume `t35` and then leave `t6` next. Then, the second part is `t6`. Looking for NT5, which should generate `t6` next. Wait, looking at NT5's rules, I'm not immediately seeing `t6`, so perhaps NT5 can split into other non-terminals that derive into `t6`.\n\nWait, maybe I should list the rules where each NT leads to a terminal:\n\n- `NT22 -> 't24'`\n- `NT22 -> 't15'`\n- `NT22 -> 't9'`\n- `NT80 -> 't26'`\n- `NT55 -> 't20'`\n- `NT88 -> 't5'`\n- `NT42 -> 't24'`\n- `NT63 -> 't32'`\n- `NT15->'t4'`\n- `NT10->'t26'`\n- `NT56->'t36'`\n- `NT95->'t10'`\n- `NT70->'t78'`\n- `NT72->'t35'`\n- `NT68->'t20'`\n- `NT26->'t16'`\n- `NT26->'t15'`\n- `NT80->'t26'`\n- `NT52->'t81'` (from 52 -> 60 81, but I need to see where 81 goes)\nWait, perhaps I should look for each NT and see which rules produce which terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps for NT9, possible rules are:\n\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n- NT23 is a non-terminal. Let me see: NT23-> NT93 NT22, etc. This could get complicated.\n\nMaybe it's better to consider each step and see which non-terminals can produce each part of the string.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals until we consume the entire string.\n\nLet me start:\n\n1. The first two non-terminals are NT9 and NT5. From S -> NT9 NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9 and NT5:\n\nLooking for a production of NT9 that leads to a terminal and then NT5 to another terminal, etc., until all symbols are consumed.\n\nWait, the string starts with `t35`. So let's see if NT9 can derive to 't35' first.\n\nFrom NT9->NT72 NT23. Now, NT72-> 't35', so that would consume the first 't35'. Then, NT23 needs to produce the next terminal.\n\nThe next symbol is `t6`, so NT23 must produce 't6'. Let's see:\n\nNT23 -> NT93 NT22 (from the grammar). Now, NT93 has multiple rules. Let's see if any of them produce 't6':\n\nLooking at NT93 rules:\n\n- NT93->NT6 NT14 (from NT93 in the rules: NT93-> NT6 NT14). Wait, but in the grammar given, is that NT93 production correct? Let me check the provided rules:\n\nLooking back, the rules include:\n\nNT93-> NT16 NT5\nNT69-> NT88 NT26\nNT93-> NT79 NT42\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. In the grammar provided, the entries under NT39 include NT39 -> NT22 NT8... Wait, perhaps I should list out all the NT93 rules properly.\n\nWait, let's collect all the production rules for each NT:\n\nNT22 has rules: NT22->'t24', 't15', 't9'\n\nNT26: NT26->t16, t15\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for NT6 in the rules.\n\nWait, NT6->t25. But that's not directly in the string. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree in reverse, starting from the end of the string and checking if it can be generated by the grammar.\n\nReverse Approach:\n\nThe idea is to start from the end of the string and work backward, replacing each terminal with the corresponding production rule.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Start with the end string: t35 t6 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t37 t35 t15 t23 t22 t31 t24 t15 t35.\n\n2. Look for the last symbol: t35. Which NT rules produce t35?\n\nFrom the grammar, looking at each non-terminal:\n\nNT72->t35.\n\nSo, the last symbol t35 must come from NT72. So we replace t35 with NT72.\n\nNow the string becomes: t35 t6 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t37 t35 t15 t23 t2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-288","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, or a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production has two symbols, so the derivation process is straightforward\u2014each step reduces a non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nThe string we're checking is: `t35 t6 t24 t10 t41 t5 t25 t41 t40 t10 t24 t34 t24 t3 t24 t34 t22`.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the possible production rules from the grammar. Most of the non-terminals become two symbols, some directly give terminals, like `NT2 -> t6`, but others are more complex.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of `t` followed by numbers. Each `tX` seems to correspond to a terminal production. So, each `tX` is a terminal, and we can check if the string can be derived by the given rules.\n\nSince the string has 17 tokens, which is 17 symbols, I need to check if there's a way to reduce the start symbol S to this sequence of terminals through a series of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces two non-terminals: `NT9` and `NT5`. Each of these non-terminals will need to produce a sequence of symbols that eventually result in the `t35` at the beginning of the string.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe string starts with `t35`. Let's look at which non-terminals produce `t35`. Looking at the rules, several seem to have `t35`:\n\n- NT22 -> t15\n- NT26 -> t14\n- NT4 -> t35\n- NT55 -> t43\n- NT5 -> t22\n- NT16 -> t37\n- NT12 -> t10\n- NT14 -> t23\n- NT20 -> Not in the list.\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, only NT4 produces t35:\n\nLooking back, the rules are:\n\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT6 -> t25\n- NT15 -> t4\n- NT2 -> t6\n- NT66 -> t3\n- NT22 -> t34\n- NT4 -> t35\n- So yes, NT4 can produce t35.\n\nSo, the first symbol is t35, which comes from NT4. So, one of the productions that NT4 has must lead to t35. Let me check the grammar rules for NT4:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n- NT4 -> NT96 NT25\nWait, that seems off. Let me recheck:\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\nWait, is that correct? Or am I mixing up the rules? Let me scan the list:\n\nYes, the rules for NT4 are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n- NT4 -> NT96 NT25\n\nHmm, so NT4 can produce NT83 NT96, NT25 NT63, or NT96 NT25. None of these directly produce t35, but perhaps through further productions.\n\nSince t35 comes directly from NT4, which has a production that can lead to a pair of NTs that can then produce t35. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if NT4 produces a pair of NTs, then to get t35 directly, one of those NTs must produce t35. But let's look at the productions for ND4:\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nLooking again, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me scan the grammar for NT4 and NT25 and NT63.\n\nThe rules mentioned are:\n\n- NT2 -> t6\n- NT39 -> t22\n- NT39 -> t8\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n- NT4 -> NT96 NT25\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT6 -> t25\n- NT15 -> t4\n- NT22 -> t34\n- So, NT4's productions are:\n\n1. NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n2. NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n3. NT4 -> NT96 NT25\n\nNone of these directly produce t35, so to have the first symbol be t35, it must come from a non-terminal that can directly produce t35. Looking through the rules, I only see NT4 producing t35 via one of its productions indirectly.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me make sure. Let me re-examine the grammar. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Looking again, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> t35. Hmm, no, looking back, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n\nSo, I don't see a production where NT4 directly produces t35. So, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Then how can the first symbol be t35? Because t35 must be produced by a non-terminal that has a production to t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I've missed a rule. Let me scan again. scrolling down:\n\nWait, looking at the end of the list, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> t34\n- NT4 -> t35\nWait, no, maybe I'm missing it. Hmm, looking back through the rules:\n\nWait, actually, I think I made an error. Let me list all the rules again to check.\n\nLooking through the entire list:\n\nWait, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n- NT4 -> NT96 NT25\n- Other rules for other NTs.\n\nWait, then where does t35 come from? Because the string starts with t35, which must come from some NT that has a production directly to t35. But according to the rules, there is no rule where NTx -> t35 directly. So perhaps this string is not possible because there's no way to produce t35.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake and missed a production. Let me recheck the entire grammar.\n\nLooking through:\n\nYes, I see some NTs that produce t6, t15, etc., but I don't see any NT directly producing t35. That's a problem because if the first symbol is t35 and there's no production for NTx -> t35, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string is given as a test. Maybe I checked incorrectly. Let me go through the entire list of rules again.\n\nLooking at NT15:\n\n- NT15 -> NT27 NT60\n- NT15 -> NT78 NT28\n- ... etc. No t35.\n\nNT4:\n\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT4 -> NT25 NT63\n- NT4 -> NT96 NT25\n\nNo t35.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo and another NT produces it, but according to the rules provided, there's no NT that directly produces t35.

{"custom_id":"request-283","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string given is `t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t24 t10 t37 t6 t12 t34 t34 t4 t8 t34 t22`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. The grammar has a start symbol S, which produces NT9 NT5. Then, each of those symbols can produce other combinations, eventually leading to terminals (like 't's) according to the productions.\n\nI see that each production is of the form A -> BC, which fits CNF. So, the grammar is structured such that each non-terminal expands into two others until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of a sequence of 't's with numbers. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar. \n\nI think the best approach is to work backwards, using the CYK algorithm or similar method to parse the string. But since I'm more familiar with the CYK approach, I'll try that.\n\nFirst, I need to note the variables and terminals. The terminals in the grammar are 't's followed by a number. So, the string has terms like t35, t36, etc., which are terminals, and the non-terminals are the NT followed by numbers, like NT9, NT5, etc.\n\nThe initial step is to check if the entire string is in the language, meaning all symbols (except maybe the start symbol) are terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: each token is t followed by a number, which is a terminal. So, S needs to produce a sequence that can break down into these terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. So, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. \n\nNext, NT9 and NT5 each produce two NTs according to the grammar rules. So, I need to trace how these nt's can expand into the string.\n\nI think the best way is to list all the possible productions for each non-terminal and see how they can combine to form the string.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider parsing from the beginning. The string is `t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t24 t10 t37 t6 t12 t34 t34 t4 t8 t34 t22`.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, and each step combines two into one.\n\nTo apply the CYK algorithm, I need to construct a table where cells represent the possible non-terminals that can derive the substring from that row to that column.\n\nBut since this might be time-consuming, maybe I can look for the production that could generate each part.\n\nStart by checking if the first token t35 can be derived from any NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT73 generates t34. But wait, looking more carefully, I see that NT73 \u2192 't34'. So, if NT73 is present, it can generate 't34'.\n\nLooking at the initial production, S is NT9 NT5. So, I need to see if NT9 can generate t35 or break down into other non-terminals that can then produce t35.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, I don't see NT9 directly producing t35. Instead, NT9's production is NT70 NT6. So, NT9 \u2192 NT70 NT6.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT70 and NT6 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52. So, NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52.\n\nNow, looking at NT82, it's NT82 \u2192 NT49 NT9. So, NT82 \u2192 NT49 NT9.\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT8 NT34. So, NT49 \u2192 NT8 NT34.\n\nNT8 \u2192 t2. NT34 \u2192 t34.\n\nWait, but this seems a bit long. Let me see if that's a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach step by step.\n\nThe string starts with t35, t36, t35, etc. So, I need to see if each t corresponds to a non-terminal's production.\n\nLooking for where a production leads to a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 t22 from one of the productions. Wait, looking at NT4: NT4 \u2192 t35. Oh, I see, NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96, and NT83 \u2192 t22, NT96 \u2192 t22. So, NT4 can produce t22. But wait, another production for NT4 is NT66 \u2192 t3, etc.\n\nAlternatively, looking for t35, I see that NT73 \u2192 t34. But no NT produces t35 directly. So, perhaps this is an issue.\n\nWait, let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking through the productions, none of the NTs directly produce t35 except perhaps through multiple steps. Looking for any NT that can produce a direct t35.\n\nLooking at all productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't6', which is a terminal.\n\nLooking for 't35':\n\n- NT42 \u2192 t24, which is a terminal.\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t40, a terminal.\n\nLooking for a production that results in t35. From the productions, I see NT73 \u2192 t34, but nothing directly gives t35. Hmm. So, perhaps the string includes t35, which requires a non-terminal that can produce t35 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking through all the productions for NTs:\n\nI think I see that NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8. NT28 \u2192 t10. NT66 \u2192 t3. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's list all the NTs and their productions to see if any can reach t35, t36, etc.\n\nLooking for NT35:\n\n- Are there any NTs that directly produce a t35?\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT directly producing t35 as a terminal.

Similarly, NT86 \u2192 t34, etc.\n\nBut I don't see any NT that directly produces a t35 or t36.\n\nWait, actually, looking again, I see that:\n\nNT62 \u2192 \"t36\". Wait, but in the list, I don't see that. Wait, perhaps NT84 \u2192 t5. Looking again, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the NTs.

I'm getting confused. Let's try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is t35, t36, t35, t40, t10, t26, t24, t10, t37, t6, t12, t34, t34, t4, t8, t34, t22.\n\nEach of these is a terminal. So, I need to see if there's a way to produce the entire string starting from S and breaking down into these terms.\n\nSince S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which expands further.\n\nEach step involves combining two non-terminals into another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be broken down into a sequence of non-terminals that can derive each of these steps.\n\nAlternatively, let's check if the grammar includes any production that can lead to t35 or t36.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nLooking for 't35' as a terminal symbol.\n\nIn the productions, I don't see any NT directly producing t35.

The string is `t35 t6 t24 t24 t8 t35 t25 t8 t9 t24 t12 t34 t22 t41 t4 t24 t9 t35`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that a CFG in CNF has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Also, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal. This structure is helpful because it allows for efficient parsing and can be analyzed using methods like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is relatively small, maybe a manual approach would work.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I can see a bunch of production rules. The left-hand sides (LHS) are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides (RHS) are combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. Each production has either two non-terminals or one terminal on the RHS.\n\nThe string starts with `t35`, which is a terminal. So I need to find a production rule that starts with `t35`. Looking at the grammar, the production `NT78 \u2192 t40 NT6` isn't that, but wait, no, the terminals are directly the t's. Let me check each production that starts with a terminal to see which ones produce `t35`.\n\nLooking at the production rules, I see that NT93 \u2192 NT69 NT52; no, wait, I should look for rules where the RHS is a terminal. Wait no, in CNF, the RHS can be two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. Oh wait, no, in CNF, the productions are strictly A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, meaning two symbols on the RHS. But I'm looking for terminals, so maybe I should check which productions result in terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should check each terminal token in the string and see if it's the terminal of any production. For example, `t35` appears in some productions. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- `NT78 \u2192 t8 NT28`: so when NT78 is expanded, it can produce `t8 NT28`.\n- `NT55 \u2192 t43 NT22`: but `t43` isn't in the string, so perhaps not relevant right now.\nWait, no, perhaps I need to look for rules that result in the terminals in the string. Let me check where the terminal `t35` appears in the RHS of productions:\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see any production where the RHS is just `t35`. Instead, I see that `t35` is part of RHS in some rules. For example:\n\n- `NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8`: no t's here.\n- `NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23`: no t's.\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to check production rules that have `t35` in their RHS.\n\nWait, let me look again. For example, the production NT22 \u2192 't15' and 't9'. So NT22 can produce `t15` or `t9`. But I don't see where `t35` is a direct terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking at the grammar again, I see that NT78 \u2192 t8 NT28 and NT82 \u2192 t49 NT9. These don't help.

The string is `t35 t6 t24 t10 t36 t8 t35 t37 t35 t34 t4 t9 t22 t41 t4 t24 t34 t22`. \n\nFirst, I know that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, all the productions either have two non-terminals or end with a terminal. So, that's good because when we parse the string, each symbol should correspond to a production that eventually reduces to a terminal string.\n\nThe string starts with `t35`, which I assume is a terminal. So, I need to find a production that results in `t35`. Looking at the grammar, I see `NT35 -> NT42 NT87` and other productions starting with NT35. Wait, but none of the productions for NT35 directly go to a terminal. So maybe there's a longer path.\n\nWait, let me scan the grammar again. I see that some non-terminals like NT22 produce 't24', and others produce 't22' or 't15' or other 't' terms. I need to see how the start symbol S generates the string.\n\nStarting with S, the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the first step is to split the string into parts that might correspond to NT9 and NT5. But the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see how this parses.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. Each grammar rule splits the string into left and right parts, which correspond to the left and right sub-structures. So, for example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5 means the string must start with whatever NT9 produces and end with whatever NT5 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is `t35`. So, I need to find which NT production leads to `t35`. Let me look at the grammar for NT35. I don't see any direct NT35 \u2192 t35. Hmm. Wait, actually, wait a second. Let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43, NT35 \u2192 ... Let me check NT35: I don't see any production that directly results in t35. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT terminals.\n\nWait, no, looking through, I don't see any NT term producing 't35' directly except maybe in the higher levels. So perhaps I need to build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire grammar can be transformed into a series of terminals, and the string is a concatenation of those. So, perhaps I can count the number of terminals and see if it's a valid number.\n\nWait, the string has 19 symbols. Since S starts with two non-terminals, each of those can generate multiple symbols. The number of symbols can be calculated based on the grammar.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Instead, I'll try to parse the string step by step.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list: ['t35', 't6', 't24', 't10', 't36', 't8', 't35', 't37', 't35', 't34', 't4', 't9', 't22', 't41', 't4', 't24', 't34', 't22']\n\nLooking at the first symbol 't35'. So, I need to find a production for NT35 that gives 't35'. Wait, let me look through the grammar again. I don't see any NT35 \u2192 t*. But maybe it's derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, let's see NT35 is involved in several productions, but I don't see any that produce a terminal. For example, NT35 can go to NT42 NT87, which in turn have their own productions. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 \u2192 't25' but that's not 't35'. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's see if any NT productions lead to 't35'. Let me check each NT production that could end in t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT21 \u2192 't15' etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking for any NT that has a direct production to t35.\n\nWait, I see that NT35 is part of some rules but not producing a terminal. Let me check if any other NT produces 't35'.\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, etc.\n\nI don't see any NT that directly goes to t35. So maybe the initial NT9 or NT5 must produce t35.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the entire string must be the concatenation of the results of NT9 and NT5.\n\nSo, the first part is from NT9, leading to 't35', and the second part is from NT5 leading to the rest.\n\nWait, let me see. Let's see what NT9 produces. NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, and so on. Maybe that's a long chain.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for the first few symbols.\n\nWe start with t35. So, let's consider the production leading to t35.\n\nLooking for any NT production that can derive t35. Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check all the NTs:\n\nLooking through, the NTs that have terminals:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT34 \u2192 't34'?\nWait, wait, no. Let me look at all the terminals:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 't16'\n- NT24 \u2192 't24'\n- NT26 \u2192 't23'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' etc.\nWait, no 't35' directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the production is via other NTs. Let's see:\n\nWait, is there any NT that can produce t35?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through, none of the NTs directly produce 't35'. So maybe the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol is t35, but the grammar doesn't have any production that starts a substring ending with t35.\n\nWait, but the entire production S \u2192 NT9 NT5 must result in the string. So, the entire string must be a combination of the derivations of NT9 and NT5.\n\nBut if the first symbol is t35, then that must come from either NT9 or NT5. Since S produces NT9 followed by NT5, perhaps t35 is from NT9.\n\nBut if NT9 cannot produce t35, or if there's no way NT9 can lead to t35, then the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but I don't see any production that produces t35. Let me check all the NTs:\n\nWait, looking through again, I realize that NT24 \u2192 t24, but I don't see any NT producing t35.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each NT:\n\nLooking for any NT with a direct production to t35:\n\n- NT24 \u2192 t24\n- NT23 \u2192 t15? No, that's not t35.\n- NT22 \u2192 t24? No.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule.

I see a bunch of production rules for non-terminals (like S, NT5, NT6, etc.) that each break down into two other non-terminals. All the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals which appear at the end of the string. Each production seems to have two parts, each being another production or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the string, each part is either a non-terminal like t35, t24, etc. or a terminal which is a single character like 't'. Wait, no, actually, in context-free grammars, each symbol can be a terminal or a non-terminal, but in the string, each element is separated by spaces, so each part is a single terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of terminals, none of which are non-terminals. Hmm, because in the grammar all the non-terminals are things like NT5, NT6, etc., with the only terminals being the 'tX' strings or letters like 't', '2', '5', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, the NT rules are all of the form NTxxx \u2192 other NT rules or terminals? Wait, looking more closely, the grammar has rules where the left side is an NT followed by numbers, like S -> NT9 NT5. And the right side is two NT rules concatenated. So every step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. The rules ultimately resolve down to terminals, which are things like 't1', 't2', etc., or perhaps 't35', 't4', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I notice that some rules directly resolve to a terminal. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', and so on. So each time a rule is applied, it can either replace a non-terminal with two other non-terminals or eventually produce a terminal symbol.\n\nBut in the string, every element is a single-terminal symbol like 't35', 't24', etc. So for the string to be generated, it must be that every step in the derivation ends up with a string that is exactly this sequence of terminals, without any non-terminals left.\n\nLet me outline the approach. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form (each production is a non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals or a terminal), I can model the derivation as a tree, starting from S and breaking down each symbol step by step until I reach terminals.\n\nBut this might be complicated because the string is long. Maybe I can simplify by checking if the string can be generated by the grammar by reverse engineering, ensuring that each terminal in the string can be reached through the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string can be fully expanded into S, respecting the production rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the string and breaking it into its components. The string is: t35 t24 t10 t24 t31 t36 t34 t25 t24 t5 t41 t20 t26 t41 t15 t4 t22 t9 t35.\n\nThat's 19 terminals. Each step of the derivation will break down a non-terminal into two parts. Starting with the top-level string S (from the first production S\u2192NT9 NT5), which would produce two terminals after full expansion.\n\nWait, but S is NT9 and NT5. So in the string, the first two elements must correspond to the expansions of NT9 and NT5. Let me check the string: the first element is t35, and the second is t24. So for NT9, it should expand to t35 and t24... wait, no, actually, NT9's expansion is through its production rules.\n\nLooking at the NT9 rules, for example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, but I see more in the grammar like NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, etc. Wait, actually, looking back, the grammar includes rules for NT95, NT93, etc. I think I need to look at all the NT rules and see which ones can produce t35 and t24.\n\nWait, first, let's check the productions for NT9: \n\nWait, in the given grammar, the NT rules are as follows:\n\nLooking through, I see NT93 has several productions:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n\nAnd so on. \n\nSimilarly, NT24 would be a terminal, which is one of the 'tX' symbols in the string.\n\nWait, I'm confused. The grammar seems to have non-terminals like NT52, NT84, etc., but also terminals like t35, t24, etc. Wait, actually, perhaps the symbols like t35 are terminals, while others are non-terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, the rules are all of the form NTxxx \u2192 NTyyyy NTzzzz, and some of these non-terminals eventually produce a terminal symbol, such as 't15', 't24', etc.\n\nSo the steps are: starting from S, which is NT9 and NT5. Each of these NTs will be expanded until they produce terminals.\n\nSo the string starts with t35 and t24. So S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and NT9 must expand to t35 and something, while NT5 must expand to t24 and something else. Let's check the possible expansions.\n\nLooking at NT9, we can check the productions:\n\nFor example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, but we're trying to see how NT9 expands. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I don't see a direct production for NT9 except in combinations with other NTs. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all the rules that have a terminal as the rhs. Let me scan through:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT23 \u2192 't34'? No, NT23 seems to produce other NTs.\nWait, actually, looking through, the right-hand side rules in the grammar are either non-terminals or a single terminal. For example:\n\nNT24 \u2192 't15'\nWait, no, let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't14'\nNT26 \u2192 't23'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nWait, and for NT4: NT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nAnd others like NT55 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, but let me check a few more:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 't15'\n- NT52 \u2192 't26'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't35'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't4'\n\n- NT70 \u2192 't28'\n\nHmm, so each of these terminals is a single symbol that a non-terminal can produce.\n\nSo the question is, does the given string correspond to a path from S down to t35 t24 etc. using these productions.\n\nSo, the string starts with t35 and t24. Let's see what S's first production is: S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nTherefore, the first two elements of the string must be the result of NT9 producing t35 and something else, and NT5 producing t24 and something else.\n\nWait, let's see: if S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then when we fully expand, the string would be the concatenation of NT9's expansion and NT5's expansion. So the first part of the string (the first two terminals) must come from NT9 and NT5's expansions.\n\nBut looking at the string, the next after t35 is t24, which should be the result of NT5 expanding to t24 and something else. So maybe NT5's production is something that starts with t24.\n\nWait, checking the productions for NT5: Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see a production that leads to 't24'. Wait, but looking at NT82 \u2192 t15, etc. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me look for the production for NT5 in the grammar.\n\nLooking through, I see NT52 \u2192 't15', NT52 \u2192 't26', and so on. Wait, but in the grammar, the start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So NT5 must be a non-terminal. So what does NT5 expand into? I don't see any production rule for NT5 in the given list. Wait, that can't be right because all non-terminals in the grammar must have a rule.

{"custom_id":"request-321","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t35 t36 t35 t6 t12 t34 t37 t20 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t22 t26 t37 t23 t9 t22`. \n\nFirst, I should recall how Chomsky normal form works. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The grammar provided has all productions either starting with a non-terminal producing two non-terminals or a non-terminal producing a terminal symbol (like 'tX'). \n\nThe string consists of tokens starting with 't', which are terminals. The rest are non-terminals which need to be derived through the grammar. \n\nLooking at the given grammar, there are a lot of productions that lead to terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, and NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT26, but in the string, I see 't26' appearing multiple times. Also, there are some terminals like 't41', 't35', etc. \n\nI think the process starts from the start symbol S, which is NT9 since S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So S can produce two non-terminals: NT9 and NT52. Each of these will need to derive into terminals in the given string.\n\nLet me try to see if the production of S can start with NT9 and NT52 leading to the first 't35'. Let's look for which NT9 and NT52 produce 't35'.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. But that doesn't directly lead to 't35'. Other nodes leading to NT9... Wait, in the grammar, NT9 is connected to various NTs. Maybe I should map out the possible ways to reach 't35' from NT9 and NT52.\n\nLooking at NT52: there are multiple productions. For example, NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT81, which could lead to 't81' or others, but 't81' isn't in the string. Alternatively, NT52 \u2192 NT81 NT8\u2192 could that lead to 't63'? No, 't83'? I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should track the possible expansions step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars. The CYK algorithm works by parsing the string and building a table of possible non-terminals that can derive each substring. However, I'm not super familiar with the exact steps of CYK, but I can try a simplified version.\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and terminals in the grammar and the string.\n\nTerminal tokens in the string: t35, t36, t35, t6, t12, t34, t37, t20, t20, t26, t41, t10, t26, t22, t26, t37, t23, t9, t22.\n\nNon-terminals seem to be all the NT followed by numbers, like NT35, NT89, etc.\n\nFirst step: S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So the first step must expand to NT9 and NT52, each producing a part of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't35'. So either NT9 or NT52 must derive to 't35'.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (no terminal here)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 (NT11 leads to 't41' which is in the string)\n- NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23 (t23 is in the string)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT2 NT16 (t2 is the last token, but comes last, so maybe)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT6 NT14 (t6 is the third token)\n- Wait, looking at the grammar, does NT93 have terminals? Let me check.\n\nWait, in the grammar, several NTs lead to terminals. For example, NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83. No, that's non-terminals. Hmm, looking for NTs that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT10 \u2192 NT26 NT26\n- NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96\n- NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16\n- NT12 \u2192 NT10 NT16 (so t10 and t16)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (so directly 't15')\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n- NT36 \u2192 NT42 NT87 (but 42 and 87 are NTs)\n- NT36 \u2192 NT15 NT69\n- NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\n- NT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95\n- NT10 \u2192 NT84 NT25\n- NT50 \u2192 I don't see NT10 directly producing 't10'. Wait, looking back, I see NT10 \u2192 't26' \u2192 wait no, let me look.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nOther non-terminals:\n\n- NT44 is not in the grammar. Wait, looking through:\n\nLooking at NT55: NT55 \u2192 't20', but no, in the grammar, NT55 is listed as NT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79, but also as NT55 \u2192 't20'. So yes, NT55 can produce 't20'. \n\nSimilarly, NT95 \u2192 't4' (as in NT95 \u2192 't4', I think it's NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 and also \u2192 't4'. Let me check: in the grammar, NT95 appears in these productions: NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 and also NT95 \u2192 't4'. So yes, NT95 can produce 't4'.\n\nLooking for terminals in the string: We have 't35', 't36', 't35', 't6', 't12', 't34', 't37', 't20', 't20', 't26', 't41', 't10', 't26', 't22', 't26', 't37', 't23', 't9', 't22'.\n\nSo each of these terminals must be generated by some non-terminal.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nThe first token is 't35'. So either NT9 or NT52 must produce 't35'.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (both non-terminals)\n- NT95 \u2192 't4' (so 't4' is an option)\n- NT95 \u2192 NT2 NT16 (so 't2' and 't16')\n- NT95 \u2192 NT6 NT14 ('t6' and 't14')\n- NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23 ('t72' or 't23')\n- NT95 \u2192 NT72 NT83 ('t72' and 't83')\n\nWait, but I don't see any production that directly produces 't35' from NT9 or NT93 or others. So maybe NT35 is the non-terminal that directly produces 't35'? Let's check NT35's productions:\n\nIn the grammar, looking for NT35:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT35 is listed under NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, which are non-terminals, and also NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56. So, no. Does any NT lead directly to 't35'? Looking through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't34' (t34 is the fifth token but wait, let me see the string. The fifth token is 12, so 't12' is the fifth token. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through all NTs that directly produce a terminal. Let me scan through each NT's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16 (non-terminals)\n- NT12 \u2192 NT10 NT16 (non-terminals)\n- NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88 (non-terminals)\n- NT10 \u2192 NT70 NT80 (non-terminals)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT81 (non-terminals)\n- NT52 \u2192 NT81 NT8 (non-terminals)\n- NT8 \u2192 NT73 NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A is a non-terminal, B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and the productions start from S. Each production in the grammar will help in expanding non-terminals into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals starting with 't35' and ending with 't35'. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process will involve breaking down the string into non-terminals until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the given string and seeing how it can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string is: t35 t41 t26 t41 t20 t8 t37 t35 t36 t20 t40 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t8 t15 t35\n\nLooking at the grammar, the productions that result in 'tX' (terminals) are the ones where the right-hand side is a terminal. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT9 -> 't72'\nWait, actually, looking through the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT22 -> 't15', NT22 -> 't9', etc.\n\nSo, the strategy is to walk through the string and see if it can be built by following the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the first token 't35'. Looking for productions that result in 't35':\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't35' (from NT4)\n- NT2 -> 't6' (not helpful)\n- NT22 -> 't24' (no)\n- Other non-terminals produce terminals like 't35'\n\nSo 't35' must come from a production like NT4 -> 't35'.\n\nNext, after 't35' is 't41'. So the next token is 't41'.\n\nLooking for a production that can generate 't41', I see in the grammar:\n\nLooking for any NT -> 't41'\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see a production where the right-hand side is 't41'. Wait, perhaps it's derived from a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, actually, perhaps I need to look at possible sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't35' comes from NT4, and then the next 't41' must come from some NT that can derive 't41'.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT directly leading to 't41'. So perhaps I need to look for ways that non-terminals can derive multiple terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't35 t41' can be part of a production that involves a non-terminal that can split into 't35' and 't41' as two separate steps.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production is only two symbols. So any production that can split into 't35' and 't41' must be a production like NT -> 't35 t41', which in this grammar doesn't exist. So perhaps I need to see if 't35' can be produced by NT4 and then 't41' can be produced by another NT, but when combined, their combination would produce a series of terminals that together form the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built in steps, where parts of it can be generated by combining non-terminals recursively.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering that each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string is a series of terminals, which must be the leaves of the derivation tree.\n\nTo validate the string, we can parse it step by step, ensuring that each terminal can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the process can be complex, I might try to see if each 'tX' in the string is possible as per the grammar.\n\nSo, first, let's list all the possible non-terminals and their corresponding terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't6'\nNT4 -> 't35'\nNT9 -> 't23'\nNT10 -> 't84'\nNT11 -> 't41'\nNT12 -> 't10'\nNT13 -> 't31'\nNT14 -> 't23'\nNT15 -> 't4'\nNT16 -> 't37'\nNT17: Not present in the given grammar.\nWait, actually, let me list all NT and their productions:\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to first see which NTs can produce which terminals.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some NTs can produce 'tX' directly.\n\nSo:\n\n- NT2 -> t6\n- NT3 -> I don't see any NT3 in the grammar; perhaps it's not present.\n- NT4 -> t35\n- NT5: Looking through, not directly a terminal.\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT7: Not in the grammar.\n- NT8 -> 't73', 't2', etc.\nWait, let's actually scan the rules.\n\nLooking through all the production RHS:\n\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\nBut I'm only interested in which NTs directly produce terminals.\n\nFrom the given grammar, the direct terminal productions are:\n\nNT26 -> 't14' (from NT66 -> t3, etc., but no.

Alternatively, I can try to parse the string by breaking it down step by step according to the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most productions have non-terminals on the left-hand side (LHS), and the RHS consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production seems to represent a path from the root to a terminal.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step reduces two symbols. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has at most two non-terminals. So when parsing, each step in the parser will handle those two non-terminals.\n\nLet me list out the string again: t35 t24 t24 t20 t6 t37 t35 t37 t35 t8 t24 t5 t23 t22 t26 t10 t4 t22 t15 t35.\n\nI need to parse this from left to right, grouping the tokens according to the grammar.

The string is a series of tokens:\n\nt35, t24, t24, t20, t6, t37, t35, t37, t35, t8, t24, t5, t23, t22, t26, t10, t4, t22, t15, t35.\n\nSo we have 19 tokens.\n\nIn Chomsky Normal Form, you can model the parsing as a series of reductions where each step combines two symbols into one. Starting from the initial symbol S, which would represent the entire string. But perhaps a better way is to model the possible parsing steps.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either A->BC (two non-terminals) or A->a (a terminal). So to parse a string of terminals, each production either consumes two symbols (non-terminals B and C) and produces a, or consumes a single terminal a.\n\nIn the context of bottom-up parsing (like the shift-reduce method), the idea is to start from the string and see if we can reduce it step by step towards the start symbol.\n\nEach rule in the reverse direction (i.e., looking for possible A->a or B->C) can be used.\n\nWait, perhaps reversing the problem, starting from the string and trying to reduce it.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each production is a single terminal or two non-terminals. So the reduction can be thought of as pairing consecutive symbols or a non-terminal with a terminal.\n\nLet me try to process the string in reverse, trying to find the rightmost possible match.\n\nStarting with the last token, t35. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t35.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, NT35 appears in several places. Looking for productions that result in 't35'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NT have terminal values:\n\nLooking through the list, I have:\n\nNT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't23'\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nNT5 -> 't22'\n\nNT23 is a non-terminal; NT23-> NT36 NT66, so not a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 can produce terminal symbols, so maybe we can use that.\n\nLooking back at the string, the last token is t35, so I need"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-360","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It looks like each non-terminal symbol is on the left side of the production and is rewritten into two other non-terminals or terminals on the right. Chomsky Normal Form typically has productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So I should check if all the rules conform to that. Looking through the productions, they all seem to follow that structure, except maybe a few, but the majority do look correct.\n\nNow, the string I need to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t24 t10 t37 t20 t6 t24 t5 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t15 t4 t35 t34 t35`. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for parsing context-free grammars. But I'm not very familiar with the exact steps, so maybe I can approach it more manually.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to build a parse tree from the string using the given productions. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S splits into NT9 and NT5. Each of these needs to derive a substring of the input. Let's split the given string into two parts: the first part will come from NT9 and the second from NT5.\n\nThe input string is 21 tokens long. Since S is NT9 followed by NT5, perhaps the first part of the string (let's say 10 tokens) comes from NT9 and the second part (11 tokens) from NT5, or vice versa. I'll need to check which way it goes.\n\nLooking at NT9, in the grammar, there are a few productions. For example, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. Also, NT9's productions include NT93 and NT95. Let's see. Wait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so both NT9 and NT5 need to generate parts of the string.\n\nLet's look more closely. The first token in the string is t35. So perhaps t35 comes from a terminal in one of the NTs. For example, looking at the productions, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', and other similar cases. So perhaps t35 is a terminal that corresponds to a production of one of these NTs.\n\nWait, but let me list out the productions where NTs are replaced with terminals:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\nNT55 \u2192 't20'\nNT80 \u2192 't26'\nNT56 \u2192 't36'\nNT10 \u2192 't26'\nNT72 \u2192 't35'\nNT78 \u2192 't40'\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\nNT85 \u2192 't4'\nNT81 \u2192 't4'\nNT16 \u2192 't37'\nNT12 \u2192 't10'\nNT87 \u2192 't31'\nNT73 \u2192 't34'\nNT88 \u2192 't5'\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\nNT84 \u2192 't5'\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\nNT63 \u2192 't32'\n\nSo each of these NTs can produce certain terminals. The first token is t35. Which NT can produce t35? Looking through the list, I see NT72 \u2192 't35' and NT4 \u2192 't35'. So two possibilities.\n\nIf the first part comes from NT72, then NT72 \u2192 t35. Alternatively, if it comes from NT4, which is a different NT.\n\nBut how does that fit into the structure? NT72 is derived from NT9, and NT4 is also from NT9. So perhaps t35 could be from NT72 or NT4, depending on the path.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, I need to see how each non-terminal can be broken down. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string should be generated by NT9 producing the first part and NT5 producing the second part.\n\nLet's consider the entire string: `t35 t24 t10 t37 t20 t6 t24 t5 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t15 t4 t35 t34 t35`.\n\nFirst, the first token is t35. Let's see if NT9 can produce t35, but looking at NT9's productions, I don't see any direct terminal output. NT9's productions are:\n\nLooking back, the grammar for NT9: I think I need to check all NT9 productions. Let me list them:\n\nFrom the given grammar:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT95 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nNT95 \u2192 NT83 NT23\nNT95 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nWait, maybe I'm confusing NT9 with others. Let me re-examine the grammar provided.\n\nLooking back, the grammar has multiple NT9 productions, but I need to check all of them. Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the fact that each NT9 can be built from further productions until terminals are reached.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to list all the production rules and see how each NT can expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to see if we can build a tree where each step is a production of the grammar, leading to the tokens.\n\nStarting with the entire string and trying to group tokens into NT9 and NT5 parts.\n\nLet me consider the first part as NT9 and the second as NT5.\n\nThe first part of the string: t35 t24 t10 t37 t20 t6 t24 t5.\n\nThe second part: t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t15 t4 t35 t34 t35.\n\nWait, but maybe the first part is 10 tokens and the second 11, or vice versa. Let me count:\n\nFirst part: t35 (1), t24 (2), t10 (3), t37 (4), t20 (5), t6 (6), t24 (7), t5 (8), t35 (9), t37 (10).

The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which I remember is a form where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t35 t6 t24 t24 t8 t24 t24 t8 t37 t23 t22 t31 t24 t12 t34 t22 t31 t10 t37 t9 t35`. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar provided. It starts with S -> NT9 NT5, so S is the start symbol. The grammar seems to consist of non-terminals that eventually derive into terminal symbols 't' followed by numbers, and sometimes other non-terminals. \n\nI notice that the non-terminals are all combinations like NT5, NT23, NT86, etc., which likely stand for different sequences of terminals and non-terminals. My job is to see if the given string can be derived by following the productions of the grammar.\n\nI think the right approach is to try to parse the string from the start, decomposing it according to the grammar. Let me start by looking at the first symbol of the string, which is 't35'. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that 't35' is the result of a production, specifically NT72 is replaced by 't35', and looking at NT72's productions, it can be derived from NT15 and something else. Wait, actually, looking back, I see that NT78 -> t40, NT70 -> t35, but the string's first is t35. Let me check: the production NT78 \u2192 t40, but that doesn't help. \n\nWait, let me find all the productions that result in 't35'. I see NT78 -> t40, which is not it. Wait, looking at the production rules, I see NT78 is broken down into NT51 and NT95, and NT51 is another non-terminal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to build the parse tree step by step. The start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. So S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNow, let's see what NT9 produces. Looking at the grammar, I don't see a direct production for NT9. Wait, no, in the production list, NT9 has some productions but in the initial part. Let me check: looking at the grammar, for example, NT95 -> NT10 NT11, and NT10 is another non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be split into smaller parts that correspond to the non-terminals. Let me think about each part of the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t35 t6 t24 t24 t8 t24 t24 t8 t37 t23 t22 t31 t24 t12 t34 t22 t31 t10 t37 t9 t35.\n\nI'll number them for easier reference: positions 1-20: t35, t6, t24, t24, t8, t24, t24, t8, t37, t23, t22, t31, t24, t12, t34, t22, t31, t10, t37, t9, t35.\n\nWait, actually, that's 21 symbols. Maybe the string ends with t35, but it's followed by 't9' so perhaps it goes on longer. Hmm, maybe I should list them all:\n\n1: t35\n\n2: t6\n\n3: t24\n\n4: t24\n\n5: t8\n\n6: t24\n\n7: t24\n\n8: t8\n\n9: t37\n\n10: t23\n\n11: t22\n\n12: t31\n\n13: t24\n\n14: t12\n\n15: t34\n\n16: t22\n\n17: t31\n\n18: t10\n\n19: t37\n\n20: t9\n\n21: t35\n\nSo 21 symbols in total.\n\nSince the original grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, let's look at NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the production for NT9, I see: NT95 -> NT10 NT11, NT93 -> NT16 NT5, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, does NT9 have a production that leads to t35, t6, etc.? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t40 (position 9 is t40 if derived from NT78)\n- NT70 \u2192 t35 (position 1 is t35 if derived from NT70)\n- NT72 \u2192 NT15 T24, but that's more about producing 't24' from NT70.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each symbol as resulting from a non-terminal, and then see how they can be combined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to work bottom-up. Let's see: the string starts with t35, which can be derived from NT70. So the first part of the string is derived from NT70.\n\nNT70 can be derived from NT78 NT28 (from production NT78-> NT6 NT13, which is 't6' and maybe NT13 is something else. Wait, looking back: NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28, according to the grammar.\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, I have NT78 \u2192 t40, which isn't matching. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar shows that NT10 can sometimes produce 't26' and sometimes be involved in other productions. But for NT70, according to the grammar, NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52, and NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52 elsewhere? Wait, looking again at the production list; let me see if I can find NT70.\n\nLooking through all the NT... productions:\n\n- NT70 in the productions: Not directly, except looking for it as NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9' or 't34'; NT22 is part of the production for NT22 somewhere else?\n\nWait, let me check each production line. The grammar is given as a list of productions, each line being A \u2192 B, where A is a non-terminal. So I'll go through each line.\n\nFor example:\n\nLine 1: S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nLine 2: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35.\n\nLine 3: NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8.\n\nLine 4: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5.\n\nLine 5: NT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26.\n\nLine 6: NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42.\n\nLine 7: NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95.\n\nLine 8: NT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60.\n\nLine 9: NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56.\n\nLine 10: NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11.\n\nLine 11: NT80 \u2192 NT70 NT80.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, line 11: NT80 \u2192 NT70 NT80? That seems problematic as it would loop. Alternatively, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, line 11: NT80: 'NT80 -> NT70 NT80' would imply left recursion, but Chomsky normal form allows left recursion, but it's often transformed into right recursion. Hmm, perhaps that's okay. Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps NT80 produces NT70 and something else. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, the line is: NT80 \u2192 NT70 NT80. That would mean that NT80 can be rewritten into two NTs. So each time you expand NT80, you add an NT80, leading to an infinite loop unless it's terminated somehow. Wait, perhaps the production is meant to be something else. Let me check the given grammar again.\n\nLooking back, line 11 says NT80 -> NT70 NT80, which would require another NT80 on the right, leading to infinite recursion. That doesn't sound right. Maybe there's a typo, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's meant to be NT80 -> NT70 NT28 or something. Wait, but as per the given data, it's 't70' 't80'. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Each production in CNF has either a single non-terminal or a terminal, which is helpful for parsing.\n\nThe string consists of a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: \"t35\", \"t6\", etc. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding according to the grammar rules.\n\nI start by breaking down the string into individual tokens: [\"t35\", \"t6\", \"t37\", \"t10\", \"t24\", \"t12\", \"t24\", \"t40\", \"t10\", \"t4\", \"t14\", \"t34\", \"t25\", \"t24\", \"t24\", \"t40\", \"t15\", \"t41\", \"t4\", \"t41\", \"t15\", \"t35\"]. There are 21 tokens, so the derivation tree must generate exactly these 21 terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each production either expands into two non-terminals or a terminal. Each step in the derivation reduces the number of non-terminals by one because each non-terminal step becomes two non-terminals, leading to a binary tree structure. So, for a string of length 21, the parse tree must be a complete binary tree of depth log2(21), which is a bit complicated, but we can work through it.\n\nThe string starts with \"t35\". Looking at the grammar, I check the productions for non-terminals that result in \"t35\". Scanning through the grammar, I notice that NT87 -> t36. Wait, that's t36, not t35. Hmm. Or is there an NT that directly produces t35? Looking through the '...' section, I find NT18 -> t35 is not present. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, I see that several NTs have direct productions to 't...'. Let me check more carefully.\n\nI see entries like NT15 -> t4, NT55 -> t20, NT80 -> t26, NT56 -> t36, etc. Wait, is there an NT that produces t35? Yes, looking at NT27 -> t36, but that's t36, not t35. Let me scan through all the '...' entries.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find:\n\n- NT70 -> NT78 NT28 (but that's non-terminal)\n- NT22 -> t15, t9, t34\n- NT25 -> t25\n- NT66 -> t3\n\nWait, looking for 't35'... Hmm, checking the end of the given grammar:\n\nI find NT84 -> t5, NT25 -> t25, NT10 -> t26, NT88 -> t5, NT13 -> t31, NT8 -> t2, NT26 -> t14, NT4 -> t34, NT84 -> t5, NT5 -> t35.\n\nWait, looking for NT that directly produces 't35'. Scanning through the grammar:\n\nYes, I see NT5 -> t35. So, 't35' can be derived from NT5. \n\nSo, the string starts with 't35', which is from NT5. Now, NT5's production in the grammar is S -> NT9 NT5. So, S is producing NT9 and NT5, which are then expanded further.\n\nWait, actually, the initial production in the grammar is S -> NT9 NT5. So, to generate the string, the starting point is S, which splits into NT9 and NT5. Then each of those non-terminals must generate the respective parts of the string.\n\nSo, the string starts with \"t35\", which corresponds to NT5. So, NT5 must expand into something that starts with \"t35\". But according to the grammar, NT5 produces a terminal 't35' directly, right? Because in the '...' section, I see NT5 -> t35. Yes, so NT5 directly produces \"t35\".\n\nSo, that's the first part. Now, looking at the grammar, the entire string is a sequence of terminals, so we'll need to split the string into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree for the string, starting from the root S, which is NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, S expands to NT9 -> ... and NT5 -> t35.\n\nWait, the first token is \"t35\", which is the end of the NT5 production. Then, the next tokens must come from NT9.\n\nSo, the string after \"t35\" is \"t6 t37 t10 t24 t12 t24 t40 t10 t4 t14 t34 t25 t24 t24 t40 t15 t41 t4 t41 t15 t35\". Wait, no, the entire string is \"t35 t6 t37 t10 t24 t12 t24 t40 t10 t4 t14 t34 t25 t24 t24 t40 t15 t41 t4 t41 t15 t35\", so after \"t35\" the first part is \"t6 t37...\".\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me re-examine the breakdown.\n\nActually, the string is \"t35 t6 t37 t10 t24 t12 t24 t40 t10 t4 t14 t34 t25 t24 t24 t40 t15 t41 t4 t41 t15 t35\", which is a list of 21 tokens. So, after the first \"t35\" from NT5, the remaining tokens are 20: \"t6 t37 t10 t24 t12 t24 t40 t10 t4 t14 t34 t25 t24 t24 t40 t15 t41 t4 t41 t15 t35\".\n\nBut wait, the initial split is S -> NT9 NT5, so the string should be split into two parts: the first part generated by NT9 and the next part generated by NT5. But since the string starts with \"t35\", which is the end of NT5, that's fine, and then the remainder is generated by NT9.\n\nSo, the first token is \"t35\" from NT5, then the remainder of the string is 20 tokens, which should be generated by NT9.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT5 produces only \"t35\". So, that's correct for the first token, and then NT9 needs to generate the rest.\n\nNow, moving to NT9. Looking at the grammar, I need to find a production for NT9. Scanning through the grammar, I find NT9 -> NT72 NT23 and NT9 -> NT72 NT23, and also NT9 -> NT35 NT36 in some cases. Wait, actually looking more carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see NT16 -> NT27 NT88, but for NT9, I see:\n\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23 (several times? Let me check the grammar section provided):\n\nYes, in the given grammar, under 'NT...', I see:\n\n- NT16 -> NT27 NT88\n- NT26 -> NT73 NT25\n- NT8 -> NT73 NT78\n- NT55 -> NT43 NT79\n- NT10 -> NT84 NT25\n- NT88 -> NT21 NT13\n- NT4 -> NT83 NT96\n- NT84 -> NT28 NT8\n- NT28 -> NT49 NT9\n- NT39 -> NT8 NT63\n- NT73 -> NT34 NT66\n- NT87 -> NT36 NT31\n- NT14 -> NT8 NT9\n- NT34 -> NT6 NT3\n- NT95 -> NT79 NT89\n- NT89 -> NT72 NT83\n- NT72 -> t35\n- NT23 -> t15\n- NT22 -> t34\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT9's expansions.\n\nWait, the given grammar has:\n\n- NT9 -> NT72"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t35 t6 t24 t24 t20 t6 t37 t35 t37 t35 t8 t24 t5 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t10 t4 t24 t34 t35` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, I remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. Each of these non-terminals then has productions that lead eventually to terminals. So the process starts from S and builds a tree where each node is a non-terminal, and the leaves are terminals. The string we have has a series of 't's followed by numbers, which are likely the terminal symbols.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number seems to correspond to the result of a production rule. For example, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal, like NT72 \u2192 't35' or NT22 \u2192 't15'. So each occurrence of 'tX' might represent a step where a particular non-terminal is replaced by that terminal.\n\nI think the right way to approach this is to break down the string into individual tokens and see if each can be produced by some non-terminal rule. Let's list the tokens:\n\nt35, t6, t24, t24, t20, t6, t37, t35, t37, t35, t8, t24, t5, t24, t12, t9, t22, t26, t10, t4, t24, t34, t35.\n\nEach of these terms must be generated by some production. Starting from the beginning, let's see:\n\nt35: Looking at NT35, the production NT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43 and NT35 \u2192 NT35 NT56 (wait, no, let me check the grammar again. Wait, I see NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87 and other rules. Oh, and NT36 is the one that becomes 't37' when it's, say, NT66 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT66's production includes 't3'. Wait, but looking at the grammar, NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56, and then NT35 can produce NT42 NT87, which in turn have their own productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Each token is the result of a production. Let's see:\n\n1. t35: Looking at the grammar, NT66 \u2192 NT36 NT35 NT0. Oh, wait, maybe NT36 \u2192 NT83 NT16. Then NT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30. NT56 \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't3'. Or wait, looking at the top-level productions: the start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So each step is a combination of non-terminals. Maybe I should build the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each 't' is the terminal, and the production depth corresponds to how the string is split. For example, the string is built by leftmost derivation, each step expanding a non-terminal into two non-terminals until leaves are reached, which become 't's.\n\nWait, but this might take too long manually. Another approach: each 't' followed by a number might correspond to a specific non-terminal's production. So for t35, let's see where NT35 can produce 't35'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see NT35 \u2192 't35', but perhaps it's derived via other steps. Wait, maybe I should build a parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated if each token corresponds correctly along the tree. Let's try starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nEach of these then splits further. NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, which splits further. NT72 \u2192 't35', so that's one token. Then NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22. NT93 has several productions, like NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, and so on. Let's see, maybe the string starts with NT72 \u2192 t35. So the first token t35 is good.\n\nNext token is t6. So after the first split, we have another non-terminal that produces t6. Looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 't25', and NT26 \u2192 't23', NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9' or 't34'. Hmm, wait, where does t6 come from? Looking through the grammar rules, I don't see a production that directly gives t6 except perhaps in the terminal assignments, but let's check the top-level rules.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar: Are there any rules that directly produce a terminal like 't24'? Yes, NT24 is not a non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, actually, the grammar's rules only produce non-terminals except for the terminal symbols. So each 't' must come from a specific non-terminal production that ends in that 't'.\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, the non-terminals produce other non-terminals or terminals. For example, some of the NT rules end with 'tX', e.g., NT72 \u2192 't35', NT22 \u2192 't15', NT93 \u2192 't23', etc.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, each production is either A\u2192BC or A\u2192a. So any production rule where the right-hand side is an a must correspond to a terminal. So any 'tX' must come from a production where that non-terminal directly produces that 'tX'. So to have t35, the non-terminal must have a rule A\u2192t35, but looking at the grammar, the only 't's are part of the productions. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT66 \u2192 't3'. But other rules have 't's as parts, like NT95 \u2192 NT79 NT89, which then derive into t4 and t35. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, the grammar's right-hand sides are non-terminals or terminals. So when the non-terminal NT95 is expanded, it eventually leads to a rule where it produces 't4' and 't35'. Or perhaps I'm mixing the two levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see which non-terminals can derive into each 'tX' token.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 't3' : so when NT66 is expanded, it's replaced by 't3'.\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't2'\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't4' and 't22' maybe? Wait, let's check each 'tX' token.\n\nLet's list each 'tX' and see which NT can produce it.\n\n1. t35: Can any NT produce 't35'? Looking at the grammar rules, yes, NT72 \u2192 't35'.\n\n2. t6: Looking for NT that can produce 't6'. Checking the grammar: I don't see any NT producing 't6' directly, except perhaps NT26 \u2192 't23' or 't14', but perhaps indirectly. Alternatively, maybe NT24 corresponds to 't6', but I don't see a production rule for NT24 ending with 't6'. Wait, maybe NT6 has 't25', but that's 't25', not 't6'.\n\nWait, maybe I've missed this. Let me see the grammar again:\n\nLooking through all the production rules, the only 't's are as terminals for NT66 ('t3'), NT22 ('t15', 't9', 't34'), NT95 ('t4', 't22'), NT8 ('t2'), NT9 ('t22', 't23'), NT55 ('t20', 't35', 't43'), NT88 ('t5'), etc. Wait, maybe I can\u2019t see any NT that can produce 't6' directly. That would mean the string has a 't6' that can't be derived from any NT rule, so the string isn't possible.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the string starts with t35 t6. So unless there's a production for some NT that leads to 't6', the string would be invalid.

{"custom_id":"request-409","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I need to answer either 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, each production on the left has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except where terminals are present. So, this should be manageable for parsing.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t24 t24 t6 t35 t37 t20 t6 t24 t12 t15 t22 t26 t24 t31 t10 t37 t31 t37 t3 t35 t9 t35`.\n\nI realize that in CNF, the parsing is typically done using the CYK algorithm, which efficiently checks if a string is in the language defined by the grammar. But since I'm just trying to figure this out manually, I might look for sequences that match the productions step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the top-level symbol is S. The first production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, where I assume NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals. So, the start is S, and the first step would be to derive NT9 and NT5 into terminals or further non-terminals.\n\nLet's break down the string into tokens. The string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, so they're separate tokens. There are 23 tokens in total. That's a lot, but the CYK algorithm works by filling a table for each position and each length of substring.\n\nBut since I need to do this manually, perhaps I can try to find a way to parse the string step by step. Let me look for substrings that match any production's right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the string, the first few tokens are t35, t24, t24, t6, t35, etc. Let me see if any production leads to 't35 t24 t24 t6'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start at the beginning and see what NT9 and NT5 can produce.\n\nThe first production for NT9 seems to be: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, etc. Wait, no, NT9 is on the left in some productions. Wait, looking at the grammar, the left-hand side non-terminals are S, NT52, NT84, NT93, NT69, etc., down to NT22 \u2192 't15' or 't9'. \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused.

Let me check again: \"NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\". Wait, no, the grammar entries are multiple productions, so for example, NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34' seems to be incorrect. Wait, no, the actual grammar lines are:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\n\nNT22 -> 't9'\n\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nSo NT22 has three productions, leading to 't15', 't9', and 't34'. Similarly, other non-terminals may have productions to terminals.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided grammar:\n\nLooking through lines, I see lines like NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'. But wait, each non-terminal is on the left, and the right-hand side is either non-terminals or terminals. So, in the given grammar, some non-terminals have productions that result in terminals, like NT27 \u2192 't24'.\n\nLooking again, NT27 \u2192 't24' is one of the productions.\n\nSimilarly, NT22 has multiple productions to terminals.\n\nSo, now, the string given is a series of terminals, so it's a sequence of terminal symbols, and the non-terminals in the grammar are supposed to derive these.\n\nTo determine if the string is generated, I need to see if it can be derived from S by applying productions.\n\nBut going through this step by step for 23 tokens would be time-consuming, but perhaps I can find a pattern or break the string into parts that correspond to known productions.\n\nLet's look at the first few tokens: t35, t24, t24, t6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, 't24' is the result of NT27 \u2192 't24', and 't35' could come from NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, but then NT10 \u2192 't26', NT11 is NT5's production?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe a better approach is to consider that each non-terminal in the CFG must produce a specific sequence of terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be the most systematic way, but since I'm doing it manually, let me think about how the string could be broken down.\n\nLooking at the string: t35 t24 t24 t6 t35 t37 t20 t6 t24 t12 t15 t22 t26 t24 t31 t10 t37 t31 t37 t3 t35 t9 t35.\n\nLet's try to split it into parts that correspond to some non-terminals.\n\nFor example, the first t35 is matched by NT9 \u2192 something. Wait, no, in the grammar, the non-terminals on the left are things like S, NT9, NT52, etc. So, perhaps we can find which non-terminals can produce t35 at the first position.\n\nWait, the first token is t35.

{"custom_id":"request-428","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars generate strings through a series of derivations starting from the start symbol. In this case, the start symbol is S. The given grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means that every rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the terminals being single symbols. So, in this grammar, all the rules are either combining two non-terminals into one or a non-terminal into a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that each rule either starts with the capital letters (like S, NT52, NT84, etc.) and has two parts separated by a '\u2192' and an arrow '->'. Each rule's right-hand side is either another non-terminal or a terminal, which is one of the lowercase 't's along with some numbers.\n\nNow, the string we're supposed to evaluate is a sequence of these 't's and numbers, like `t35 t6 t37 t10 ...` and so on, ending with a bunch of t's and numbers. Our goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, I can use the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm to parse the string. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, but I recall that CYK works by building a table where each cell represents the non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at that row and ending at that column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this by tracing the string back from the start symbol S, breaking it down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try a manual approach step by step.\n\nThe string is: t35 t6 t37 t10 t24 t12 t24 t8 t37 t23 t22 t10 t37 t36 t37 t4 t34 t25 t10 t2 t25 t41 t34 t22\n\nThat's 27 tokens. Hmm, let's see how the grammar can produce this.\n\nFirst, the string's first token is t35. Looking at the grammar, I see that in the nt22 rule, there's a production to 't22'. But t35 is elsewhere. Let's look for 't35' in the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I spot `NT2 -> 't6'`. Wait, no, looking further:\n\nWait, maybe I can list all the terminal outputs in the grammar.\n\nHere's a list from the grammar:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't6'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\nBut I think that's three productions for NT22, producing different t's.\n\nWait, actually, looking at each rule:\n\nLooking for terminals:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't6' (from NT22 \u2192 't6')\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nSimilarly, NT22 is also involved in other rules.\n\nBut let's focus on the tokens in the string. The string starts with t35, which I need to find where it comes from.\n\nLooking through the production rules, I don't immediately see 't35', so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps 't35' is part of the production for some non-terminal.\n\nLooking, for example, NT56 \u2192 't37', but that doesn't help. Wait, let's see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 't41'\n\nWait, maybe NT72 \u2192 't35' is one of the rules? Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I see NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28.\n\nWait, no, NT78 \u2192 't40', NT28 \u2192 't15', so NT70 \u2192 t40 t15.\n\nNot seeing t35 yet.\n\nWait, NT42 \u2192 't24', which might be part of some longer sequences.\n\nLooking for 't35' anywhere:\n\nI see that NT6 \u2192 't25'; NT15 \u2192 't4', NT2 \u2192 't6'; NT10 \u2192 't26'; NT55 \u2192 't43'; NT13 \u2192 't4'; NT4 \u2192 't35'; Oh! Wait, here's NT4 \u2192 't35'. That's the first time. So 't35' comes from NT4.\n\nSo, to derive t35, we need NT4, so the string starts with NT4. Therefore, S must derive to something that includes NT4, leading to t35 as the first token.\n\nLooking at the start rule: S \u2192 NT52 NT95.\n\nSo, S produces NT52 and NT95. Now, the string's first token is t35, which comes from NT4. But NT95 is another non-terminal. Hmm, but S can only split into two parts, NT52 and NT95. So, to get the first token as t35, maybe NT52 can produce t35? Let's look at the production rules for NT52.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT52 has several rules:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT63\n\nWait, no, checking:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT52:\n-> NT89 NT63\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, in the list of rules, I have:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT63\n\nWait, I'm seeing:\n\nWait, no, going back to the original grammar, I think I miscounted.\n\nWait, in the given grammar:\n\nLine 2: S -> NT52 NT95\n\nSo NT52 is the second symbol.\n\nNow, looking for NT52 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT63\n- Hmm, wait no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list the NT52 productions properly.\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT52 has the following rules:\n\nLine 3: NT52 -> NT89 NT63\nLine 4: Maybe more? Wait, looking through all lines, NT52 appears in lines as follows:\n\nLooking for any rule starting with NT52.\n\nAh, looking line by line:\n\nLine 3: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT63\nLine 5: NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nLine 6: NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\n\nSo, NT52 can produce three different combinations.\n\nEach of these productions gives two non-terminals as the right-hand side. So, when we're expanding, each step will take a non-terminal and replace it with a pair of non-terminals, until we hit terminals.\n\nSo, in S's first expansion, we have NT52 and NT95.\n\nNow, NT52's expansion could be, for example, NT89 and NT63.\n\nBut we need to get t35 as the first token. So perhaps in NT95, there is a production that can lead to t35. Let's check NT95.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT95 \u2192 NT79 NT89. But wait, earlier:\n\nWait, no, looking through each rule:\n\nLooking for NT95, I see:\n\nLine 12: NT52 -> NT60 NT81\nLine 25: NT82 -> NT49 NT9\nWait, maybe I'm confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-441","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar (CFG). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal. That simplifies the parsing a bit. The start symbol is S, and from there, it branches out into NT9 and NT52.\n\nThe goal is to parse the string `t35 t37 t8 t35 t24 t5 t22 t34 t23 t22 t26 t35 t37 t22 t15 t6 t24 t5 t40 t10 t26 t37 t8 t15 t22` and see if it can be generated by this grammar. Since it's CNF, perhaps I can use either a top-down parsing (CYK algorithm) or try to find a leftmost derivation.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, maybe a leftmost derivation approach would be manageable. Alternatively, since some of the rules directly produce terminals, I can look for those and backtrack.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, it seems that some non-terminals directly produce specific strings of terminals. For example, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. Similarly, NT2 -> 't6' and NT4 -> 't35'. So perhaps I can start from the beginning of the string and see if I can match these.\n\nThe string starts with `t35 t37 t8...`. So, let's see if the start symbol S can produce something that starts with t35 or t37. Looking at the productions from S, the only one is S -> NT9 NT52. So S is the root, and it's generating NT9 and NT52. Each of these is a non-terminal that must produce the next parts of the string.\n\nWait, no. Because in the string, the first two tokens are 't35' and 't37'. Since the string is a concatenation, each step in the expansion should produce the next part. Hmm, maybe I need to model this as a parse.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to assign each step in the derivation to correspond with the tokens in the string.\n\nLet me list out the string tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t35\n2. t37\n3. t8\n4. t35\n5. t24\n6. t5\n7. t22\n8. t34\n9. t23\n10. t22\n11. t26\n12. t35\n13. t37\n14. t22\n15. t15\n16. t6\n17. t24\n18. t5\n19. t40\n20. t10\n21. t26\n22. t37\n23. t8\n24. t15\n25. t22\n\nNow, starting from S, we have to produce this sequence. The first production from S is S -> NT9 NT52. So the first two tokens must correspond to the production of NT9 and NT52.\n\nLooking at NT9 productions, the first one is NT9 -> NT16 NT5. NT16 can produce 't37', and NT5 can produce 't35'. So if we choose NT9 -> NT16 NT5, the first two tokens would be t37 and t35. But in the string, the first two are t35 and t37. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, looking at other NT9 productions: for example, NT9 -> NT72 NT23. NT72 -> NT78 NT28, then perhaps deeper expansions. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the steps carefully.\n\nAnother approach is to map the entire string step by step, seeing if each non-terminal can produce the corresponding part.\n\nWait, maybe the CYK algorithm would be better. But since the CFG is small, perhaps a manual approach is feasible.\n\nLet me consider the string as a sequence of terminal tokens. Each terminal must be matched directly by some rule.\n\nLooking at the CFG, some non-terminals produce multiple terminals:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT5 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't73' and so on... Wait, some NTs can produce multiple terminals at once.\n\nWait, actually, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. But there are some rules that have terminals, e.g., NT22 -> 't15' etc. So those rules directly produce a singleton terminal.\n\nSo, in between, the rules with two terminals, like NT2 -> 't6', are also terminal steps.\n\nWait, to clarify: in this grammar, all rules are in CNF, so they produce either one non-terminal (which would mean it's non-terminal, but in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left, or a single terminal? No, in CNF as per standard definition, all productions must be of the form A -> BC, A -> a, or A -> B where B and C are non-terminals, and a is a single terminal. Wait, but the given grammar has some rules with two terminals? Or is that something else?\n\nWait no, looking at the rules, every production is either a non-terminal splitting into two non-terminals, or a non-terminal splitting into a terminal and a non-terminal. For example, NT26 -> 't73' and another non-terminal, so that's a terminal and a non-terminal.\n\nBut in the string, each token is a single terminal. So to generate the string, each step must expand into a single terminal. Wait, but in CNF, you can only have productions that produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So for the string to be generated, every production used to produce the terminals must consume a single production, each contributing to exactly one terminal in the string.\n\nSo, for example, the string is a flat list of terminals, so we must find a leftmost derivation where each rule step produces exactly one terminal, perhaps via rules that have terminals on either side.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to represent the string as a list and see if we can match the rules step by step.\n\nWait, let me think: The string has 25 tokens. So the derivation must start with S, and then split into two parts, and so on, each step producing one terminal and handling the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can match the string by considering the start symbol S and see if it can produce the entire string through a series of productions.\n\nLet me outline the possible productions starting from S:\n\nS produces NT9 and NT52. So, the first split is between NT9 and NT52.\n\nNow, looking at NT9's productions: one of the options is NT9 -> NT16 NT5. So, NT9 first expands into NT16 and NT5. Then, NT16 -> 't37' and NT5 -> 't35'. So NT9 would produce t37 followed by t35. But in our string, the first two tokens are t35 and t37. So that's in reverse. So perhaps not using this production.\n\nAnother possible production for NT9 is NT9 -> NT72 NT23. NT72 expands into NT78 and NT28. NT78 is 't40', NT28 is 't10'. Hmm, but that's not matching our string.\n\nLooking further, another production for NT9 is NT9 -> NT6 NT14. NT6 -> 't25', NT14 -> 't23'. So that would produce t25 and t23, but the string starts with t35, which isn't matching.\n\nAnother production for NT9 is NT9 -> NT95 NT something. Hmm, let me check. NT95 is in the grammar: NT95 -> NT10 NT11. NT10 -> 't26', NT11 -> 't41'. So NT95 would produce 't26' and 't41'. But again, the string starts with t35.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT9 production I'm considering is NT9 -> NT72 NT23, which expands further. Let's see: NT72 -> NT78 NT28, then NT78 -> 't40', NT28 -> 't10'. So that would produce t40 and t10, which doesn't start with t35.\n\nAlternatively, another production for NT9 is NT9 -> NT84 NT83. Let's see NT84: NT84 -> NT28 NT8. NT28 -> 't10', NT8 -> 't73 and more...'

{"custom_id":"request-447","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that each production starts with a non-terminal on the left and has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which suggests that the start symbol S directly produces two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t37 t35 t8 t35 t25 t8 t34 t35 t36 t20 t8 t24 t5 t4 t34 t22 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t23 t34 t22`.\n\nMy goal is to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. To do that, I'll need to perform a parsing or use some method like the CYK algorithm, but since the grammar is given, maybe I can reconstruct the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down the string into parts that match the productions. Since the grammar is a bit complex, let's see if I can identify any patterns or key non-terminals that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLet me look at the provided grammar and note where each terminal occurs:\n\n- t35 appears in NT78, NT49, NT10, NT9, NT24, etc. It might be produced by various non-terminals.\n- t37 is produced by NT56 and NT16.\n- t35 continues as above.\n- t8 is produced by a few NTs like NT9, NT28, NT4, etc.\n- t25 is produced by NT80 and NT25.\n- t8 is again present.\n- t34 is produced by NT42, NT26, etc.\n- t35 again, t36 is produced by NT30, NT12, etc.\n- t20 is from NT88 and NT56, and others.\n- t24 is from NT86 and NT42.\n- t5 is from NT15, NT49, etc.\n- t4 is from NT88, NT42, etc.\n- t34 comes from NT9, NT81, etc.\n- t22 is from NT22 in the terminal list, but wait, looking back, does any NT produce t22? Oh, I see that NT22 is two rules: `NT22 -> 't24'` and `NT22 -> 't15'` and `NT22 -> 't9'`. So t22 isn't directly a terminal; it's probably a non-terminal, meaning that the string might have a 't22' which isn't allowed unless 't22' is a terminal, but looking at the list, 't22' isn't there. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals end at 't', etc. Wait, the list provided isn't clearly separated. Oh, in the grammar, the right-hand sides sometimes have letters like t22, which aren't terminals; wait, no. Looking back, in the grammar, the productions have terminals represented as 't' followed by numbers, like 't24', 't35', etc. So in the string, 't22' might not be a terminal because I don't see any production that directly outputs it. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any rule that ends with 't22'. So 't22' must be a non-terminal. But the string includes 't22', which would be invalid if it's supposed to be a terminal. Wait, that would mean the string might already be invalid because 't22' isn't a terminal in the grammar. Hmm, that could be an issue.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The grammar's right-hand sides have these terms like 't24', 't35', etc. So each of these is a terminal. So in the string, 't22' isn't a terminal since there's no rule that produces it. Therefore, the string includes a terminal that's not present in the grammar, which would make the string invalid. So that might already indicate a 'No' answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Perhaps I misread the grammar. Wait, looking back, the grammar rules do have 't22' as a possible terminal in two places:\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't24'\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\n\nSo 't22' isn't a terminal, and the string contains 't22', which would be an invalid terminal since there's no rule that generates it as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread. Let me check:\n\nWait, the last part of the grammar has these:\n\nNT22 -> 't24'\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\n\nSo no, there's no production that ends with 't22' as a terminal. Therefore, the string has a term 't22' which is not allowed. So the string is invalid, hence the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but the string includes 't22', which is a problem. Alternatively, maybe 't22' refers to a non-terminal, but in that case, the string is mixing terminals and non-terminals, which wouldn't be valid. Therefore, the string can't be derived from the grammar as it includes an invalid terminal.\n\nBut let me check again: in the grammar, are there any productions that produce 't22'? Looking through, I don't see any. So the string has 't22' as a terminal symbol, which doesn't exist in the grammar, meaning the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe 't22' refers to a non-terminal, but in the given grammar, that would mean that NT22 could be part of a longer production, but in this case, it's being used as a terminal, which it isn't supposed to. So the string is invalid because of 't22'.\n\nThus, I think the correct answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains 't22', which is not a terminal in the provided grammar. Therefore, it cannot be generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-463","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I remember that CNF has specific rules, like every production being of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. Hmmm, I see multiple productions starting with N followed by two Ts, like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35. Wait, no, in CNF, the productions should be from a single non-terminal to two non-terminals. But here, some productions have terminals (like 't') on the right-hand side, which suggests that it's actually in Extended Chomsky Normal Form because terminals can appear in the productions. That\u2019s a problem because the grammar isn't in pure CNF anymore. Oh wait, but looking again, maybe it's actually Right-Hand Side (RHS) with terminals, which is allowed in CNF but sometimes referred to as CNF when terminals are allowed. But some sources say CNF requires all RHS to be non-terminals, so maybe this grammar isn't in CNF. Wait, no, I think the user said the grammar is given in CNF, so perhaps I should proceed under that assumption, but the presence of 't's complicates things.\n\nBut wait, the string to evaluate has only terminal symbols\u2014wait, looking at the string, it's all 't' followed by numbers, like t35, t36, etc. So the string is composed entirely of terminal symbols. In that case, perhaps the grammar is in CNF, treating each production as generating two non-terminals except for the terminal productions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, some productions are non-terminals generating two non-terminals, but others might have a terminal and a non-terminal, which would not fit CNF. For example, looking at NT6 -> t25, that seems to be a production with a terminal on the right, which would be allowed in an extended version but not in pure CNF. So perhaps the grammar is actually in a mix. Hmm, maybe I should proceed, assuming that the grammar is in CNF even though it seems to have some terminal symbols. Alternatively, perhaps it's been converted into CNF with such productions treated as leaf productions.\n\nWell, given that the string consists only of terminals, and the grammar has productions that produce terminals along with non-terminals, I think the approach is to see if the string can be derived by following the productions step by step.\n\nAnother thing is that Chomsky Normal Form requires that all productions are of the type A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So in this case, the grammar includes productions where a non-terminal is replaced by a terminal and a non-terminal, which isn't allowed in strict CNF. That suggests that the grammar might have been transformed into CNF, but perhaps with some terminal symbols in the productions. Hmm, maybe I can treat the 't' symbols as terminals, and thus the grammar is in CNF. Because in CNF, the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grammar isn't actually in CNF, but the user said it is, so perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's correctly presented, and the 't's are terminals.\n\nSo, moving on, the string given is t35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t37 t8 t35 t37 t35 t40 t15 t26 t24 t5 t8 t34 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t37 t23 t34 t35.\n\nThe string length is 30 tokens, so the derivation tree would have to produce 30 terminals through a series of productions.\n\nEach production, except for those that have terminals, combine two non-terminals into others. The ones with 't's are the base cases where a terminal is produced.\n\nSo, for each 't' in the string, it must correspond to a production where that terminal is generated.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, several non-terminals correspond to specific terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't'25\n- NT22 \u2192 't'15\n- NT22 \u2192 't'9\n- NT26 \u2192 't'23\n- NT26 \u2192 't'14\n- NT4 \u2192 't'35\n- NT84 \u2192 't'5\n- NT85 \u2192 't'4\n- NT86 \u2192 't'34\n- NT16 \u2192 't'37\n- NT9 \u2192 't'72\n- NT41 \u2192 't'4\n- NT49 \u2192 't'8\n- NT39 \u2192 't'22\n- NT30 \u2192 't'55\n- NT13 \u2192 't'31\n- NT88 \u2192 't'5\n- NT10 \u2192 't'26\n- NT42 \u2192 't'24\n- NT64 \u2192 't'23\n- NT27 \u2192 't'24\n- NT22 \u2192 't'34\n- NT55 \u2192 't'20\n- NT64 \u2192 't'36\n- NT27 \u2192 't'15\n- NT87 \u2192 't'36\n- NT14 \u2192 't'23\n- NT39 \u2192 't'8\n- NT96 \u2192 't'22\n- NT11 \u2192 't'41\n- NT5 \u2192 't'35\n- NT88 \u2192 't'5\n- NT25 \u2192 't'25\n- NT42 \u2192 't'24\n- NT63 \u2192 't'32\n\nWait, some of these might be overlapping or can be grouped. For example, NT22 can produce 't'15 or 't'9.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t35. From the grammar, NT4 and NT5 produce t35. NT4 is S, but that's the start symbol.

Start: S\n2. Expand S \u2192 NT9 NT5\nNow we have NT9 and NT5.\n\nEach of these can be expanded further.\n\nLet's look at NT9.

Wait, let me check the production rules again.\n\nWait, in the initial rules, S is the start symbol, producing NT9 NT5.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT4 produces 't35' (from NT4 \u2192 t35).\n\nSimilarly, NT5 \u2192 t35? Wait, looking at 'NT4' and 'NT5' in the terminal rules, yeah:\n\n- NT4: 't35'\n- NT5: 't35'\n\nSo both NT4 and NT5 can produce t35.\n\nBut back to the initial step, S \u2192 NT9 NT5.

{"custom_id":"request-460","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and a single non-terminal, terminal, or another non-terminal on the right. But looking at the grammar, actually, some of the productions have two non-terminals on the right, like S -> NT9 NT5. Wait, but Chomsky Normal Form usually is without such productions. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake or maybe it's still sortable.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t36 t6 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t37 t15 t6 t37 t6 t23 t22 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t22`.\n\nI notice that many of the symbols end with 't', which are likely terminals. The non-terminals are like S, NT52, NT84, etc. My approach is to try to parse the string backwards since that might be easier, though I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S and the productions, let's see what symbols S can produce. S->NT9 NT5, so the string must start with NT9 and NT5 as the first two symbols. The first symbols in the string are t35, t36, which don't match NT9 and NT5 (which would start with t35 perhaps, but I need to refer to the exact productions).\n\nWait, looking at the productions, NT9 can be found in the right-hand side of NT52 and NT95. For example, NT52 -> NT69 NT88, and NT95 -> NT10 NT11. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, checking NT9's productions: in the given rules, I see NT9 appears on the right side of NT52, NT52's rule includes NT69 and NT88. Not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of matching the entire string step by step, starting from the given S and expanding outward. But since the string is given as a sequence of terminals, I need to see if each part can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAnother idea: Since the string only consists of 't' symbols, which are terminals, the derivation must have consumed all the non-terminals into the corresponding terminals. So, perhaps starting from S, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into parts that match the grammar.\n\nS produces two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. So the string should consist of the concatenation of what NT9 and NT5 produce, in some order. Wait, no: S produces NT9 and NT5, so the entire string must be the concatenation of the outputs of NT9 and NT5. So the string should be split into two parts: one derived from NT9 and the other from NT5.\n\nWait, but the start symbol S is S -> NT9 NT5, so the entire string is the concatenation of NT9's production and NT5's production. Therefore, the string is ntDerivation(NT9) appended with ntDerivation(NT5).\n\nSo, the string is: t35 t36 ... t22 total of 30 tokens. So S should have derived a string where the first part comes from NT9 and the second from NT5.\n\nLooking at the list of non-terminals, NT9 can be found in some productions. For example, NT9 -> NT52 NT5, but wait, looking back, the rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see NT93, NT95, etc., but perhaps NT9 only appears on the right side of other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. I'll go through the productions to see which non-terminals are on the right-hand side of NT9.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5 (Wait, was it NT5 or NT?5? Because in other cases, it's like NT52. Maybe it's a typo or I misread. Let me check: The original question shows NT5, which is likely a typo, perhaps it should be NT05? Or is it NT5? Wait, looking at the rules, for example: NT10 -> NT26 NT80, which is fine, but some have two digits. So NT5 might be correct.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, the right-hand side is always two non-terminals, except S. Each rule is A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for terminals. So for instance, S->NT9 NT5, NT52->NT89 NT35, etc.\n\nSo for NT9, looking through the productions, I can check which rules have NT9 as the left-hand side. Here they are:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT9 appearing on the right side of some other non-terminals. No rule has NT9 as the left-hand side except maybe I missed something. Wait, actually, no production has NT9 on the left side except S->NT9 NT5. Wait, no. Let me reread the rules.\n\nLooking through the entire list, the only rule that starts with NT9 as the left side is S->NT9 NT5. Therefore, NT9 doesn't have any production, which means NT9 is a terminal? But in the string, after split, if S is producing NT9 and NT5, then if NT9 is a terminal symbol, it would correspond to 't' followed by a number, like t9.\n\nWait, that's possible. So if S-> NT9 NT5, then the string must start with t9 and then t5? Looking at the given string, it starts with t35, t36, etc. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in mapping the non-terminals. Wait, perhaps NT9 can be a terminal or a non-terminal. Looking at the given rules: All the NTxx are non-terminals because each on the left is a capital NT followed by two digits, and the right-hand sides are other non-terminals or end with 't'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, some of the rules have a mix of non-terminals and terminals. For example:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT22-> 't15', which means that when NT22 is expanded, it directly produces a terminal 't15'. Similarly, NT4-> NT34 is a production, but NT34 might be a terminal or not. Wait, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, in the rules provided, some RHS have an asterisk, like 't24', which I think indicates a terminal, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, actually, let me look at specific examples:\n\nFor NT22, I see NT22-> 't15' and NT22-> 't9' and NT22-> 't34'. So NT22 can produce any of these three terminals. Similarly, NT2-> 't6', so NT2 is a terminal. NT6-> 't25', etc.\n\nBut for other non-terminals, the RHS are combinations of other non-terminals, e.g., NT52-> NT89 NT35, which means to produce a string of the derivations of NT89 and NT35.\n\nWait, but in the S-> NT9 NT5, if NT9 is a non-terminal, then the string should correspond to NT9's derivation and then NT5's derivation. Since the string starts with t35, which is not a known terminal for any of these non-terminals, perhaps that's an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some non-terminals are equivalent to terminals in the given string. For instance, NT9 could be a terminal, but if it's not in the list of terminals, I can't say for sure. Alternatively, perhaps the entire derivation consists of non-terminals that, when expanded, produce the exact given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps working backward is easier. Let's try to match the given string from the end.\n\nSo, the last symbol is t22, which could correspond to NT22 (which produces t15, t9, t34). So t22 must come from a NT22 production.\n\nLooking at NT22's rules: the only possible matches for the last symbol 't22' are the productions NT22->'t15' (but 't22' would not match that). Wait, but perhaps other non-terminals can produce t22? Looking back, perhaps there are non-terminals that can derive to t22. Looking through the rules, no direct ones, as many of them produce t15, t9, etc. Wait, but for example, NT48 could potentially produce t22 if it exists, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe no non-terminals directly produce 't22', but that's not the case because in the rules, NT22 has three productions, all of which produce terminals (t15, t9, t34 as strings?),"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left side. The start symbol is S. \n\nLooking at the productions, S generates NT9 and NT5, each of which needs to expand into other non-terminals. The productions for NT9 and NT5 are all combinations of NT and digits, and some of these have string literals (like t24, t15, etc.) as terminals.\n\nWait \u2013 actually, in some cases, the right-hand side of a production includes a terminal symbol, which would mean that during parsing, those terminals cannot be further expanded. So if a string contains a terminal, that's part of the derivation, but in the grammar, to generate the entire string, all non-terminals must expand into terminals.\n\nLet me think about this. Since S is the start, we have to see if S can derive this string step by step.\n\nGiven that the string is a sequence of t's followed by two-digit numbers. I notice that many of these numbers include 3, 6, 7, etc., which might relate to the productions. \n\nWait, but the grammar might be using two non-terminals followed by possibly numbers or single digits. Hmm, no, looking at the productions, the digits are either part of the right-hand side as terminals (e.g., NT9 -> NT6 NT14 is in the grammar, but where 6 and 14 are maybe terminals? Or perhaps they are non-terminals. Wait, no, that's confusing. Wait, the productions are in the form of NTXY -> NTAB, where X and Y are digits. So in the grammar, each production like NT52 -> NT89 NT35 means that NT52 can be replaced by NT89 and NT35. \n\nBut when we have a production that includes a number without other NTs, that would be a situation where that number is a terminal. Wait, looking through the grammar, for example, NT9 -> NT72 NT83. So NT9 expands into NT72 and NT83, both of which are non-terminals presumably. But the string contains \"t35\", so perhaps some of these NTs produce terminal t's.\n\nWait, looking at the right-hand side, when a production ends with a number followed by a terminal, that would mean that the entire production includes that terminal as part of the string. But in the given grammar, no production directly includes a terminal except in certain cases. Wait, actually, let me check all the productions:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that some of them have 't' followed by a number, like 't35', 't24', etc. For example, the production NT75 -> NT85 NT85 is not there, but looking through, some NTs directly produce t's. \n\nWait, let's look at the \"t\" productions. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT8 -> 't78'\n- etc. So each time a NT symbol directly produces a terminal, that's when the derivation stops at that point.\n\nWait, but the full string is a sequence of t's and numbers. I think I might be misunderstanding how the grammar works. Let me clarify: in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So in our case, some productions have 'a' as a terminal. For example, NT95 -> NT10 NT11 is a production with non-terminals, but NT55 -> NT43 NT95, which also are non-terminals. Wait, but in the list, for example:\n\nLooking at the productions, there's a production like NT26 -> 't14', which is a terminal. So NT26 can produce 't14' directly. Similarly, NT66 -> 't3', etc.\n\nSo, in order to generate the string, we have to see if each part of the string can be generated by these non-terminals by expanding until they reach the terminals.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt35 t6 t37 t10 t41 t6 t24 t24 t8 t35 t6 t37 t24 t9 t24 t12 t34 t22 t31 t35 t37 t35 t40 t15 t26 t15 t22.\n\nEach txxx is a part of the string. Now, I need to figure out if S can generate this string.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be derived from S by expanding according to the rules.\n\nSince S starts as two non-terminals: S -> NT9 NT5.\n\nSo NT9 and NT5 are the root non-terminals that need to collectively produce the entire string.\n\nWait, but the string is one long sequence of tokens. Each NT can generate a part of this string. So perhaps we can model this as NT9 producing the first part and NT5 producing the rest, but given that it's split up, it's more about each production step adding to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a CYK-like parsing approach to see if the string can be generated. But as I'm not familiar with all the productions, perhaps another strategy is better.\n\nWait, maybe we can list out the possible sequences that the grammar can generate and see if this string matches any of them.\n\nLooking at the productions, we can note that each non-terminal has a certain number of productions. For example:\n\nNT95 -> NT10 NT11, NT75-> NT22 NT66 is not in the production as per the list. Wait, actual productions:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nNT95 -> NT21 NT4, NT15 -> NT...\n\nWait, perhaps this will take too long. Maybe a better approach is to note that each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step doubles the number of non-terminals, unless a terminal is produced, which stops that branch.\n\nBut since the string is a straight sequence of t's and numbers, perhaps the entire string must come from a linear chain of non-terminals that expand into terminals.\n\nWait, for example, S starts as NT9 NT5, which would have to produce t35 t6 and so on. Maybe each step of the derivation adds two more symbols, but the given string is a single sequence, so perhaps the derivation is entirely left- or right-heavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be built by a single expansion starting from S and ensuring that all non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, perhaps the best way is to try to see if each token in the string is present in the possible terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the tokens are t35, t6, t37, t10, t41, t6, t24, t24, t8, t35, t6, t37, t24, t9, t24, t12, t34, t22, t31, t35, t37, t35, t40, t15, t26, t15, t22.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar's terminal rules:\n\nEach production like NT95 -> NT10 NT11 might be producing a terminal if any of its components reach a rule where a terminal is directly produced.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules, for example:\n\nNT2 -> t6\nNT6 -> t25\nNT8 -> t2\nNT13 -> t31\nNT15 -> t4\nNT22 -> t15 and t9\nNT24 -> t24 directly?

{"custom_id":"request-484","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, yeah, it seems to be in CNF because all rules are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side, except where the non-terminals have two non-terminals again but I think that's okay since CNF allows for those.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t35 t41 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t20 t15 t2 t25 t41 t15 t26 t20 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t10 t26 t24 t5 t8 t9 t35`. That's quite a long string. Since the grammar is in CNF, I think the best approach is to parse the string using a CYK algorithm or to reconstruct the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut before diving into that, maybe it's easier to look for direct production rules and see if the string can be broken down into terminal symbols and non-terminals that follow the grammar.\n\nLet me see if there are any top-level rules. The start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first words are t35, t41, etc. Let me try to see if these correspond to any production of S.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, both of which are non-terminals. So, each side of S's production is a non-terminal. So, the string needs to be decomposed into two parts, each corresponding to one of these non-terminals, followed by the other.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire string as the result of substituting S, so the first substitution would give me two parts, each derived from NT9 and NT5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string from left to right, breaking it down into the possible subcomponents.\n\nBut this approach might be time-consuming. Maybe another way is to see if each terminal in the string can be matched to a production, checking step by step.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, 't35'. I need to see which non-terminals can produce 't35'. Checking the given productions:\n\nI see several rules where a non-terminal is mapped to 't35':\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (no)\n- NT66 \u2192 't3' (no)\n- NT73 \u2192 't34' (no)\n- NT4 \u2192 't35' (yes)\n- NT12 \u2192 't10' (no)\n- NT42 \u2192 't24' (no)\n- NT87 \u2192 't36' (no)\n- NT39 \u2192 't22' (no)\n- NT73 \u2192 't34' (no)\n- NT70 \u2192 't82' (it's 't40')\nWait, looking through all the rules, I see:\n\nWait, the last set has:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nYes, so NT4 can produce 't35'.\n\nSo the first symbol 't35' comes from NT4.\n\nLooking back, which non-terminals produce NT4? Let me see the grammar:\n\nNT4 can be derived from S \u2192 NT9 NT5? No, S is NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rule:\n\nAt the end, I find NT4 \u2192 't35', so NT4 is a terminal 't35'.\n\nHmm, no, NT4 is a non-terminal that can produce either a terminal 't35' or what? Wait, looking through the production rules:\n\nWait, the production rules given in the grammar are:\n\nLooking through the entire production list, I can see several where a non-terminal on the left produces a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nWait, no, actually looking for all rules where the right-hand side is a single terminal:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I notice that NT4 \u2192 't35' is present twice, I think.\n\nWait, let me list all the right-hand sides:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT84 \u2192 't5'\n\nOK, so NT4 can produce 't35', which is the first symbol.\n\nSo the first part of the string is t35 (from NT4). Now, the remaining string is the second part, which must come from another non-terminal, which could be the result of NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, wait a minute. S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the string must consist of two parts, each generated by NT9 and NT5, respectively, concatenated together.\n\nSo, the first 't35' comes from NT4, then the rest of the string (starting from index 2) must be generated by NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, maybe I should split the entire string into two parts corresponding to NT9 and NT5. Let me check if the string can be split into two parts, each corresponding to the production of NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which generates a string as (NT9's string)+(NT5's string). So the entire string can be viewed as s = s1 + s2 where s1 is from NT9 and s2 is from NT5.\n\nSo, I can try to split the given string into two parts, s1 and s2, and check if s1 is generated by NT9 and s2 by NT5.\n\nBut how? Maybe it's easier to check step by step, building s1 and s2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the steps of substitution.\n\nWait, maybe I can think recursively. The entire string must be generated by the non-terminals NT9 and NT5.\n\nLet me start by trying to produce the first 't35' from NT4, as we did. Now, after that, the remaining string must be derived from NT9 and NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into two parts: the first part must be generated by NT9, the second by NT5, and their concatenation is the full string.\n\nSo, the initial split is:\n\ns: t35 t41 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t20 t15 t2 t25 t41 t15 t26 t20 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t10 t26 t24 t5 t8 t9 t35\n\nLet\u2019s tentatively split it into s1 and s2:\n\ns1: t35 t41 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t20 t15 t2 t25 t41 t15 t26 t20 t20 t14 t24 t5 t41 t10 t26\n\nWait, but NT9 and NT5 each produce some number of terminals and non-terminals. Maybe I should find a way to split this so that s1 is NT9's string and s2 is NT5's string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to parse the whole string using the grammar.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, NT9: I think NT9 can produce 't72' or other things. Wait, looking through the NT9 productions:\n\nLooking in the production rules, I see:\n\nNT9: Let me check. From the grammar, I see:\n\nNT9 rule is: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nWait, so NT9 must be decomposed into NT72 and NT23 next level.\n\nLooking into NT72: what does NT72 produce? Let's see.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT70 NT24\n\nSo, NT72 can be split into NT70 and NT24.\n\nNow, NT70: looking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT70 \u2192 NT82 NT28\n\nAnd NT82: NT82 \u2192 NT49 NT16\n\nNT49 \u2192 NT96 (Wait, no: NT49's rule is not in the given list. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules again:\n\nWait, I think I misread some of the rules. Let me double-check.\n\nIn the given grammar, the production rules for various NT's are given.

So, the task is to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which simplifies certain aspects, but I have to parse the string carefully.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t4 t10 t24 t31 t36 t6 t37 t35 t37 t35 t40 t15 t26 t40 t10 t34 t4 t34 t22 t26 t41 t34 t35`. That's a sequence of t-based tokens. \n\nI notice that the grammar consists of non-terminals like S, NT52, NT84, etc., and terminals represented by 'x' followed by numbers, such as t24. The terminals are the 't' followed by two digits, which are the leaf nodes in the parse tree.\n\nThe initial symbol is S, which expands into NT52 and NT9. So, the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT52 NT9.\n\nLooking at the expansion of NT24, but in the grammar provided, I don't see NT24 as a non-terminal. Instead, I notice several entries where NT24 is associated with 't24' terminal. For example, I see:\n\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (twice)\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT26 -> 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n\nSo, NT42 can produce 't24' as a terminal. But in the initial expansion, S \u2192 NT52 NT9, so the first NT52 expands into various options. Among them is NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81 and NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96, but also NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, which eventually could lead to 't6' and others.\n\nWait, the given string starts with 't35 t6 t24...'. So, the first part is t35, then t6, then t24. Let me see how these can be produced.\n\nLooking for how 't35' is generated. In the grammar, I see NT36 -> NT27 NT43. Then, NT43 -> NT0 NT96, but looking through the options, I can see NT37: Wait, some NT entries lead to terminals:\n\nLooking through the terminal entries, I see NT36 -> 't41', NT56 -> 't37', NT42 -> 't24', etc. Let me check if any non-terminals directly produce 't35'.\n\nLooking for NT with a production leading to 't35':\n\nI see:\n\n- NT70 -> 't78 NT28' but no, not 't35'.\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT66 -> 't4'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT4 -> 't35'?\nWait, looking through the entries:\n\nWait, looking at the NT22 rules, I see NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', 't34' multiple times. But 't35' is not directly produced by any NT except... Hmm, maybe I should check all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the list again:\n\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (multiple times)\n- NT26 -> 't14', 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT35 -> NT16 NT5, but NT16 can produce 't37', etc.\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine how the terminals are created.\n\nWait, let's list all the non-terminals and their terminals:\n\n- NT23 -> 't35'\n- NT9 -> 't23'\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (x2)\n- NT64 -> 't23'\n- NT16 -> 't37'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT55 -> 't43'\n- NT87 -> 't36'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT39 -> 't22'\n- NT73 -> 't34'\n- NT44? No, seems none. Wait, let me look at the ones where terminals appear:\n\nLooking at each rule, the only non-terminals that directly produce a 't' are:\n\n- NT35 -> 't35' (yes!

Let me scan all the terminal rules again.\n\nLooking through the terminal rules:\n\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT22 -> 't34' (x2)\n- NT26 -> 't14', 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT36 -> 't41'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n\nHmm, I don't see 't6' being produced by any NT.

{"custom_id":"request-507","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. Hmm, context-free grammars... CFGs, right. They generate all possible strings based on the production rules provided.\n\nLet me start by looking at the grammar structure. It's presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This makes parsing a bit more manageable because each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side or a single terminal.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the start symbol is S, and the initial derivation from S will be replacing S with NT9 and NT5, which are non-terminals. Each of these NT's (like NT9, NT5) can be replaced further according to the rules.\n\nNow, looking at the provided string: \"t35 t24 t31 t37 t6 t37 t35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t37 t6 t23 t22 t26 t35 t20 t10 t2 t25 t41 t10 t26 t37 t23 t9 t22\". I notice it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like t35, t24, etc. So each token starts with 't' and ends with a number.\n\nThe grammar has a bunch of production rules that eventually produce these 't' tokens. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So each derivation starts with NT9 and NT5, each of which can expand into a combination of non-terminals until they reach a terminal symbol. Each NT produces two other NTs or a terminal. So for each NT, we can follow the chain until it becomes a terminal.\n\nGiven that the string consists of 30 tokens, each of which is a terminal (like t35, t24, etc.), the derivation of S must end with exactly these 30 terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me think about how the grammar structures the possible sequences. Each production either combines two non-terminals or directly produces a terminal. So the string should be a concatenation of terminals in a specific order determined by the grammar's rules.\n\nI think it's best to work from the bottom up, trying to parse the string against the grammar. Or perhaps from the top down, seeing if the string can be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the problem asks whether the string is in the language, I can check each step of the string and see if it aligns with the production rules.\n\nLet me look at the string again: t35, t24, t31, t37, t6, t37, t35, t36, t34, t24, t6, t37, t6, t23, t22, t26, t35, t20, t10, t2, t25, t41, t10, t26, t37, t23, t9, t22.\n\nBreaking it down, the first part is t35, t24, which suggests that the first part of the string is derived from some NT that produces these.\n\nLooking at the production rules, for example:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87 (Chomsky Normal Form)\nBut wait, looking at the rules, NT35 might have multiple productions. Oh right, in the grammar provided, there are several NTs with different productions.\n\nWait, let me list some of the NTs and their productions to see how they can break down.\n\nFor instance:\n\nNT9 can produce:\n- t35 (from NT78 production: NT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95, but I'm getting confused here. Let me try to find the production for each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see the production rules and map where each 't' comes from.\n\nLooking more closely, for example:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (So NT6 directly expands to t25)\n- NT15 \u2192 't4', so t15 comes from NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 't6' \u2192 t2 comes from NT2 \u2192 t6\n- Similarly, NT66 \u2192 't3', so t3 comes from NT66 \u2192 t3 (but wait, NT66 is a non-terminal that produces a terminal t3). Wait, but in the string, t22, t23 are present.\n\nLooking at NT22, which has two productions:\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n\nSo t22 comes from either t15 or t9. Similarly, looking at the string, t22 occurs a few times, so likely it's breaking into t9 or t15.\n\nBack to NT22: let's see how it's used in the string.\n\nIn the string, the 20th token is t22, which is possibly from NT22 \u2192 t15 (15th token is t15) or NT22 \u2192 t9 (9th token is t9). Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too detailed. Instead, let me try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is 30 tokens, each a terminal of the form t followed by a number. Since the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, each expansion will produce two non-terminals, each of which can expand further. Each non-terminal can either expand to another pair or become a terminal.\n\nThus, the total number of terminals in a derivation starting from S must be an even number plus any terminals from the terminal productions. Wait, no: each production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (so increasing the count by one each step in the expansion) or replaces a non-terminal with a terminal (which doesn't increase the count).\n\nWait, let's think about the number of tokens.\n\nStarting with S, the initial step is replacing S with NT9 and NT5, which is two non-terminals. Each of these can further expand.\n\nEach time a non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, the number increases by one each time that's happening. Each time a non-terminal becomes a terminal, it's just adding to the count but doesn't split further.\n\nWait, no. The number of generated terminals depends on the structure of the grammar. Since each non-terminal can only split into two other non-terminals or into a single terminal, the number of terminals in the string must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nIn a derivation starting from S, the total number of terminals must be 2^n, where n is the number of splits, but considering that some splits might produce terminals rather than non-terminals. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too mathematical.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, 30 tokens, I can look for patterns in the strings generated by the grammar. Let's see if the sequence of t's can be factored into meaningful groupings based on the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many non-terminals produce t followed by a two-digit number, such as t15, t24, t35, up to t99 perhaps. So the string is a concatenation of such t's.\n\nAnother approach: Try to see if each part of the string aligns with a production in the grammar. Let's start looking for t's and see their possible sources.\n\nLooking at the first token, t35. Who can produce t35? Let's check the grammar.\n\nLooking through the rules for all NTs:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87 (Chomsky normal form) but in the given grammar, the productions are more detailed. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, it's difficult to map the rules as the user has not correctly presented them with proper syntax highlighting. Let's see:\n\nRule: NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87? Or maybe not. Wait, the rules are presented in a long list, but not with proper formatting. Let me reorganize them:\n\nI see the grammar rules like:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nNT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nNT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\nNT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60\nNT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nNT0 \u2192 NT70 NT80\nNT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nNT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87\nNT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\nNT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27\nNT79 \u2192 NT2 NT16\nNT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27\nNT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30\nNT82 \u2192 NT49 NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-524","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided with productions, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF means. In CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and the grammar doesn't have any productions with more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So, for this problem, the productions are either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is: `t35 t36 t20 t6 t35 t37 t20 t40 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t24 t24 t20 t34 t25 t24 t5 t41 t10 t24 t36 t36 t4 t23 t15 t22`.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar by following the production rules.\n\nI think the best approach is to construct a parse tree starting from the start symbol S and see if the leaves correspond to the given string. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the grammar's productions are all in CNF, which might imply that the derivation is a series of productions where each step replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nWait, but since the grammar is in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So the derivation tree will be a full binary tree (if starting from S, each non-terminal has exactly two children, either non-terminals or terminals). But wait, actually, in CNF, the productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each non-terminal can expand into two other symbols (which could be non-terminals or terminals).\n\nWait, no. In CNF, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where B and C are non-terminals. So, each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. But if one of them is a terminal, then in the next step, the non-terminal can be further expanded. So, the parse tree is a binary tree, with each node being either a terminal or a non-terminal, but only non-terminals can have two children.\n\nThe challenge is to see if the string corresponds to a valid sequence generated by these productions.\n\nGiven the string's length, it's 32 symbols (each 't' is a terminal, so 32 't's and numbers). Since the grammar uses CNF, the number of symbols in the string must be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the height of the parse tree. But wait, 32 symbols would imply n such that 2^n -1 = 32, which is 2^5 -1=31, so 31 symbols. Hmm, our string has 32 symbols. That's one more. So maybe it's not a full binary tree.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the structure differently. Alternatively, maybe the string is too short or doesn't fit any possible derivation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the string, it's quite long, but perhaps the approach is to check if each 't' corresponds to a terminal in the grammar. Looking at the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. For example, let's check:\n\nLooking at the production rules, some non-terminals are assigned to terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 't9', NT26 \u2192 't14', etc. So, each 't' in the string must be generated by a production that ends in that terminal.\n\nLooking at the string: t35, t36, t20, etc. Let me try to find whether each 't' in the string is covered by any of the grammar's productions.\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nLet me list out the non-terminals that have terminal symbols assigned:\n\nFrom the production list:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\nNT22 \u2192 't34' (Wait, no, that's a production where NT22 can produce 't15' or 't34'?\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15' and NT22 \u2192 't34'\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 't14' and NT66 \u2192 't3'\nWait, no:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT22: \nLine: NT22 -> 't15'\nAnother line: NT22 -> 't34'\n\nSimilarly,\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14' and another line: NT66 \u2192 't3' (but NT22 is different from NT66). \n\nWait, so for NT22, two productions: 't15' and 't34'. Similarly, NT26 \u2192 't14' and another production.\n\nSimilarly, NT50 is a non-terminal, but looking at the productions, perhaps I can ignore unless it's in the grammar. Wait, looking through, many non-terminals have two possibilities\u2014either producing a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nSo each time we have a non-terminal in the parse tree, it can expand into either a terminal or two non-terminals. But to generate a string of terminals, eventually, all leaves must be terminals, and the non-terminals must expand into other non-terminals until we reach the base case of terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the process is to trace each 't' in the string and see if it corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nBut this approach might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long, and given that in CNF, the maximum length of a string derived from a non-terminal is a function of the number of productions. But perhaps it's better to look for any conflicts.\n\nWait, perhaps the string contains symbols that cannot be generated by any terminal production in the grammar. For example, if the string has a number like 't41' or others not present.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I can see that there are 't's assigned to numbers like t4, t10, t14, etc. Let me check each number in the string to see if there's a production that leads to it.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt35, t36, t20, t6, t35, t37, t20, t40, t10, t26, t24, t31, t26, t24, t24, t20, t34, t25, t24, t5, t41, t10, t24, t36, t36, t4, t23, t15, t22.\n\nSo we have t35, t36, t20, t6, t35, t37, t20, t40, t10, t26, t24, t31, t26, t24, t24, t20, t34, t25, t24, t5, t41, t10, t24, t36, t36, t4, t23, t15, t22.\n\nNow, I need to check if each of these terminals is allowed by any production.\n\nLooking through the production list:\n\nFirst, t35: Do any non-terminals produce 't35'?

{"custom_id":"request-525","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is a sequence of tokens, each of which seems to be a terminal symbol, and I need to see if this string can be produced by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except for the bottom symbol which is a terminal. So, to parse a string, it's essentially a matter of breaking it down into smaller parts according to the production rules until I reach the start symbol S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a list of productions where each non-terminal on the left (like S, NT5, etc.) expands into two non-terminals on the right. For example, the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the start symbol S can produce the combination NT9 followed by NT5. Each of these non-terminals can then produce other combinations, all the way down until they hit terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is: t35 t36 t20 t8 t37 t35 t36 t35 t40 t15 t26 t10 t36 t31 t26 t24 t24 t8 t37 t12 t2 t32 t24 t31 t36 t4 t8 t34 t22.\n\nI need to check if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since CNF grammars are typically parsed using the CYK algorithm, which is a dynamic programming method, I can apply a similar approach here.\n\nLet's outline the steps of the CYK algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize a table:** Create a table where each cell corresponds to a substring of the input string. The length of the substring varies from 1 to the full length of the string.\n\n2. **Fill in the table:**\n   - For each cell, determine which non-terminal can produce the corresponding substring.\n   - If a substring of length 1 (a single terminal) can be directly derived from a single non-terminal, mark that in the corresponding cell.\n   - For longer substrings, split them into two parts and check if the first part matches the left-hand side of any production and the second part matches the right-hand side.\n\n3. **Check the top-left cell:** If the entire string can be derived, the top-left cell of the table will contain the start symbol S.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is of length 2, so each step of the algorithm considers adjacent pairs of non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens for clarity. The tokens are:\nt35, t36, t20, t8, t37, t35, t36, t35, t40, t15, t26, t10, t36, t31, t26, t24, t24, t8, t37, t12, t2, t32, t24, t31, t36, t4, t8, t34, t22.\n\nWait, that's 32 tokens. So the string is quite long, which means the CYK table will have 32 rows and 32 columns, which is a bit tedious to compute manually. But perhaps I can find patterns or look for possible connections in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals directly produce terminal symbols. For example:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- And so on.\n\nEach non-terminal that appears on the left side of a production may lead to one or more terminal symbols. Since the input string is a sequence of terminals, each production in the CFG that produces two terminals would split the string into two parts, each corresponding to the two non-terminals.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each step of the parsing process would involve breaking the string into two parts, each corresponding to a production.\n\nAlternatively, for each production A \u2192 BC, the string s = s1 s2 can be generated if s1 can be derived from B and s2 from C, or s1 from C and s2 from B, but wait, no, in CNF, the productions are A \u2192 BC, so the entire string must be exactly BC. So each production corresponds to a split into two parts: B and C.\n\nBut that might not be accurate because the CYK algorithm considers all possible splits and combinations. Let me clarify: the table is built by considering all possible positions and, for each possible k, checking if the first k tokens can be derived from the left non-terminal and the next (n -k) tokens from the right non-terminal.\n\nSo, for example, starting from the smallest substrings, check if any production matches the first token and then the rest, or any possible split.\n\nBut with 32 tokens, doing this manually would take too long. Perhaps a better approach is to see if each token from the input string can be matched by some production's right-hand side.\n\nWait, each production in the grammar is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Each non-terminal may, in turn, produce other terms, possibly including terminals directly.\n\nSo to check the entire string, the key is to see if each terminal token in the input can be directly derived from some non-terminal. If that's the case, and if those non-terminals can link up according to the grammar's productions, then the string is generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string step by step, assuming the start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then NT9 and NT5 must each produce sequences of terminals according to their productions.\n\nLooking at the start symbol production, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the first two non-terminals are NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, etc. Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nWait, the NT9 productions, for example, include NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but I'm not exactly sure which ones lead to terminals. Wait, let me check the relevant productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, some of the NT9 productions are:\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (but that's two non-terminals), so this might not produce a terminal directly.\nWait, I'm looking for NT9's productions that directly include terminal symbols. But in the given grammar, it seems that all right-hand sides have two non-terminals, except for some that expand to terminals?\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar provided, all the productions seem to have non-terminals on both sides. Let me check:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t25\nNT10 \u2192 t26\nNT15 \u2192 t4\nNT2 \u2192 t6\nNT66 \u2192 t3\nNT13 \u2192 t31\nNT22 \u2192 t15\nNT22 \u2192 t9\nNT56 \u2192 t36\nNT82 \u2192 t49 NT9\nWait, this is getting confusing.

{"custom_id":"request-541","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's see. The string is `t35 t6 t24 t24 t20 t34 t25 t37 t41 t15 t4 t24 t8 t35 t37 t22 t34 t23 t22 t10 t36 t36 t36 t3 t14 t3 t10 t37 t9 t22`.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, all the production rules end with 'T', which is a terminal symbol, and most of the rules produce two terminals. This suggests that the grammar is such that each production leads directly to terminals without any non-terminals in the end. So, the language consists of strings of terminals, each of which is 2 letters or a few tokens.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar rules, many of them produce two terminals. For example, NT6 -> t25, so that's two terminals right there. But others, like NT52, produce two non-terminals, like NT89 and NT35. Hmm, no, wait, the grammar is in CNF, so each production should have two non-terminals on the left or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is either a single non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC) or a single non-terminal \u2192 a terminal (A \u2192 a).\n\nLooking at the grammar, most rules are of the form NTXY -> NTAB NTCD, which are two non-terminals. So the grammar allows for the generation of strings that are recursively split into these non-terminals until terminals are achieved.\n\nBut in the given string, we have a mix of things like t35, t6, etc. Now, the fact that the grammar produces some terminals directly, like NT6 -> t25, which is just one terminal, suggests that each step reduces a non-terminal into a terminal and another non-terminal. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar, NT6 is a non-terminal that directly reduces to t25, which is a single terminal. Hmm, but the rules can be a bit more complex.\n\nWait, the grammar has rules like NT5 -> t35, which directly gives a terminal. NT4 -> t34, etc. So it's clear that some non-terminals directly produce one terminal. Others, like NT1, maybe, but in the provided grammar, many rules produce two non-terminals, which would then need to be broken down further until all are terminals.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals, which must have been generated by the grammar without leaving any non-terminals. So to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me think about how the string is structured. The string starts with t35, which is produced by NT6 \u2192 t25? Wait, no, looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t25 is not present. Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 t25. So NT6 can produce t25. But in our string, the first token is t35. So I need to see if any non-terminal can produce t35.\n\nLooking for rules that have t35 as their terminal. Hmm, in the rules I see:\n\n- NT25 \u2192 t26, but t25 is not involved here.\nWait, is there a rule that ends with t35? Looking at the rules:\n\nYes, there's NT4 -> t34, but that's t34. NT24: let's check. Wait, searching through the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that directly produces t35 except perhaps:\n\nLooking again, I see NT84 -> t5, but no. Wait, in the rules provided:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with t35 or has t35 in it.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT42 -> t24, NT24 -> t6, NT35 -> NT42 NT56: Wait, no, NT35 is on the left of another rule, but let me search all the rules again.\n\nSearching through all the rules, I only spot NT73 \u2192 t34, NT78 \u2192 t40, NT10 \u2192 t26, etc. Wait, maybe I didn't find any rule that produces t35 directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me list the tokens and see if any of them are produced by NT rules. So the string is:\n\nt35 t6 t24 t24 t20 t34 t25 t37 t41 t15 t4 t24 t8 t35 t37 t22 t34 t23 t22 t10 t36 t36 t36 t3 t14 t3 t10 t37 t9 t22\n\nLooking through these tokens, I don't see any that are terminals except the 't's, but perhaps some of the non-terminals correspond to these.\n\nWait, the first token is t35. So if any rule directly produces t35, then the preceding symbol in the string would require that symbol to be a non-terminal that generates t35. But in the grammar, is there a rule that directly produces t35?\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that directly writes a terminal as t35. So perhaps the string has a token that's not produced by any rule, which would mean it's not in the language.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking.\n\nWait, let's see: looking at the rules, is there any production where a non-terminal is directly replaced by t35?\n\nLooking from the top:\n\nLooking down, in the rules, I see NT15 \u2192 t4, NT22 \u2192 t15, NT22 \u2192 t9, NT21 \u2192 t42, etc.\n\nWait, looking at all the rules, in the right-hand sides of all the rules, do any of them have t35 as a terminal?\n\nLooking:\n\n- NT75 \u2192 something, but not relevant.\n\nWait, the rules are a bit lengthy.

Wait, the rules include:\n\nLooking for a rule where a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nWait, in the rules, under 'NOTES' part, there are 'NH1\u2192 t35', 'NH2 \u2192 t37', etc. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the format.\n\nLooking again, each rule is in the form:\n\n[Non-Terminal] -> [Terminal][Non-Terminal] or [...] \n\nBut in the provided grammar, many rules are like NT52 -> NT89 NT35, which are two non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, usually with each production generating two symbols.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules. It starts with S -> NT9 NT5. That means every derivation starts with NT9 and NT5. Then each of those non-terminals can split into other pairs, eventually leading down to terminal symbols, which are the t's, numbers, and maybe some other letters.\n\nThe string to check is: `t35 t6 t37 t10 t4 t4 t4 t9 t22 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t20 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t6 t12 t22 t4 t32 t26 t15 t26 t34 t22`.\n\nHmm, I see a lot of t's and numbers. I notice that after S splits into NT9 and NT5, each of those will eventually produce a series of terminal symbols. So I need to trace the derivation path to see if this string can be formed.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into tokens: t35, t6, t37, t10, t4, t4, t4, t9, t22, t6, t37, t35, t36, t20, t20, t6, t37, t35, t36, t20, t6, t12, t22, t4, t32, t26, t15, t26, t34, t22.\n\nI'll need to see if this sequence can be generated by S expanding step by step, following the rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of the non-terminals seem to resolve into sequences ending in certain terminals. For example, NT22 appears in the string as 't22' at several points. I'll check the rules for NT22: In the given grammar, NT22 -> 't15' and NT22 -> 't9' and also NT22 -> 't34'. So 't15', 't9', 't34' are all possible from NT22.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 -> 't25' and 't26'=NT26 has two rules: NT26->'t25' and NT26->'t26'. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me make sure I count correctly. Looking back, the grammar has NT26 -> 't25' and NT26 -> 't26' is that correct? Or maybe I misread. Wait, in the initial part, the grammar had some lines like NT22->'t15', 't9'; NT26->'t25', 't26'. Wait, no, the grammar was:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT22 -> 't15'\nNT22 -> 't9'\nNT22 -> 't34'\n\nBut in the initial breakdown, the user's grammar had lines like NT22-> 't15', 't9', 't34' perhaps? Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the user's grammar lines for NT22 are:\n\nIn the response above, it was written that the grammar has NT22-> 't15', 't9', 't34'? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe grammar was:\n\nNT22-> 't15'\n\nNT22-> 't9'\n\nNT22-> 't34'\n\nYes, so NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'.\n\nSo, for each occurrence of NT22 in the derivation, it must expand into one of these.

{"custom_id":"request-562","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, context-free grammars can be a bit tricky, but let's see if I can break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. So every production has either two non-terminals on the right side or a single terminal. That might make parsing easier.\n\nThe string I need to check is: `t35 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t37 t22 t9 t35 t24 t12 t5 t34 t25 t5 t25 t41 t35 t40 t10 t26 t24 t31 t24 t34 t24 t3 t35 t34 t22`.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the structure of the grammar. Each non-terminal can produce other non-terminals or terminals. Since this is a context-free grammar, the left-hand side (LHS) of each rule is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) is made up of non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI think the best approach here is to try to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. That means starting from the start symbol S and applying productions until we get the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, we can use a top-down parsing method like the CYK algorithm, but maybe I can do it manually for this case.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which has the production S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols of the string should come from NT9 and NT5. Let me check the string: the first symbol is 't35', so does NT9 produce 't35'?\n\nLooking through the production rules for NT9: I see NT9 -> NT16 NT5, and NT97 (wait, checking the rules, I think I might have miswritten). Oh, looking again, I don't see NT9 being a non-terminal. Wait, let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules listed are all for various non-terminals. Let me see if any non-terminal directly produces 't35'. Scanning through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5, NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14, etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I notice rules like NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', NT22 \u2192 't34', so maybe NT22 can produce 't34'? Hmm, but in the string the first part is t35, so which non-terminal produces t35?\n\nLooking through the rules again for each non-terminal ending with 't35':\n\n- NT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8 \u2192 does that produce t35? No, it produces non-terminals. Looking through all the rules, I think the only direct terminals are for NT10, NT56, etc. Wait, no, I think I might have missed. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't25', NT15 \u2192 't4', NT2 \u2192 't6', NT66 \u2192 't3', NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34', NT4 \u2192 't35' (wait, yes! There's NT4 \u2192 't35'). So NT4 can directly produce 't35'.\n\nHmm, but where is NT4 in the grammar? Let's see the start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols are determined by NT9 and NT5. So the first symbol is t35, which is the output of NT4. But how does NT4 get to produce t35?\n\nWait, looking at the production rules, NT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96 and NT4 \u2192 't35'. So yes, NT4 can produce 't35' as a terminal.\n\nSo, for the first symbol 't35', it must come from NT4. Therefore, the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT5 must derive a production where one of the non-terminals (NT9 or NT5) can produce NT4 in the first step. Wait, no, that's not how it works. Each step in the derivation must replace a single non-terminal with its RHS, not the whole LHS.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this methodically.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT9 NT5 (let's assume the first two symbols come from NT9 and NT5, in that order).\n2. The first symbol is 't35', which must come from NT4 \u2192 't35'. So how does NT9 derive into something that produces 't35' at the first step?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal is the result of a production where that non-terminal directly produces a terminal. So for the first symbol 't35', that must come from a non-terminal that has a production to 't35'.\n\nLooking again, the only production that directly produces 't35' is NT4 \u2192 't35'.\n\nSo, perhaps the first part of the string is generated by a path that leads from NT9 and NT5 to NT4.\n\nWait, no. The start is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So NT9 and NT5 must generate the first two symbols. So, if the first symbol is 't35', which comes from NT4 \u2192 't35', then either NT9 or NT5 must produce a sequence that includes 't35' as the first symbol. But that can't happen because NT9 and NT5 themselves can only produce non-terminals unless they themselves produce terminals.\n\nWait, but NT9 and NT5 don't directly produce any terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is good because that structure makes things a bit clearer. Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string: `t35 t36 t35 t20 t10 t22 t24 t12 t24 t40 t15 t35 t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t10 t36 t31 t4 t25 t41 t15 t26 t24 t5 t8 t9 t22`. That's a sequence of tokens. Each token seems to correspond to a symbol in the grammar or the start symbol. The grammar consists of a series of productions, so I need to see if this string can be derived step by step using the grammar rules.\n\nI notice that some of the productions in the grammar are terminals, like `NT22 -> t34`, `NT2 -> t6`, etc. But others are non-terminals, like S, NT2, NT5, etc. Since the grammar starts with S, the entire string should either directly derive from S or reach it through a series of steps.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t35`, which is a terminal. I need to find which production rule ends with t35. Scanning through the grammar, I see that `NT6 -> t25` and `NT4 -> t35`. So NT4 can produce t35. Let's see which production leads to NT4. Looking at the productions for NT4: it's `NT4 -> NT83 NT96`. Hmm, so to get t35, I might need NT4 to come from NT83 and NT96, but that seems a bit indirect.\n\nWait, maybe there's a more straightforward path. Let's check other NTs that produce t35. Oh, `NT36 -> t41` and `NT73 -> t34`... Maybe I'm confusing the tokens. Let me list out all possible NTs that can produce a t followed by a number.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice:\n\n- NT73 -> t34\n- NT85 -> t21, etc.\n- NT64 -> t37\n- NT36 -> t41\n- NT15 -> t4\n- NT27 -> t3\n- NT83 -> t96\n- NT35 -> t78\n- NT55 -> t79\n- NT69 -> t85\n- NT70 -> t78\n- NT78 -> t40\n- NT95 -> t79\n- NT6 -> t25\n- NT22 -> t34\n- NT4 -> t35\n- NT84 -> t5\n- NT86 -> t83\n- NT99 -> t53\n- NT66 -> t3\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT89 -> t72\n- NT28 -> t15\n- NT60 -> t12\n- NT30 -> t55\n- NT56 -> t36\n- NT70 -> t78\n- NT21 -> t42\n- NT5 -> t22\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Alternatively, it's easier to go through the string and see if each token can be produced by some rule.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to reconstruct the derivation. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if these can be produced by the grammar by expanding S into the necessary non-terminals.\n\nLet me see if I can find paths in the grammar that can produce this string.\n\nFirst, let's see the first token is t35. I need to find a path to NT4, which is `NT4 -> t35`. So NT4 is a possible source for t35.\n\nLooking at the production for NT4: `NT4 -> NT83 NT96`. So how can I get to t35, which comes from NT4, I need to see how NT83 and NT96 can produce the rest.\n\nWait, but NT4 is followed by NT83 and NT96. So to produce the string starting with t35, we'd have S -> NT9 NT52 (from the grammar S->NT9 NT52). So S splits into NT9 and NT52. Let's see NT9's production: I don't see NT9 in the given productions. Wait, maybe I missed it. Let me check all the productions again.\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see NT9 defined. That can't be right; perhaps it's a typo? Or maybe I overlooked it. Let me go through the list again.\n\nScanning through, I see NT2, NT4, NT5, etc., but not NT9. Hmm, that's odd because the string starts with t35, which comes from NT4, but NT4 is derived from NT83 NT96.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the original grammar again.\n\nOh, looking back, the NT4 rule is `NT4 -> NT83 NT96`. I don't see NT9 defined, which is a problem because the string starts with t35, which is only produced by NT4. But if NT4 requires NT9, which isn't defined, that might be an issue.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the grammar. Let me check the initial part again.\n\nThe grammar starts with S-> NT9 NT52, but I don't see NT9 in the production list. So perhaps the grammar is incomplete, or there's a mistake. If NT9 isn't present, then the string starting with t35 (from NT4) wouldn't be possible because NT4 leads to NT83 and NT96, neither of which produce t35.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the grammar. Maybe NT9 is supposed to be another symbol. Alternatively, perhaps NT9 is supposed to be NT39 or something else.\n\nWait, looking at the list of productions again, there is a rule `NT39 -> t22`. But I still don't see NT9. So perhaps NT9 is missing or perhaps it's incorrect. That would mean that the grammar might not include NT9, which is necessary for the initial production S->NT9 NT52. But in that case, the string can't be generated because S would require NT9, which isn't part of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me look again.\n\nYes, looking at the productions, the first line is S -> NT9 NT52. So if the grammar includes NT9, then S splits into NT9 and NT52. But I don't see NT9 defined anywhere else in the productions. That means that NT9 isn't a valid production, so S->NT9 NT52 is invalid because NT9 isn't defined.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. The problem says it's a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, so perhaps I'm misreading the initial line.\n\nWait, looking back, the initial line is S -> NT9 NT52. Let's check if NT9 is defined elsewhere. Scanning through the productions, I don't see any production for NT9. It must be defined somewhere else because the grammar is in CNF. The other productions are either terminals or non-terminals. NT9 is undefined, which means the grammar is invalid because S can't produce NT9 if it's not defined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's another NT. Like perhaps NT29 or NT59, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's NT93 or another NT.\n\nWait, looking through the productions again, I see NT95 -> NT10 NT11, but I don't see NT9 as a non-terminal. So, that would mean NT9 isn't present, making the initial production S->NT9 NT52 impossible, which would mean that the string can't be generated because S can't produce anything.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense. Maybe the initial production is supposed to be something else, like NT29 or another NT that is defined. Alternatively, perhaps the '9' in S->NT9 is a typo, and it's supposed to be NT39 or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 is actually supposed to be a terminal, but that contradicts CNF because in CNF, all productions are to two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nGiven that the initial line is problematic because NT9 is undefined, I'm starting to think that the string can't be generated by this grammar. But that seems a bit harsh because maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S->NT9 NT52, but both NT9 and NT52 are defined. Since NT9 isn't in the list, I have to consider that the grammar is invalid, making the string not generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial production.

{"custom_id":"request-586","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. Each non-terminal can expand into two more non-terminals, except for the terminals, which are the actual alphabet symbols. \n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t24 t24 t8 t37 t12 t34 t37 t36 t20 t8 t35 t25 t23 t15 t12 t22 t31 t32 t26 t24 t24 t6 t37 t40 t10 t26 t22 t4 t22 t15 t35`.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, they all start with a non-terminal symbol on the left, like S -> NT9 NT5, or various other NT... rules. Each right-hand side is two non-terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe production rules seem to be defined in such a way that each non-terminal eventually expands into a sequence of terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't25', which is a terminal. So, the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and each of them must be generated by a series of productions from the start symbol S.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive it step by step using the rules.\n\nLet me break down the string and see if each part can be derived.\n\nFirst, let's parse the string into a list of tokens for clarity:\n\n1. t35\n2. t24\n3. t24\n4. t8\n5. t37\n6. t12\n7. t34\n8. t37\n9. t36\n10. t20\n11. t8\n12. t35\n13. t25\n14. t23\n15. t15\n16. t12\n17. t22\n18. t31\n19. t32\n20. t26\n21. t24\n22. t24\n23. t6\n24. t37\n25. t40\n26. t10\n27. t26\n28. t22\n29. t4\n30. t22\n31. t15\n32. t35\n\nThe start symbol is S, so the entire string must be derived starting from S.\n\nGiven that each production is two non-terminals, the string length must be 2^n for some n, since each step doubles the length. The given string has 32 tokens, which is 2^5, so that's possible. Let's see:\n\n32 tokens mean n=5 steps. S expands to two non-terminals, each of those expands to two, and so on, until we get 32 terminals.\n\nNow, let's see the first two symbols: t35 and t24. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces t35? Let me check the rules.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions:\n\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT70 -> 't78...' Wait, no, NT70: let's see, the rules:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT72 -> 't35', so NT72 produces t35. Then, somewhere else, NT78 -> 't40', and NT70 has rules that eventually lead to t35 or others. Wait, let me find all the rules that produce t35 or t24.\n\nLooking for NT that produce t35:\n\nFrom the terminal productions:\n\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT87 -> 't36' (Wait, no, that's t36)\n- NT28 -> 't15' (Hmm)\n- NT42 -> 't24' (Yes, NT42 -> t24)\n- NT24: Wait, looking at the rules, NT66 -> t3, which I think is handled via NT42.\n\nWait, perhaps I should map each non-terminal to the terminals it can produce by following all productions until a terminal is found.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express each non-terminal's production as a series of steps until it reaches terminals. Let me try to see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT42 -> t24 directly. So, if a non-terminal is NT42, it can produce directly t24.\n\nSimilarly, NT72 -> t35. So, if we have NT72, it can generate t35.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT9 NT5.\n\nLet's see if I can derive the string step by step.\n\nStep 1: S expands to NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, we need to expand both NT9 and NT5 to produce the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's look at NT9. Looking at the rules, NT9 has several productions, such as NT93 -> ... etc. But perhaps I should find a rule that directly leads to t35 and other steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look at the string and see if each pair of terminals can be generated by a non-terminal rule.\n\nThe string starts with t35, t24. So, perhaps the initial step is NT9 generates t35, and NT5 generates t24.\n\nIs there a rule that NT9 can produce t35? Looking in the grammar:\n\nNT93 -> NT16 NT5\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23\n\nWait, looking for NT9 producing t35. Let me see: Does any of NT9's rules expand into a terminal? Looking through the rules, NT9 doesn't have a production that ends in a terminal directly. So wait, NT9 doesn't produce a terminal directly. It's only going to produce non-terminals, which then produce other non-terminals until they hit the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I was mistaken earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT9 rules:\n\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5, etc.\n\nSo, NT9 doesn't have a production to a terminal. It's only NT9 -> NT72 NT23, meaning NT9 must expand into two non-terminals, which then expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 doesn't produce a terminal directly either.\n\nWait, perhaps this complicates things. Let me start again.\n\nSince S expands to NT9 and NT5, each of those must expand into sequences of non-terminals that ultimately produce the terminals in the string.\n\nSo the string is 32 symbols long. Let's see if each pair of symbols can be derived from the start symbols.\n\nBut perhaps it's more manageable to look at the string as a sequence of 16 pairs and see if each pair corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nWait, the string has 32 symbols, which corresponds to 16 pairs, and each pair must be a production of the right non-terminal.\n\nSo, the first pair is t35 t24. Let's see which production can produce this pair. Looking for a rule NTXY where NTXY produces t35 followed by t24.\n\nBut looking through the rules, the only two rules that produce terminals for NTXY are:\n\n- NT42 -> t24\n- NT72 -> t35\n\nSo if we have a non-terminal NT that expands into NT72 followed by NT42, which produces t35 followed by t24.\n\nIs there a production NT7242 or something? No, wait. Non-terminals only combine two lefts each time. So each production is exactly two non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's more like NT42 is NT followed by NT. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pair (t35, t24) must come from a production like NT72 followed by NT42, but is there a rule that does that? Let me check:\n\nLooking for a production NT that has two parts, one that produces t35 and another that produces t24.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- NT24: There's a rule NT6 -> t25, but that's not relevant here.\n- Let me see if NT72 produces t35, and NT42 produces t24. So if a non-terminal NT is such that NT7242, but wait, no\u2014the rule is for NT72 to produce t35, and NT42 to produce t24. So perhaps the rule that uses these would be like NT...-> NT72 NT42.\n\nLooking for any NT rule that goes to NT72 and NT42.

{"custom_id":"request-580","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is `t35 t24 t12 t5 t34 t25 t10 t34 t40 t25 t41 t20 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t24 t24 t40 t15 t24 t36 t24 t34 t24 t26 t41 t4 t23 t34 t35`. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF is. CNF is a grammar where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, all productions either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. The given grammar seems to follow this structure, except for some rules that seem to have three parts, like `NT22 -> 't24'`, but wait, no, looking again, each production ends with either a terminal or another production, but broken down correctly, they all seem to produce two symbols on the right-hand side. Wait, no, I see that some rules have 't' followed by a number, which I think represents terminals. So each production on the left produces either two non-terminals or a terminal. So okay, this is in CNF.\n\nNow, to determine if the string is generated, I can approach this with either a parsing strategy or by reducing the string from the top down using the grammar.\n\nBut given the size of the string, a top-down approach might be tedious. Alternatively, I can use the CYK algorithm, which is designed for CNF grammars to parse strings efficiently. But I'm not very familiar with the CYK algorithm, so maybe I'll stick with a top-down approach, although it might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the structure of the string and see if it can be built starting from S. Let's see what S produces. Looking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo S expands into two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5.\n\nNow, let's look at what NT9 and NT5 produce. \n\nNT52 is one of the non-terminals, but I don't see it in S's immediate expansion. Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's see:\n\nEach non-terminal will have productions. I'll list the relevant ones:\n\nFor NT9:\nLooking through the rules, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23.\n\nWait, but S is NT9 followed by NT5. So let me see the productions for NT9 and NT5.\n\nNT9: From the grammar, I see NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, and NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. There's also NT72 \u2192 NT35, for example. But perhaps not directly useful. Let me check the productions for NT9:\n\nYes, NT9 can go to NT72 NT23. And NT72, for example, goes to NT35. So maybe NT72 can lead to NT35, which is a terminal 't35'. Similarly, NT23 goes to NT22 and NT26, wait no: looking back, NT22 has rules \u2192 't24', 't9', 't15', etc. Let me see the specific rules.\n\nLooking for NT9's possible paths:\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNT9 can produce NT72 NT23. But wait, looking at the rules, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which is another way. Also, NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, but that's more about NT93.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first see if I can find where 't35' appears. Let's look through the string and see if 't35' is the first symbol. Yes, 't35' is the first symbol.\n\nSo in the string, the first part is t35. Looking through the grammar, 't35' is produced by NT72 \u2192 NT35, and then NT35 can produce 't35'. So to get t35, the non-terminal must be NT35 or some rule that leads to 't35'. Looking at the rules, 't35' is directly from NT78 \u2192 t40, but no, wait:\n\nWait, looking for 't35', the productions are:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT78 \u2192 t40 t28, but wait, no: looking through the rules, some of them end with a 't' followed by a number. Let me find all terminals:\n\nLooking through the given grammar rules:\n\nNT78 \u2192 t40 t28\n\nWait, no. Let me read each production:\n\nFor example, NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28, and then NT78 \u2192 t35 t40. Oh, I see. So NT78 can produce 't35 t40'. So the first symbol is 't35', which is produced by NT78 \u2192 t35 t40. So that makes sense.\n\nThus, for S to produce this string, S would have to expand to NT9 and NT5, which would further expand to eventually produce t35 and other symbols.\n\nBut wait, to get a 't', the non-terminal must produce a terminal. So for the first symbol 't35', that must come from NT78, which requires NT78 to be expanded.\n\nBut looking back, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So to produce t35 as the first symbol, I think NT9 must expand into something that includes NT78, which in turn leads to 't35'.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string. The first symbol is t35, which comes from NT78 \u2192 t35 t40.\n\nSo, the first part is t35 t40. So in the string, the next symbol is t40, which must come from the second part of NT78's expansion, which is 't40'.\n\nNow, t40 comes from where? Looking at the grammar, NT88 \u2192 t21 t13, but not directly. Wait, looking for 't40' as a terminal, perhaps from NT40? But wait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at the given rules, NT82 \u2192 t6 t15, but that's 't6 t15'. Wait, maybe another rule. Let me check all rules where a 't' is the result.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 t35 t40: 't35 t40'\n- NT4 \u2192 t35: Wait no, looking through the rules, I don't see NT4 \u2192 't' anything.

{"custom_id":"request-601","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is: \n\n`t35 t41 t37 t35 t36 t20 t6 t37 t38 t36 t35 t6 t37 t23 t22 t26 t37 t52 t35 t6 t37 t23 t15 t4 t34 t22 t26 t37 t23 t9 t22`\n\nFirst, I remember that a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form has production rules where each non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals, or two terminals. So, I should check all production rules to ensure they fit this structure. From the given grammar, it looks like each rule on the left side (left-hand side, LHS) is followed by two items on the right side (right-hand side, RHS), each being either a non-terminal or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nNext, I need to parse the string from left to right. Since it's a context-free grammar, the string must have a corresponding parse tree where all symbols are derived from the start symbol S, using the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the symbols after 't' are numbers, which must correspond to non-terminals in the grammar, right? Wait, no. Wait a second. Chomsky Normal Form productions have two symbols, which can be terminals or non-terminals. So, in the string, the symbols between 't' and the numbers are either terminals or non-terminals. But in our case, the grammar seems to only have non-terminals where the productions are, and the terminals are already replaced with specific strings in the grammar. For example, I see rules like NT22 -> 't15', which means that in the string, 't15' could appear.\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. The strings in the grammar replace non-terminals, so in the string, terms like 't35' actually represent the replacement of the non-terminals according to the production rules.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. In the given grammar, each production's RHS is made of non-terminals and terminals. For example, S->NT9 NT5. So, NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals, which will eventually be expanded to more non-terminals or terminals. But in the string, I see 't35', which I suppose are terminals. So, I need to find if the entire string can be formed by following the production rules.\n\nSo, the question is, can the string be built by starting from S and applying the productions.\n\nFirst, I should note that each step of the production must combine two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals) into one. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each step reduces the number of symbols by one. So, starting from S, which is a non-terminal, the string must be a top-down derivation of S.\n\nBut actually, I think it's easier to parse the string from left to right using a stack-based approach, expanding non-terminals as needed.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if the string is a possible derivation sequence.\n\nLet me look at the grammar and see how 't35' appears. From the production rules, I see NT22 -> 't15' and NT23 -> 't24' for some rules. But I see 't35' in the string. Looking through the rules, I find NT66 -> 't3', NT55 -> 't20' (but wait, that's not 't35'). Wait, actually, looking through the production rules, do any of the RHS produce 't35'? For example, I don't see any 't35' in the productions, except in the RHS, but no, all 't's are specific to certain rules.\n\nWait, I see NT70 -> NT78 NT28, which on RHS has 't28' that comes from NT28 -> 't15', I'm not seeing where 't35' comes from. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the grammar, non-terminals are expanded into a string of terminals, but in this case, perhaps 't35' is already a terminal.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some productions replace non-terminals with terminals. For example, NT55 -> 't20', so 't20' is a terminal. Similarly, NT64 -> 't36', and so on. So, any string that contains terminals must match exactly one of these productions.\n\nBut in the string, I see 't35', which is a terminal, so I need to see if that's allowed in the grammar. Does any production rule have 't35' in their RHS? Looking through the production rules, I don't see any NT production that produces 't35'. For example, the rules like NT22 -> 't15', NT23 -> 't24', NT28 -> 't10', NT26 -> 't14'. I don't see 't35'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the grammar more carefully. Let me check all the rules. For example, I see NT87 -> NT36 NT35, so that's a production where both the RHS symbols are non-terminals. That's fine. But wait, NT35 is a non-terminal. So in the string 't35', that would be a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by expanding the non-terminals step by step, replacing them with sequences of other non-terminals and terminals, eventually building up to the string of terminals.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach this differently. Let me see each production's RHS. Each production defines a non-terminal that can be replaced with two symbols, which can be either non-terminals or terminals.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals. So, for it to be in the language, each of these terminals must be generated by some production that directly produces that terminal.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't35' as a terminal. The only terminals I see are things like 't22', 't15', 't41', 't24', etc.\n\nWait, I think I must have misread the grammar. Let me check all the production rules for NT35. Looking back, I see several rules, like NT35 -> NT42 NT87, which breaks down further, but does any production produce 't35'? Let me check each production. I see NT66 -> 't3', NT55 -> 't20', NT22 -> 't15', NT23 -> 't24', etc. I don't see any production where the RHS is 't35'. So 't35' is a terminal that isn't produced by any rule.\n\nSo, if the string has a 't35', which is present, then that can't be derived from any production in the grammar because no NT can produce 't35'. Therefore, the answer should be 'No' because the string can't be formed using this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any production rule where a non-terminal is directly replaced by 't35'? Looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at each line, for example, NT23 -> 't24' -- that's a terminal. NT22 -> 't15', NT26 -> 't14', NT36 -> 't41', NT42 -> 't24', etc. I don't see any production where the RHS is 't35'.\n\nWait, is there any rule where an NT is replaced by something else that includes 't35'? For example, look for any NT that includes 't35' in their production. For example, NT14 -> 't23', NT22 -> 't15', NT26 -> 't14', and so on. No NT directly or indirectly produces 't35'.\n\nSo, the string has a 't35' which is a terminal that the grammar doesn't have as a terminal output. Therefore, 't35' cannot appear in any derived string. Therefore, the string is not in the language generated by this grammar.\n\nHence, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-607","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The string provided is a series of tokens separated by spaces, and I need to check if this sequence can be derived from the given grammar. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar provided. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking through the rules, I can see that each production either splits a non-terminal into two others or terminates in a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t37 t35 t6 t35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t24 t24 t20 t15 t34 t20 t26 t41 t25 t41 t15 t31 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t8 t9 t22`.\n\nI notice that each token in the string is a terminal symbol or a non-terminal. But wait, in the grammar, when a non-terminal is derived, it's split into two non-terminals. So, in the string, any non-terminal symbol would need to be further split into two parts. However, in this case, the string only contains terminal symbols (they all end with 't' followed by digits). That might be a bit confusing because if the string only has terminals, the derivation could be possible if the entire string can be produced without any non-terminals left.\n\nWait, no. Because in Chomsky Normal Form, the terminals appear only in the productions as single symbols. So, if a non-terminal expands into two terminals, that would require the string to have those two symbols. But in this case, all tokens in the string are terminals, but some might be part of the non-terminals. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals are expanded into two terminals. For example, NT4 -> t35. Wait, but in the string, we see tokens like 't35', 't37', etc. Also, some non-terminals are expanded into other non-terminals. So, in the derived string, we might have a mix of terminals and non-terminals, but since the string given only has terminals, perhaps the entire string must be produced by a series of productions that eventually lead to terminals without any non-terminals remaining.\n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the grammar allows the entire string to be produced by the start symbol S, which is defined as S -> NT9 NT5. So, the derivation starts with S, which splits into two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. Each of these non-terminals then needs to derive into strings that eventually become terminal tokens.\n\nI can approach this by trying to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done using methods like recursive descent or Pratt parsing, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try to break down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t35 t37 t35 t6 t35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t24 t24 t20 t15 t34 t20 t26 t41 t25 t41 t15 t31 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t8 t9 t22.\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to see if this string can be generated by the start symbol S, which is NT9 -> NT6 NT14, as given. So, let's see what NT9 and NT14 produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 -> NT6 NT14. Let's examine NT6. NT6 -> NT83 NT16, and NT16 is a terminal (t37). So, NT6 splits into NT83 and NT16. NT83 is a terminal (t35). So, NT6 is t35 t37.\n\nSimilarly, NT14: Looking into the grammar, NT14 appears in several places. For example, NT14 is part of NT69 which is derived into NT85 NT52 when NT93 is split into NT14. Wait, maybe I should look at NT14 directly. From the grammar, NT14 \u2192 NT8\u2192... Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see NT14 is used in:\n\n- NT93 -> NT14 NT23 (twice)\n- Also, NT51 is derived into NT27 NT60, and another rule may involve NT14.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for all production rules that end with NT14 on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT14 doesn't directly appear as a left-hand side. Wait, let me check the rules again. Hmm, perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT64 \u2192 't23'\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a list of all the production rules to see where each non-terminal is derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be divided into parts that correspond to the productions.\n\nSince the entire string is a series of terminals, let's see if it can be split into chunks that match the productions.\n\nStarting with the initial symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the string should start with NT9 and NT5, which we can check if they produce the beginning part of the string.\n\nLooking at NT9: from the rules, NT9 can be derived into NT6 NT14. So, NT9 would produce two terminals. Let's see, according to the grammar:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16 (t35 t37) and NT14 \u2192 ?\n\nWait, looking at NT14, in the production rules, is there anywhere NT14 appears on the left? I think I need to find the productions where NT14 is on the left. Scanning through:\n\nI see NT14 is not directly a left-hand side in the given rules. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nNo, I think the rules don't have NT14 as a left-hand side. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Checking all the rules:\n\nLooking at the list, the left-hand sides are:\n\nS, NT9, NT52, NT84, NT93 (appears multiple times), NT69, NT95, NT0, NT93 (again), NT52, NT52 again, NT35, NT42, NT22, NT86, NT79, NT43, NT83, NT82, NT36, NT15, NT88, NT4, NT10, NT88, NT4, NT56, NT36, NT15 again, NT43, NT0, NT27, NT22, etc.\n\nSo, NT14 is not explicitly appearing as a left-hand side in any production. Hmm, that's odd. So, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol is S, which is NT9 NT5. So, NT9 is S's first component, and NT5 is its second. Let's see NT5's production.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT5 is derived into NT70 NT80. So, NT5 \u2192 NT70 NT80.\n\nThen, starting from S, the initial expansion would be NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14 (although NT14 isn't a terminal; wait, no, because NT14 itself isn't a terminal in the grammar as far as I can tell. So, maybe we need to see if NT14 can be further derived into terminals or if it's a problem because it's not a terminal.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps in the string, 't22' appears, which is one of the terminals. Looking at the grammar, NT22 is defined as terminals 't15' or 't9'. So, perhaps in the derivation, somewhere there's a production where NT22 is split into 't15' or 't9'.\n\nBut earlier, in S's expansion, we have NT5 \u2192 NT70 NT80. Now, NT70 is a terminal 't28'.\n\nWait, let me try to write down the expansions.\n\nFrom S:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\nNT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT5 \u2192 NT70 NT80\n\nSo, after these expansions, we have NT6, NT14, NT70, NT80.\n\nNow, NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16 \u2192 t35 t37 (from the rules, NT83 is 't35' and NT16 is 't37')\n\nSo, NT6 becomes t35 t37.\n\nNT70 is a terminal 't28'.\n\nThen, NT14:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-628","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This helps because it simplifies how I might approach the problem, although even so, it's still a bit complicated.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t35 t37 t20 t34 t25 t37 t41 t10 t26 t35 t37 t22 t9 t6 t37 t8 t24 t10 t36 t20 t26 t41 t10 t31 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t22`.\n\nFirst, I notice that all these are terminals except a few that might be non-terminals. But from the grammar provided, I see that many symbols like NT95, NT4, etc., are non-terminals, but the string consists mostly of terminals like 't35', 't20', etc. So, I think the approach should be to work backward: starting from the string and try to split it into parts that match the productions.\n\nThe goal is to split the string into a series of non-terminals that can be reduced according to the grammar until we reach the start symbol S.\n\nLet's start by writing the string as a list:\n\n[t35, t37, t20, t34, t25, t37, t41, t10, t26, t35, t37, t22, t9, t6, t37, t8, t24, t10, t36, t20, t26, t41, t10, t31, t24, t12, t9, t22, t26, t24, t5, t23, t9, t22]\n\nI'll start looking for possible splits from the beginning.\n\nLooking at the first few tokens: t35, t37, t20.\n\nI check if any production ends with these. From the grammar, I see that NT26 \u2192 t14, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I should look at the productions that produce t35, t37, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that NT22 \u2192 t15, t34. So t22 can be split into t15 and t34. Similarly, t37 might come from NT85 \u2192 t21, t4. Or maybe t37 comes from NT70 \u2192 t82, t28. Wait, no, because t37 is a terminal, perhaps from NT85.\n\nWait, let's look at the grammar to see where t35, t37, etc., appear as results.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT22 \u2192 t15, t34. So if I have t15 followed by t34, that could be part of the string.\n\nWait, but I'm starting with t35, t37. Let me check the productions:\n\nLooking for t35 as a result of a production. From the grammar, I see NT25 \u2192 t25, which is a single terminal, so that may not help. Wait, looking further, NT25 \u2192 t25 is a production, so if a non-terminal NT25 expands to 't25', but that's a single token. So perhaps t25 must come from NT25.\n\nBut let's get back. The string starts with t35, t37, t20.\n\nLooking for a production that results in these terminals in order. For example, is there any production where the right-hand side is t35, t37, t20? Probably not, since productions are in two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps t35 and t37 are parts of a longer split. Let me think about which non-terminals produce t35 and t37.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT22 \u2192 t15, t34\n\nNT83 \u2192 t56, t30\n\nNT95 \u2192 t10, t11\n\nWait, looking at NT95: NT95 \u2192 NT10, NT11. But in the string, I have t10 and t11 later, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nAlternatively, looking for something that could generate t35. Wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35. So NT89 \u2192 t72, t23. So NT52 would produce t72, t23, and then t35. Hmm, but that's three tokens, but NT52 is a two-step production. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, NT52 \u2192 NT89, NT35. Then, NT89 \u2192 t72, t23. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to see what each production does.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to start from the end and see if I can reconstruct the parse from the end. That might sometimes be easier, as it can lead to a more straightforward approach.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: ... t9, t22. t29? No, the last tokens are t9, t22. Wait, let me write the last few tokens: t9, t22. Let me see what could produce these.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 t15, t34. But t15 and t34 are separate. Alternatively, is there a production that ends with t22 as a single token? From the grammar, I see NT27 \u2192 't24', so that's a single token. Similarly, NT22 can't be split further, but in the string, it's just t22. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce a single terminal, like NT22 \u2192 't24', so t24 is directly from NT22. Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't24', which is a single token. So t24 can come from either NT22, NT27, or other non-terminals.\n\nBut in the string, I have t24, t10, t36, etc. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should work from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo, S can expand to NT9, NT52.\n\nSo, first, let's see what NT9 expands to. From the grammar, NT9 \u2192 NT72, NT23.\n\nSo NT9 expands to NT72, NT23.\n\nNow, let's see what NT72 and NT23 expand to.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT72 \u2192 t35, t23. So that's a two-symbol production. Wait, NT72 \u2192 t35, t23. So if NT72 expands to t35, t23, then when we have those as the first two symbols, we can consider that.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first two symbols are t35, t37. Not quite. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities.\n\nLet me consider that S \u2192 NT9, NT52.\n\nSo, when parsing, the parser would split the string into two parts: what NT9 produces and what NT52 produces.\n\nSo, if the string is `t35 t37 t20 t34 t25 t37 t41 t10 t26 t35 t37 t22 t9 t6 t37 t8 t24 t10 t36 t20 t26 t41 t10 t31 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t22`, we can split it into part1 and part2, where part1 is the expansion of NT9 and part2 is the expansion of NT52.\n\nSo, I need to find a split point such that the first part corresponds to NT9's expansion and the second to NT52's.\n\nLooking at NT9: NT9 \u2192 NT72, NT23.\n\nThen NT72 \u2192 't35', 't23'.\n\nWait, but t23 is a terminal, and if NT72 is a two-symbol production, then it expands to 't35', 't23'.\n\nSo, if the first part is 't35', 't23...', but in the string, the first token after t35 is t37, which isn't t23. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT9 doesn't expand to NT72, NT23 but maybe there's another way.

{"custom_id":"request-626","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me take this step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string I'm given is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if it can be derived by applying these rules.\n\nThe string is: t35 t6 t24 t10 t36 t40 t15 t31 t10 t41 t6 t37 t35 t37 t35 t8 t35 t6 t24 t10 t37 t6 t23 t22 t4 t10 t37 t34 t12 t2 t32 t26 t15 t22.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals map directly to terminals. For example, NT22 can be 't15', 't9', etc. So, the first step is to check if each token in the string is covered by any production rule.\n\nLet me go through the string from beginning to end.\n\n1. t35: Looking at the grammar, NT35 is defined as NT42 NT87. The productions for NT42 and NT87 include 't24' and 't36', etc., but I'm not sure yet. Wait, NT36 is defined with 't41' and 't37', but none of these directly produce 't35'. Hmm, maybe NT35 is part of a longer production. Alternatively, looking at NT35's productions: NT35 is in the productions, and some rules produce 't24', but maybe it's part of a larger structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of this as a parse tree. Each step should produce the terminals in the string in order, building up from S.\n\nAnother approach is to check if each token appears in the grammar. For example, each 't' like t35, t6, etc., should correspond to a production that only has terminals. So, I need to ensure each token is present in the grammar's terminal rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example, NT35 has a production that leads to these terminals. Wait, let's check where NT35 is used. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any productions for NT35 beyond the initial S. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the grammar rules provided.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, right? So the entire string would have to be generated from S. Each step would replace non-terminals with other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should approach this by trying to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar rules. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the parse tree should have no symbols beyond the root S, so the number of productions should be such that the length of the string is correct.\n\nLet me think about the number of symbols in the string. The string has 35 tokens. Let me count: 1. t35, 2. t6, 3. t24, 4. t10, 5. t36, 6. t40, 7. t15, 8. t31, 9. t10, 10. t41, 11. t6, 12. t37, 13. t35, 14. t37, 15. t35, 16. t8, 17. t35, 18. t6, 19. t24, 20. t10, 21. t37, 22. t6, 23. t23, 24. t22, 25. t4, 26. t10, 27. t37, 28. t34, 29. t12, 30. t2, 31. t32, 32. t26, 33. t15, 34. t22.\n\nSo, 35 tokens. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with exactly two non-terminals (since all productions are A \u2192 BC). The string length starts at 1 (the root S), then grows by 1 each step until it ends with 35. So, the length is 35, which is an odd number, which isn't possible because in CNF, the length of the string after k steps is 2^k. Since 35 is not a power of 2, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but the initial string has 35 tokens. Let me double-check: Each production step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals, so the number of symbols doubles each time. Starting from S (1 symbol), after one step, 2 symbols, after two steps, 4, then 8, 16, 32, etc. So the total number of symbols must be 2^k for some k. But 35 isn't a power of 2. Therefore, the string can't be generated by this grammar because the number of symbols isn't a power of two, which is a requirement for CNF grammars.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate because S might be the root, and the number of symbols produced is 2^n where n is the number of steps. So if the string has m symbols, then 2^n = m. Since 35 isn't a power of 2, it's impossible. Therefore, the answer is 'No' because the string's length isn't a power of two, which is a requirement for strings generated by CNF grammars.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 35 symbols, and in a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols generated must be a power of 2. Since 35 is not a power of 2, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-641","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t35 t41 t26 t41 t20 t40 t15 t26 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t6 t37 t10 t41 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t6 t23 t22 t26 t15 t24 t12 t9 t22 t31 t8 t9 t35`. \n\nFirst, I should understand that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That helps because it simplifies parsing, and I might be able to model this as a pushdown automaton or use dynamic programming for parsing.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that it starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Each non-terminal on the left is connected to pairs of other non-terminals or terminals on the right. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, and so on. \n\nTerminal symbols are everything that's lowercase letters, like 't35', 't41', etc. Non-terminals are the uppercase ones, such as NT9, NT52, etc.\n\nSo, the task is to see if this string can be derived from S. Since the grammar is C-NF, I might consider using CYK parsing, which is efficient for CNF grammars, but I'm not sure if I want to code that here. Alternatively, I can try to simulate the steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build the parse tree step by step. Let me list the string again: t35 t41 t26 t41 t20 t40 t15 t26 t24 t10 t37 t8 t35 t6 t37 t10 t41 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t6 t23 t22 t26 t15 t24 t12 t9 t22 t31 t8 t9 t35.\n\nWait, the length is 38 tokens, which might correspond to the length of the string to be parsed. \n\nI'll try to see if each token can be matched by a production rule. \n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, S will produce two parts: one starting with NT9 and the other with NT5.\n\nI need to see if the entire string can be divided into two parts: the first produced by NT9 and the second by NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t35. Let's check the productions for NT9.\n\nNT9: Looking at the grammar, I see NT93, but wait, the start is NT9, but in the grammar, I don't see a production for NT9 directly. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, the non-terminals like NT9, NT52, etc., are defined with other rules.\n\nWait a second, I need to look through the productions to see how each non-terminal can generate certain strings.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT9, I need to check each one. Let me scan through the productions:\n\nLooking for NT9:\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 ... Hmm, wait, looking at the rules: I see NT98? Wait, no, I don't see an NT9 in the left-hand side except in the first production. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, the given grammar starts with S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and the rest are various non-terminals. Looking through the list:\n\nI see NT95, NT93, etc., but not directly NT9 \u2192 something. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check the initial rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT72 \u2192 t35 (I think when I saw the table, there's a line like NT72 \u2192 t35.)\n\nSo, NT9 can produce t35 t23, but in the string, the first token is t35, followed by t41. So, that wouldn't match, unless t23 is next. But then, the second token is t41, which doesn't match t23, so it's a mismatch. Hmm, maybe another production.\n\nWait, looking at all the productions for NT9:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n- NT72 \u2192 t35\n- NT14 \u2192 t23 (Wait, NT14 is another non-terminal.)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to list all the NT9 productions:\n\nFrom the given rules, in the grammar:\n\nLooking for where NT9 appears as LHS:\n\n- No, the only production with NT9 on the left is likely from the given rules. Wait, maybe a table is presented in the form of NT9 x, but perhaps I'm missing it.\n\nWait, in the given production rules, all the NT9 entries are on the LHS. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see any production like NT9 \u2192 ... except perhaps from the start, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which may imply that NT9 and NT5 are themselves built from other productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. So, in the given grammar, the first production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which is a start symbol producing two non-terminals. Each of those non-terminals can be further expanded into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo, to derive the string, each token in the string must be matched by a production, either as a terminal or as part of a larger derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is structured so that each production for a non-terminal eventually leads to terminals. So, for example, NT9 might expand into a series of steps that result in a single terminal or multiple terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to see whether the given string can be split into parts that conform to the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nSo, starting with the first token, t35. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t35 directly or via other productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT6 \u2192 t25 (from NT6 \u2192 t25)\nBut t35 is produced by NT78 \u2192 t40\nWait, I need to look for each production rule that leads to a terminal. For example, some of the rules go: NT6 \u2192 t25, NT15 \u2192 t4, NT22 \u2192 t15, etc.\n\nWait, let's list all rules where a non-terminal is connected to a terminal:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT72 \u2192 t35\n- NT78 \u2192 t40\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n- NT55 \u2192 t20\n- NT35 \u2192 t35 (Wait, hold on.)\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, some non-terminals are directly connected to terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n- NT4 \u2192 t34\n- NT84 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t4\n- NT16 \u2192 t37\n- NT23 \u2192 t31\n- NT26 \u2192 t23 (another production for NT26: NT26 \u2192 t23)\n- NT44? Wait, no, I don't see that.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, here are the terminal productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t25\nNT72 \u2192 t35\nNT78 \u2192 t40\nNT26 \u2192 t14\nNT55 \u2192 t20\nNT4 \u2192 t34\nNT84 \u2192 t5\nNT85 \u2192 t4\nNT16 \u2192 t37\nNT23 \u2192 t31\nNT26 \u2192 t23 (another one)\nNT42 \u2192 t24\nNT8 \u2192 t2\nNT87 \u2192 t36\nNT14 \u2192 t8\nNT88 \u2192 t5\nNT25 \u2192 t25\nNT49 \u2192 t8\nNT13 \u2192 t31\nNT11 \u2192 t41\nSimilarly, NT42, NT14, etc.\n\nWait, looking again, each of these non-terminals can produce a single terminal. So for example, NT72 can produce 't35', which is the first token in the string.\n\nSo, the first part of the string is 't35'. So, that can be matched by NT72 \u2192 t35.\n\nBut how does that fit into the overall S \u2192 NT9 NT5? Because NT9 and NT5 would expand into different parts of the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is divided into two parts: the first part is generated by NT9 and the second by NT5.

For example, NT66 \u2192 't3', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT22 has multiple productions, some leading to terminals like 't24', 't15', 't9'. So each of these terminals can be seen as leaves that result from these non-terminals.\n\nThe string in question starts with t35, t37, t35... So I need to see where these terminals come from. Let me look at the productions that result in these terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT96 \u2192 't22'\n- NT22 \u2192 't34', 't15', 't9'\n- NT55 \u2192 't20', 't26', 't35', 't43'\n- NT42 \u2192 't24'\n- NT63 \u2192 't32'\n- NT84 \u2192 't5'\n- NT60 \u2192 't12'\n- NT35 \u2192 't23', 't8' (from NT42 perhaps)\nWait, actually, I should look up each terminal and see which non-terminals produce them.\n\nFor example:\n\nt35 comes from NT96 (no, NT96 produces t22, t36, t35, t4. Wait, looking again, NT96's productions are \"NT63 \u2192 NT32\" which is t32, but NT96 has NT96 \u2192 't22'. Hmm, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nWait, the productions given include:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't34', 't15', 't9'\n\nNT64 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT49 \u2192 't8'\n\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT86 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT39 \u2192 't22'\n\nNT73 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT87 \u2192 't36'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't10'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through each terminal and see which production leads to it.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- t9: Looking at NT56 \u2192 't26' and other rules, wait, no NT56 produces 't26', t14, t26... No, let's check.\n\nWait, I think the correct approach is to create a mapping from the terminals to the non-terminals that generate them. For each 't' followed by a number in the string, find which non-terminals can directly produce that 't'.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for 't32': which non-terminals have a production -> 't32'? Looking at NT66 \u2192 't3'? Wait, no, I see NT66 \u2192 't3' is a production, but looking at the actual rule, it's NT66 \u2192 NT39 and 't3', not just 't3'. Wait no, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is A \u2192 B C or A \u2192 a. So some rules are just A \u2192 a, like NT66 \u2192 t3, NT25 \u2192 t25, etc.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again:\n\nLooking for each rule where the right-hand side is a single terminal.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT66 \u2192 't3' (looking at the provided rules)\nSimilarly, NT25 \u2192 't25'\nNT55 \u2192 't20', 't26', 't35', 't43'\nNT64 \u2192 't23'\nNT49 \u2192 't8'\nNT13 \u2192 't31'\nNT8 \u2192 't2'\nNT86 \u2192 't34'\nNT14 \u2192 't23'\nNT39 \u2192 't22'\nNT73 \u2192 't34'\nNT87 \u2192 't36'\nNT28 \u2192 't10'\nNT66 \u2192 't4' (Wait, no, earlier I saw NT66 \u2192 t3, but perhaps I misread.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, so each 't' followed by a number is a single token.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. The start symbol is S. My goal is to parse the string according to these productions.\n\nThe string is: t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t24 t37 t20 t8 t35 t37 t22 t9 t35 t36 t35 t8 t35 t6 t37 t10 t37 t15 t12 t2 t32 t26 t24 t36 t26 t24 t24 t14 t37 t41 t34 t22.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar productions that produce terminals because in CNF, each right-hand side must consist of exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production has exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. So any production where the right-hand side is a single terminal is already in CNF, but others must produce two.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals. So in the given grammar, I should check if all productions are like that. Let me look at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, almost all rules have two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. But some have a single terminal, like NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14, but also NT93 \u2192 NT21 NT42 and others. Wait, no, actually in the given grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, both NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals. Similarly, NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, again two non-terminals. Oh, but I also see some rules where the right-hand side is a single symbol preceded by something. Wait, no, in the given grammar, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals. Wait, no, looking again: there are rules like NT0 \u2192 NT70 NT80, yes. And others, but I think all right-hand sides are two symbols, either non-terminals or possibly sometimes a single terminal. Wait, no, wait: for example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, both non-terminals. Wait, but I also see NT22 \u2192 't15', which is a terminal. Similarly, NT80 \u2192 't26', which is a terminal. So in the grammar, some productions produce a terminal, meaning that in the parse tree, these would be leaves.\n\nSo, the parse starts at S, and we need to build a parse tree where each node is either a non-terminal (which expands to two non-terminals) or a terminal.\n\nGiven the string is a series of terminals, to generate it, each non-terminal in the parse tree must expand into the corresponding terminal sequence in order.\n\nWait, no, the string is the leftmost derivation. So each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal, building the string from the start to the end.\n\nBut with the string being quite long, it's challenging to parse manually. So perhaps I can try to find if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see how the string can be constructed. Looking at the string: t35 t6 t24 t5 t10 t24 t37 t20 t8 t35 t37 t22 t9 t35 t36 t35 t8 t35 t6 t37 t10 t37 t15 t12 t2 t32 t26 t24 t36 t26 t24 t24 t14 t37 t41 t34 t22.\n\nWait, the first symbol is t35, which is the terminal. So I need to find a production that ends with t35. Looking at the grammar, I can see that NT9 has a production to NT72 and t23. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 \u2192 t25.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I can see NT6 \u2192 t25. So if the string starts with t35, maybe a production starting with NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, then NT72 might produce something ending in t23. Wait, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to convert the grammar into a pushdown automaton or use the recursive descent parsing method, but given that this is time-consuming, maybe I can think of the string as being built by following the productions.\n\nWait, let me look for the initial productions again. S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string must start with the concatenation of the expansions of NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35. So either NT9 expands to something starting with t35, or NT5 does.\n\nLooking at NT9, maybe NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. NT72 might expand to something else, perhaps leading to t23. Alternatively, NT9 could have multiple productions; let me check.\n\nIn the given grammar: NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Let's see where NT92 could lead. Wait, NT72 \u2192 t35, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me list all the non-terminals and their productions to see how the string can be formed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for the string starting from the end. But since the grammar is leftmost, that's more complex.\n\nAnother approach: break the string into chunks that correspond to the productions. Since each production can expand into two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals), perhaps each part of the string can be considered as a pair, representing the leftmost expansion.\n\nBut the string has 48 symbols, so each production that results in terminals contributes one token, while each that results in non-terminals would require further expansion. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to see if the string can be represented as a sequence of productions expanding from S.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the first two symbols in the string must be the expansions of NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t35. Suppose NT9 produces t35, then NT5 would produce the next part. Or if NT9 produces a non-terminal, then NT5 must produce the next symbol.\n\nWait, but if S \u2192 NT9 NT5, then NT9 must produce something that starts with t35, which is in the first position. So maybe NT9 has a production where the leftmost symbols start with t35.\n\nLooking through the productions for NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nLooking for what NT72 produces. NT72 has a production \u2192 t35, that's a terminal. So perhaps NT72 \u2192 t35.\n\nSo if NT72 \u2192 t35, then NT9 \u2192 t35 NT23. Then the first symbol t35 would come from NT9, and the next symbol would be the expansion of NT23.\n\nWait, but the first symbol is t35, and the next is t6. So after NT9 gives t35, NT5 would have to produce t6. Let me check if NT5 has a production that starts with t6.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc. Wait, NT5 \u2192 t26? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar: NT26 \u2192 t14. So NT26 is a non-terminal that produces t14.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT9 NT5. If NT9 \u2192 t35 NT23, then NT5 would have to produce what? If the next symbol is t6, then NT5 would have to produce t6, but looking at the grammar, does NT5 have a production to a terminal?\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't see an NT5 production that produces a terminal directly. All NT5's productions seem to produce non-terminals. So if NT5 can't produce a terminal, then the next symbol after the expansion of NT9 must be part of NT5's expansion.\n\nWait, that's the issue. If NT9 produces t35, which is the first symbol, then the next symbol would be the first symbol of NT5's expansion.\n\nBut NT5's productions all start with non-terminals. So perhaps the production NT5 produces something that starts with t6.\n\nBut looking, do any of NT5's productions start with a terminal? For instance, looking at NT52: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc. Hmm, seems all NT5... are non-terminals. Wait, no, I think I might have missed something.\n\nWait, let me go back. In the grammar, do any of the non-terminals when expanded result in a single terminal symbol?\n\nLooking at the grammar:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the rules don't have 't35' as a terminal; instead, some non-terminals map to 't' followed by a number. So 't35' would correspond to a non-terminal that maps to it. Hmm, but looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that directly produce 't35'. Wait, did I miss that? Let me check again: the rules include NT2 \u2192 t6, NT66 \u2192 t3, NT22 \u2192 t15 or t34, NT4 \u2192 t35, etc. Oh, wait! I see NT4 \u2192 't35'. So 't35' is the production of NT4.\n\nSo the first token is 't35', which must come from NT4. Then, the next token is 't6', which must come from some NT. Looking, I see NT9 leads to 't24' but wait, NT70 \u2192 't78' and 't28', but wait, looking for 't6', I see NT12 \u2192 t10, and NT88 \u2192 t5, but wait, where is 't6'? Wait, NT24 isn't in the rules, but wait no, the terminals are specific. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, I see NT22 maps to 't15' and 't9', but 't6' is a terminal in another rule. Wait, looking through, I see NT66 \u2192 't3', NT64 \u2192 't23', NT10 \u2192 't26', but where is 't6'? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, looking at the rules, is there any NT that directly maps to 't6'? Let me go through each rule and see.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT827056's production maps to 't6', but no, wait: the rules list many, but let me scan. For NT6, I don't see any rule, but wait, looking through, I see NT66 \u2192 t3, NT10 \u2192 t26, NT80 \u2192 t26, etc. Wait, where is 't6'? Oh, maybe I misread. Wait, the rule NT6 \u2192 't25' is there, but that's 't25' not 't6'. Similarly, NT13 \u2192 t31, NT8 \u2192 t2, etc. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the rules. Let me check again. Scanning through the rules, perhaps I'm missing a 't6' somewhere. Let me see: looking for any terminal 't' followed by a number. I see:\n\nNT26 \u2192 t14, NT64 \u2192 t23, NT66 \u2192 t3, NT22 \u2192 t15, etc. Hmm, I'm not seeing 't6' as a terminal in any of the rules. That's a problem because the first token is 't35', which needs to come from NT4, but then the next token is 't6', which would need to come from some NT that has a production ending with 't6'. But if none of the non-terminals map to 't6', then how can the string start with 't6'? That suggests the string is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misreading the grammar. Let me check the rules again. The rules are listed as:\n\nNT22 -> t15\nNT22 -> t9\nNT22 -> t34\nWait, no, looking back, the rules are part of the 'grammar' block, so for example, 'NT22 -> t15' etc. Wait, no\u2014the rules are more like NT22 -> NT93 NT22, etc., but the ones that directly produce 't' must be found.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the rules carefully. Looking for any production that ends with a terminal, which in the grammar, it's given as various 'tX' where X is a number.\n\nFor instance, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t15, t9, t34\n- Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me see the rules again:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT55 \u2192 't20'\n- NT95 \u2192 't79' and others\n- NT73 \u2192 't34'\nWait, perhaps 't6' isn't present at all, so the string cannot be generated. But wait, the string starts with 't35', 't6', etc., but if no NT directly produces 't6', then 't6' cannot be part of the generated string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I overlooked a rule that produces 't6'. Let me check again. Looking at all the 'tX' rules:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT22 \u2192 t34\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT55 \u2192 t20\n- NT89 \u2192 t72\n- NT72 \u2192 t35\n- NT73 \u2192 t34\n- NT78 \u2192 t40\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT80 \u2192 t26\n- NT70 \u2192 t78\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n- NT64 \u2192 t23\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT36 \u2192 t41\n- NT56 \u2192 t37\n- NT82 \u2192 t6\n- Wait, here's one: NT82 \u2192 t6?\n\nWait, looking at the rules, under NT82: NT82 -> t6 ... So yes, NT82 can produce 't6' as the first symbol. So, the first symbol 't35' must come from NT4, but then the next symbol 't6' must come from NT82.\n\nBut wait, then after that, how does it proceed? Because if 't35' is from NT4, and 't6' is from NT82, but the original grammar is in CNF, which requires each production to split the non-terminal into two. So for a string like 't35 t6 t24 t24 t8 ...', each token is a result of a sequence of productions, reducing from a single non-terminal.\n\nWait, but in context-free grammars, the entire string must be generated by expanding a single non-terminal through multiple steps. So, the string is a series of symbols derived from a single start symbol S. But the given string starts with 't35 t6...'. Since the grammar starts from S, perhaps the string can be generated if it can be traced back to S through the production rules.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed top-down, checking each symbol.\n\nLet me try building the parse tree.\n\nThe first symbol is 't35', which must come from NT4. So, the initial symbol S must expand into NT4 and another non-terminal. Looking at the production S -> NT9 NT52. So S expands into NT9 and NT52.\n\nNow, NT9 expands into NT28 NT8, but wait, perhaps I should look at the production rules for each non-terminal. But this is going to be very long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the string starts with 't35', which is 't35' is from NT4,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-704","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is `t35 t24 t10 t24 t37 t20 t20 t14 t37 t41 t15 t26 t24 t24 t14 t24 t10 t41 t5 t25 t41 t40 t15 t4 t41 t8 t35 t25 t8 t9 t12 t22 t31 t32 t31 t22 t9 t22`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or directly with a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, all the rules seem to be in CNF since each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except where it ends with a terminal, like NT6 -> 't25', which is fine because that represents a direct derivation.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if there's a path through the grammar that can produce this exact sequence. Essentially, I'm looking for a derivation that starts with the start symbol S and ends with this string.\n\nI'll start by checking if the first symbol in the string, 't35', can be derived from any of the starting symbols. The start symbol is S, so I need to see the productions from S. The only production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT52. So, the first step is S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nNow, that splits the string into two parts: the left part (NT9) and the right part (NT52). Each part will need to be produced from their respective non-terminals.\n\nLet's take the left part, NT9. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So, NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. Now, I need to check if NT72 can produce 't35' and NT23 can produce 't24'. Wait, in the string, the first symbol after S is 't35', but in this split, the first part is NT9, which is followed by NT72 NT23. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the string step by step, ensuring that each symbol is produced correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to reverse the string and use the CYK algorithm or check if the string can be generated by the grammar step by step, ensuring that each symbol is covered.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward method is to track the derivation process symbol by symbol.\n\nLet's try to parse the string backward, as that might be easier since the CYG algorithm typically works that way, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I'll try to see if each symbol can be connected through the grammar.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't35'. Looking at the grammar, which terminals can be directly derived. Scanning through each production, I notice that NT82 \u2192 't6' and NT35 \u2192 't40' comes from NT78, which is 't40'. Wait, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nWait, let's list all the direct terminal productions to see which terminals are available:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see:\n\nNT82 \u2192 't6' \n\nNT26 \u2192 't15' \n\nNT8 \u2192 't2' \n\nNT39 \u2192 't22' \n\nNT73 \u2192 't34' \n\nNT16 \u2192 't37' \n\nNT22 \u2192 't34' \n\nNT49 \u2192 't8' \n\nNT13 \u2192 't31' \n\nNT88 \u2192 't5' \n\nNT14 \u2192 't23' \n\nNT39 \u2192 't8' \n\nNT96 \u2192 't22' \n\nNT25 \u2192 't25' \n\nNT42 \u2192 't24' \n\nNT63 \u2192 't32' \n\nNT85 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nLooking at these, the string has a lot of 't's, but let me check each symbol:\n\nThe string starts with t35 t24 t10...\n\nLooking at t35, which comes from NT35. Checking which NT35 can be replaced. In the grammar, NT35 is part of several rules, but I see NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, NT42, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I should check how each terminal is generated.\n\nLet's list all the terminals and their possible non-terminals:\n\nFrom the productions, the terminals are:\n\nt35, t24, t10, t24, t37, t20, t20, t14, t37, t41, t15, t26, t24, t24, t14, t24, t10, t41, t5, t25, t41, t40, t15, t4, t41, t8, t35, t25, t8, t9, t12, t22, t31, t32, t31, t22, t9, t22.\n\nWait, but when looking at the grammar, none of these terminals except t35, t24, t10, t24, t37, t20, t20, t14, t37, t41, t15, t26, etc., are in the productions. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the left-hand sides are non-terminals, and the right-hand sides are combinations of non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 't25' is a terminal. So, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal.\n\nSo, the possible terminals that can be generated directly are:\n\nt25 (from NT25),\n\nt15 (from NT22 and NT66),\n\nt4 (from NT15 and NT13),\n\nt24 (from NT42 and NT24),\n\nt34 from NT22, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminals that can be directly derived:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT10 \u2192 't26'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT24 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\n\nNT28 \u2192 't15'\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, which leads to 't35' in NT72?\n\nWait, maybe it's better to build a table of which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\n\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nNT22 is also a rule? Wait, NT22 appears in two productions: NT22 \u2192 't10' and NT22 \u2192 't34'. So, depending on how the grammar is structured.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but perhaps I can proceed step by step.\n\nGiven that the first symbol is 't35', which is part of NT35. In the grammar, NT35 can be derived from NT42 and NT87.\n\nBut how does NT42 produce 't24'? NT42 \u2192 't24' is one of the productions. So, if NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, and NT42 \u2192 't24', and NT87 can produce 't35', then that part works.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nLooking at the string: t35 comes first, so the first two symbols would have to come from the first two non-terminals derived from S \u2192 NT9 NT52.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT9 NT52, so the string is [terminals from NT9] [terminals from NT52].\n\nBut the first symbol is 't35' which is part of NT9's children. NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So, NT72 and NT23 need to produce 't35' and 't24' respectively.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's 't35 t24', so the first symbol is 't35', which would come from NT72, and the second symbol 't24' from NT23.\n\nLooking at NT72: let's see its productions. From the grammar, I don't immediately see an NT72 \u2192 ... production, but perhaps it's an intermediate in another rule. Wait, does NT78 \u2192 't40' and NT78 is split into NT51 and NT95.

An alternative approach is to use the Sall-E-N method or recursive descent parsing, but given the time constraints, I'll try a step-by-step approach.\n\nI'll start by identifying the start symbol, S, and the productions that directly produce terminals. For example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT66 \u2192 't3', etc. However, most of these rules have non-terminals on the RHS, so they aren't helpful directly.\n\nI can look for the highest-level productions and see which ones can generate parts of the string. The initial symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so the root of the parse tree would have two children: NT9 and NT5. So the first two tokens generated by NT9 and NT5 should match the beginning of the string.\n\nLooking at NT9, what productions do we have? Scanning through the grammar rules, I see NT9 can go to NT72 NT23, NT91? Wait, but looking back, the grammar provided doesn't have NT91. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT93 has several productions, but not NT91. Wait, in the grammar, the rule for NT9 is: NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. \n\nSo starting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the first two symbols should be the parts derived from NT9 and NT5. So the first token after S is NT9, which produces NT72 NT23. Then, NT5 is another production.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is 't35'. So the root of the parse tree is S, which produces NT9 (which goes to NT72 NT23) and NT5 (which presumably goes to something that produces 't35').\n\nWait, let me confirm the initial split. S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string starts with 't35', which would be the production of NT9. So NT9 \u2192 ... How?\n\nLooking at the NT9 entries:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT9 is defined as:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nSo NT9 is just a single production, splitting into NT72 and NT23. Neither of these seems to produce a terminal directly, except further down the chain.\n\nSo to get a terminal 't35', we need the expansion of NT72 or NT23 to produce 't35'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at NT72 \u2192 't35'. Yes, there's a production NT72 \u2192 't35'. So that's perfect. So the first part of the string starts with 't35' as the expansion of NT72, which comes from NT9.\n\nNow, after NT72, the next symbol is NT23. Let's look at NT23's productions. From the grammar, NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22. \n\nSo NT23 splits into NT93 and NT22. Now, the next token is 't24'. Let's see which of these (NT93 or NT22) can produce 't24'.\n\nLooking at NT22 \u2192 't15', and NT93 \u2192 various productions. One of them is NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14, another is NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42, and so on. None of these directly produce 't24'. However, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the initial expansion was S \u2192 NT9 NT5. The first token is 't35', which comes from NT9 (NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23). Then, the next token is 't24', which must come from NT23. But NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22. So the expansion would be NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22. \n\nNow, the next token after 't35' is 't24', which would be from NT22, since NT22 \u2192 't15'. Wait, no, because NT22 alone produces 't15', but here we have NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22, and then the tokens are 't24' followed by 't24'. So perhaps the problem is that the next token is 't24', which would require that the next symbol is produced by the NT22, which only produces 't15'. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial breakdown. Let's try again.\n\nThe initial string starts with 't35 t24 t24 t20...', so the first symbol is 't35', which comes from NT9 via NT72 \u2192 't35'. Then the next symbol is 't24', which must come from the NT23 since NT23's expansion is NT93 NT22. But NT22 can only produce 't15', not 't24'. So that would be a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial split isn't S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Maybe I'm wrong in that. Let me double-check the grammar:\n\nThe start symbol is S, which \u2192 NT9 NT5. So yes, S splits into NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT5: from the grammar, NT5 has several productions, like NT5 \u2192 NT22 NT16, NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25, etc. Wait, no, NT5 is a different rule. Looking back through the grammar:\n\nI'm looking for NT5. Scanning through, I see:\n\nWait, looking at the productions, the line is 'NT22 \u2192 't15'' etc., so I might have confused NT5 with NT22. Wait, in the grammar, let's find NT5.\n\nWait, no, the grammar includes NT52 \u2192 ... etc. Looking for the start symbol's productions:\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to list out all the productions that start with each non-terminal.\n\nLet's list the productions for each NT:\n\nNT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nNT72:\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n\nSo when NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23, the next symbols after 't35' would be 't24', as 't24' is the next token, so NT23 must produce 't24'. But looking at NT23, it \u2192 NT93 NT22. Now, NT22 produces 't15'.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me structure this properly.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStart with the entire string and see if it can be matched to the start symbol S.\n\nThe string is:\nt35 t24 t24 t20 t6 t24 t24 t40 t15 t4 t35 t4 t4 t12 t8 t31 t32 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t20 t10 t2 t25 t41 t15 t26 t20 t40 t15 t26 t10 t4 t35 t34 t35\n\nWe need to see if this can be derived starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo the first two symbols must come from NT9 and NT5.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 (from the grammar)\n\nSo the first two symbols after the start are 't35' (from NT72) and then whatever comes from NT23.\n\nBut the next token is 't24'. So after 't35', 't24' must come from NT23.\n\nNow, NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22.\n\nNT93 has multiple productions: let's see:\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42, NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14, etc.\n\nThen NT22 \u2192 't15'.\n\nWait, so the expansion would be"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-720","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, and I have to figure out if the string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF is a specific form of CFGs where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC, A \u2192 a, or S \u2192 \u03b5 (the start symbol can produce the empty string). In this grammar, I notice that the start symbol S has a production S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which is of the form S \u2192 AB, where A and B are non-terminals. Then each of these non-terminals further split into other non-terminals or terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the productions, many of them are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, continuing the pattern. Some of them are terminal productions, where NTx is produced by a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe given string is: `t35 t41 t15 t22 t4 t25 t41 t34 t24 t6 t37 t6 t12 t24 t31 t37 t14 t37 t41 t20 t8 t35 t6 t24 t5 t24 t34 t12 t8 t31 t32 t26 t22 t34 t26 t37 t23 t34 t35`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, we can simulate the derivation process step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the initial split is into two parts: NT9 and NT5. Each of these needs to derive a sequence that matches the given string.\n\nLet's break down NT9 and NT5:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5. Then NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88. Each of these can further split:\n- NT27 is a terminal (from the grammar) as it maps to 't27'.\n- NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT4. Wait, looking at the grammar, NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT42, no. Wait, let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking back, the productions for NT88: in the grammar, I see NT42 \u2192 't42'. Wait, no, looking more carefully, I see lines like NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13. Or perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Wait, no, let me look:\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13. So that's an A \u2192 BC production.\n\nSo, starting with NT9:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88.\n\nNT27 is a terminal 't27'.\n\nNT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13.\n\nNow, NT21 and NT13:\n\nNT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70? Or wait, looking at the productions:\n\nLooking for NT21: I see NT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27 (not helpful), wait, wait, actually, for NT21, is there a production? Looking back, I see:\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22.\n\nWait, not directly NT21. Or perhaps looking:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT21 in the string but I can't find a production for NT21 in the grammar. Wait, let me check the grammar rules.\n\nSearching the grammar for NT21:\n\nLooking through all the productions, I don't see NT21 \u2192 anything. Wait, then NT21 is a terminal? But in the string, there is a 't21' in the string. Wait, looking at the string: `... t35 ... t21 ...`. So at position 21, there's a 't21'.\n\nBut in the grammar, is there a rule that defines NT21? Let me check the production list.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any rule where NT21 is on the left-hand side. So perhaps NT21 is a terminal. If that's the case, then 't21' in the string must be matched by NT21 directly. But if NT21 doesn't have a production, that would be a problem. Wait, but the initial string has 't21', but in the grammar, perhaps NT21 is a terminal.\n\nWait, let me verify. If NT21 doesn't have a production, it must be a terminal. Therefore, 't21' in the string must match NT21's production, which is just 't21'. That is, NT21 \u2192 't21'.\n\nSimilarly, in NT13: looking at the productions, I don't see NT13 on the left. So NT13 is also a terminal. Therefore, 't13' must be NT13's production.\n\nBut wait, in the string, there is a 't21' and a 't13' at certain positions. So that's acceptable.\n\nBut then, let me step back and model the derivation. Let's see:\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5.\n\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88.\n\nNT27 is 't27', NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13.\n\nNow, NT21 \u2192 't21' (since no production for NT21), and NT13 \u2192 't13' (no production, so terminal).\n\nSo the current production is t27 t21 t13.\n\nNow, the string up to this point is: t35 t41 t15 t22 t4 t25 t41 t34 t24 t6 t37 t6 t12 t24 t31 t37 t14 t37 t41 t20 t8 t35 t6 t24 t5 t24 t34 t12 t8 t31 t32 t26 t22 t34 t26 t37 t23 t34 t35.\n\nWait, no, the string is the entire string provided. So wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should model the entire string as a sequence derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the entire string as a series of applications starting from S.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model this as the string being a sequence of tokens, and try to greedily match them from left to right, splitting the string into parts that match the non-terminals.\n\nIn CNF, the steps involve splitting the string into two parts at each step, where each part is derived from a non-terminal. So this is similar to recursive parsing.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the string as a list of tokens, and try to find a way to split it into left and right parts, each of which can be derived from the non-terminals generated by S.\n\nLet me try to process the string in parts.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt35, t41, t15, t22, t4, t25, t41, t34, t24, t6, t37, t6, t12, t24, t31, t37, t14, t37, t41, t20, t8, t35, t6, t24, t5, t24, t34, t12, t8, t31, t32, t26, t22, t34, t26, t37, t23, t34, t35.\n\nI need to see if this can be built up starting from S.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT9 NT5, the string should start with NT9's derivation and then NT5's.\n\nSo first, the string should be split into two parts, each derived from NT9 and NT5 respectively.\n\nLooking at the start: the first token is t35. Let's see if that can be matched by NT9.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT16 NT5.\n\nSo NT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88.\n\nNT27 is 't27', NT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13.\n\nNT21 is 't21', NT13 is 't13'.\n\nSo NT9's production would yield t27 t21 t13. But the string starts with t35, not t27. Therefore, this seems mismatched.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So NT9 would produce t27 t21 t13, but the string starts with t35. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a longer derivation for NT9. Let me check further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, perhaps NT9 has other productions. From the list, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 (but that's a different NT95).\n\nLooking back, let me list all the productions where the left-hand side could be NT9.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nI see:\n\n- NT9"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The non-terminals are all the other identifiers like NT22, S, etc.\n\nNow, the string starts with t35. Let me trace possible paths through the grammar.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the production for S is two non-terminals followed by no terminal, meaning the first step will produce two symbols. However, the string starts with a single 't35', which is a terminal, so I must see if 't35' can be directly derived from either NT9 or NT5.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT9: I don't see an explicit rule for NT9 in the given grammar except in some productions like NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83, which may relate to NT9. Wait, let me check all possible NT9 productions.\n\nLooking through the production list, I see that there are NT89, NT78, NT23, etc., but no direct production for NT9 \u2192 something. Hmm, maybe I can infer it from another production. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, NT9 appears as the left-hand side in some productions:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83\n- NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\n- NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n- NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\n- etc.\n\nWait, no direct production for NT9. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see:\n\n- NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83\n- NT9 appears only on the right-hand side, but not as a left-hand side in any of the rules except S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nWait, so S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and the first symbol is T35. So I need to see if either NT9 or NT5 can produce T35.\n\nLooking for NT5 productions: NT5 is in the productions as S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so NT5 is only mentioned on the right side. In the grammar, the only production for NT5 is when S produces NT9 NT5. So NT5 is a terminal? But looking at the productions, NT5 has no entries on the right-hand side except as part of S.\n\nWait, no, looking at all the production rules, NT5 doesn't have a production. The only place it appears is as NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5. So perhaps NT5 is a terminal?\n\nSimilarly, looking at the list of terminals: in the grammar, NT5 is present as a terminal? Wait, in the given production list, I'm looking for NT5 on the right-hand side.

{"custom_id":"request-744","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t35 t37 t37 t20 t8 t24 t24 t20 t10 t2 t25 t41 t15 t24 t40 t15 t26 t35 t37 t37 t40 t10 t26 t37 t8 t9 t3 t4 t15 t22 t26 t24 t24 t6 t12 t2 t32 t4 t23 t34 t22`.\n\nFirst, I should recall that a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) has each production rule of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. It can also include the empty string, but in this case, it doesn't look like there's an epsilon production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all production rules except for the ones starting with NT22 are non-terminals leading to terminals. Wait, no, actually, the grammar consists of non-terminals on the left, and each production decomposes them into other non-terminals or into terminals with no other symbols. Wait, some produce two non-terminals, others produce a non-terminal and a terminal, no, actually no: looking back, the grammar is in CNF, so each production is either a non-terminal or has two non-terminals on the right. But wait, no: in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal going to two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production on the right-hand side can't have more than two symbols, and in the case of two, both are non-terminals. But looking at the rules, I see some rules have a terminal. Wait, no, perhaps the grammar actually has productions where a non-terminal can expand into a terminal followed by a non-terminal, or two non-terminals, or a terminal and a non-terminal. But that's against CNF because CNF requires each right-hand side to be either two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps the user made a mistake, or perhaps the grammar includes productions that are not in CNF. Wait, the initial message said it's in Chomsky normal form, so each production should be a single non-terminal \u2192 two non-terminals. Let me check the given grammar to confirm.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each production's right-hand side is either a single non-terminal or two non-terminals, not terminals. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. All other productions like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc., seem to be two non-terminals. So yes, this is in CNF.\n\nIn that case, to parse a string, we need to break the string into symbols that correspond to the production steps. Each step in the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two other symbols. So the initial step is to check if the entire string can be derived by repeatedly applying the productions.\n\nBut since the grammar is given and we need to check production steps, perhaps we can use a method like recursive descent parsing or some form of top-down parsing, constructing parse trees. Alternatively, we can try to break down the string into components that match the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the better approach is to look for sequences in the string that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions. For example, each production like NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35 would correspond to the string segment \"t35 t37 t37\", etc. Wait, but no, because in the grammar, each production is a single non-terminal expanding into two others. So each production can be viewed as replacing a symbol with two symbols. So, each token in the string might represent a non-terminal, and the sequence must match the productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the given string is a linear sequence of symbols, and each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal in the grammar. So each symbol (like t35, t37) represents a non-terminal, and the string as a whole must correspond to a sequence that matches the grammar.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if the string is a valid parse of the grammar. To do that, I can try to construct a parse tree from the string, using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first few tokens of the string and see if I can find which productions they could match.\n\nThe first token is t35. So I need to find a production that has t35 as the expansion. Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT where the production ends with t35.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87\n- NT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56\n- NT63 \u2192 NT27 NT43\n- NT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95\n- NT87 \u2192 NT56 NT36\n- NT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\n- NT73 \u2192 NT4 NT13\n- NT27 \u2192 't24' (so this would be the terminal)\nOthers like NT35: Let's see.\n\nWait, but in our case, the symbols like t35, t37, etc., are terminals, while the NTxx are non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me rephrase: The string consists of symbols like t35, t37, etc., which are terminals, and perhaps other symbols like NT9, NT5, etc., which are non-terminals. But wait, no, the grammar's productions are non-terminals \u2192 two non-terminals or a single terminal. So perhaps in the given grammar, some non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see some right-hand sides have an explicit terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't35'\n\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\n\nNT64 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT14 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\n\nNT8 \u2192 't2'\n\nNT86 \u2192 't34'\n\nAnd more. So some non-terminals can produce a single terminal symbol. The others produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo in this case, the string is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a symbol that could be a terminal production from a non-terminal.\n\nSo the strategy is to parse the string as a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, trying to find a way to expand non-terminals into two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal (as allowed by the grammar).\n\nWait, no, each production is of the form NT \u2192 XY, where X and Y are non-terminals, or X and Y are terminals, or one terminal and one non-terminal. But in our case, the grammar only has productions where X and Y are non-terminals, except for cases where a non-terminal produces a single terminal, which would be the base case.\n\nSo the parsing can be approached by:\n\nStart with the overall string, break it down according to possible leftmost or rightmost productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to start with a top-down approach, trying to match the start symbol.\n\nWait, the start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the expansion of S: S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo S is non-terminal NT9 followed by NT5.\n\nEach of these NT9 and NT5 can be further expanded. Let's see:\n\nNT9: productions like NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar:\n\nFrom the initial set, the productions for NT9 start with:\n\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT53 (Wait, no, wait, looking at the grammar:\n\nWait, the initial list of grammar productions:\n\nLooking for NT9 and NT93.\n\nWait, looking through all productions:\n\nWait, checking the grammar:\n\nIn the grammar, there's:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n\nAlso, NT69 \u2192 NT85 NT52\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to look for possible production steps that could break down the string.\n\nSo the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the string must start with the expansion of NT9 followed by NT5.\n\nSo, let's look at the first few symbols of the string: t35 t37 t37 t20 t8 t24 t24 t20 t10 t2 t25 t41 t15 t24...\n\nWait, assuming that the string starts with the first non-terminal expansion, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the string can be broken down step by step using the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to attempt to represent each symbol as either a terminal or a non-terminal and see if the sequence can be matched.\n\nLooking through the given grammar, some non-terminals can produce a single terminal symbol.

{"custom_id":"request-742","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, and the grammar consists of a series of production rules.\n\nTo start, I need to understand what each production rule means. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. This simplifies things a bit because the parse trees will be binary, and each symbol can be derived in a certain number of steps.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT9 NT5. So S is derived from NT9 and NT5. Both NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals, meaning they need to be further expanded.\n\nNext, I should map each token in the string to the non-terminals or terminals in the grammar. The string is: t35 t37 t20 t8 t24 t24 t8 t24 t5 t35 t37 t20 t40 t15 t26 t10 t37 t31 t24 t12 t24 t20 t5 t25 t41 t10 t41 t3 t14 t4 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t24 t5 t8 t15 t22.\n\nEach of these tokens is either a terminal, which matches directly from a production, or part of the non-terminal productions.\n\nFor example, let's take the first token 't35'. Looking over the grammar rules, there's a rule NT78 -> NT51 NT95, but that doesn't help directly. Wait, no, some production rules directly map non-terminals to terminals. For instance, NT35 -> 't4'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT36 -> 't41', NT10 -> 't26', NT56 -> 't36', NT15 -> 't4', etc. So 't35' might not be a direct production. Wait, actually, in the rules, there are several that map directly to 't's. Let me list them all:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT35 -> 't4' (from NT52 -> NT60 NT81, but that's two non-terminals. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look again.\n\nActually, in the provided rules, some are like NT66 -> 't3', NT12 -> 't10', NT22 -> 't34', etc. Others directly map to 't's. So I think each 't' token corresponds to a production that ends the derivation.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of 't's: t35, t37, t20, etc., and some of these may be part of longer productions. So to determine if the string is generated by the grammar, I need to check if each of these tokens can be derived from the start symbol by applying the production rules correctly.\n\nI think a good approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can expand it into the given string. Since this is a tree, each step expands non-terminals into pairs of other symbols or terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe 48 symbols, which translates to 2^48 possible derivation paths, which is impractical to check manually. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by starting at S and expanding each non-terminal step by step, matching the tokens in order. But since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals, expanding one after another. This can lead to overlapping productions, and each token in the string is either a terminal or the result of a production.\n\nBut in this case, all the tokens are 't's with numbers, which suggests that each token corresponds to a production that directly results in that terminal. So, in other words, each token in the string must be the result of a production rule where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side is the token or two non-terminals.\n\nWait, let's clarify: Each token in the string must be either a result of a direct production or an intermediate symbol that's expanded further. But since the grammar is given, and each production is in CNF, the only way the string can be generated is if the entire string is a sequence of terminals obtained by the correct expansions.\n\nSo, to test this, I can take the string and map each token to the corresponding production. For example, 't35' must correspond to a production of the form X -> 't35' where X is a non-terminal. Similarly for each token.\n\nSo, I'll list all the 't's and see if each corresponds to a production rule where that non-terminal is on the left-hand side and maps directly to that 't'.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's note those that directly expand to 't's:\n\nFrom the list:\n\n- NT66 -> 't3'\n- NT12 -> 't10'\n- NT22 -> 't34, t15, t9'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT84 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT39 -> 't22'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT63 -> 't32'\n- NT20 -> 't26'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT36 -> 't41'\n- NT10 -> 't26'\n- NT72 -> 't35'\n- NT78 -> 't40'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT88 -> 't5'\n- NT25 -> 't25'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT36 -> 't41'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT21 -> 't24, t10'\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list all NT rules and see which ones have 't's.\n\nLooking back, I realize that in the provided rules, there are a few that directly map non-terminals to 't's. For example:\n\n- NT84 -> 't5'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT28 -> 't10'\n- NT22 -> 't34', 't15', 't9'\n- NT26 -> 't14'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT8 -> 't2'\n- NT36 -> 't41'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT36 -> 't41' (duplicate)\n- NT64 -> 't23'\n- NT49 -> 't8'\n- NT13 -> 't31'\n- NT88 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT55 -> 't35'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT56 -> 't36'\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT22 -> 't15'\n- NT22 -> 't9'\n\nSo these are the NT rules that produce 't's directly. Each of these NTs, when derived, will produce a single 't' at the terminal level.\n\nNow, the given string is 48 tokens long (including all 't's and numbers). Each token must correspond to either a direct production to 't' or an intermediate step in a production that eventually produces a 't'.\n\nGiven that each production in CNF results in two symbols, the string's length implies that if all tokens were terminals, the string length would be 2^n, starting from n=1. 48 is not a power of two, so some tokens must be non-terminals that are further expanded.\n\nBut since the string is given, perhaps it's a sequence of terminals, meaning that each 't' must be a result of a direct production from a non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the problem says the string may or may not be in the language. We need to check if the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nAn alternative approach is to parse the string using the grammar, but that would involve checking each token and seeing if it can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's easier to see if each token in the string corresponds to a non-terminal that has a production to that token.\n\nFor example, let's take the first token: t35.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT72 -> 't35', NT4 -> 't35', and NT55 -> 't35'. So t35 can be produced by NT72, NT4, or NT55.\n\nSo the first token is okay.\n\nSimilarly, the next token is t37. Looking for NT rules that produce t37.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT78 -> 't40"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-769","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to check is quite long, and the grammar seems a bit complex. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts.\n\nFirst, Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. The start symbol S also leads into the first production. The given grammar seems to follow CNF because all the rules look like they produce either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of these terminals, each separated by spaces. I notice that some terminals are 't' followed by numbers, like 't35', 't24', etc., which I assume are part of the string's representation. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I think of the string as a derivation starting from the start symbol S. Each non-terminal in the string needs to be expanded according to the grammar rules until only terminals remain. If I can produce the exact string through such expansions, then the answer is 'Yes'; otherwise, it's 'No'.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't35'. The grammar rules that produce 't35' are:\n\n- NT78 \u2192 't35' (Production 15)\n- NT87 \u2192 't36' and NT14 \u2192 't23', which don't directly produce 't35'.\nWait, actually, I need to check all rules where the right-hand side (RHS) is a terminal. Let me scan through the grammar rules:\n\nFrom the grammar, I see:\n- NT78 \u2192 't40' (Production 17)\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (Production 61)\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (Production 80)\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (Production 87)\n- NT22 \u2192 't9' (Production 94)\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (Production 81)\n- KT6 etc., but I see that some non-terminals end with a terminal.\n\nWait, I might have misread the terminals. Let me look again. The terminals are 't' followed by a number, like 't35', so the correct grammar rules need to be identified where the RHS is 't35' or another terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT36 \u2192 't41' (Production 33), NT56 \u2192 't37' (Production 58), and NT10 \u2192 't26' (Production 47). Hmm, but none seem to produce 't35' directly. Wait, perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, let me list all the rules that produce terminals 't...':\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't35' (Production 74)\n- NT78 \u2192 't40' (Production 17)\n- NT6 \u2192 't25' (Production 61)\n- NT22 \u2192 't15' (Production 87)\n- NT22 \u2192 't9' (Production 94)\n- NT25 \u2192 't25' (Production 81)\n- NT15 \u2192 't4' (Production 80)\n- NT26 \u2192 't14' (Production 92)\n- NT80 \u2192 't26' (Production 48)\n- NT85 \u2192 't4' (Production 84)\n- NT84 \u2192 't5' (Production 58)\n- NT42 \u2192 't24' (Production 67)\n- NT70 \u2192 't72' ?

Checking the grammar:\n\nLooking for NT35 \u2192 something. Wait, no, the grammar doesn't have NT35. Instead, I see NT36 \u2192 't41' and other rules. Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for all productions where the RHS is a terminal starting with 't' and see which ones produce 't35', 't37', etc.\n\nLooking back, NT35 is not present as a non-terminal in any production, but maybe there are productions to 't35' through other non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing this. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this by trying to build the string step by step, starting from S and trying to expand symbols to get the string. Since the string is about 40 symbols long, this might take too long manually, but maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be broken down based on the given productions.\n\nAnother approach is to process the string from the end and see if it can be built backwards using the grammar. This is called a backward checking method.\n\nStarting with the last symbol, which is 't22'. Let's see which productions can produce 't22':\n\nLooking at the rules that end with 't22':\n\n- NT19 \u2192 't22' (Wait, I don't see NT19. Let me check the grammar list again.\n\nWait, the grammar rules are numbered, but perhaps it's better to find all rules that have RHS as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-784","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific rules: each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit that structure because all the rules on the left side have a single non-terminal, and the right side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5 is in CNF because it's splitting into two parts, both NT's, and NT22 \u2192 't15' is just a terminal, so that's fine too.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t35 t37 t20 t6 t35 t41 t6 t24 t5 t35 t37 t35 t40 t15 t26 t8 t37 t12 t2 t32 t26 t35 t24 t5 t35 t9 t6 t37 t6 t24 t12 t9 t22 t26 t10 t37 t36 t26 t37 t23 t9 t22`.\n\nI think the approach here is to use the CYK algorithm, which efficiently parses strings for CFGs in CNF. But before jumping into that, maybe I can get a high-level understanding. Alternatively, I can try to trace back from the start symbol S and see if I can derive the string.\n\nLet me list out the terminals and see what they correspond to. The terminals are things like 't35', 't20', etc. So each terminal is a leaf node in the parse tree. My goal is to see if the string can be formed by expanding the grammar until all non-terminals are resolved into terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, maybe I should look at each terminal and see where they can be generated. For instance, looking at 't35' in the string, let me see which productions produce 't35'. Scanning through the grammar, I see NT22 \u2192 't15', NT26 \u2192 't14', NT55 \u2192 't35' (from S \u2192 NT9 NT5). Wait, no, NT55 has multiple rules.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. So, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar has a start symbol S, and it's in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar, all the productions either directly produce a terminal or combine two non-terminals. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is: `t35 t6 t24 t10 t36 t20 t6 t37 t35 t24 t12 t24 t40 t15 t35 t23 t22 t5 t25 t41 t35 t40 t15 t26 t10 t24 t12 t10 t36 t20 t34 t25 t37 t41 t10 t31 t34 t25 t4 t10 t36 t34 t35`. \n\nI notice that the string consists of a bunch of tokens starting with 't' followed by numbers. From the grammar, these tokens like t35, t24, etc., are the terminal symbols. So, the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nThe approach to solving this is usually to use a parsing method, like checking through the grammar by applying the productions recursively to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, I can use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, I can try to see if each token in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, it's more efficient to look for the start symbol S and see how it can derive the string. The start symbol is S, which produces NT9 NT5. So S \u2192 NT9 NT5. That means S is a non-terminal that can be split into two parts, each of which can be non-terminals or terminals.\n\nEach terminal token in the string must match a production rule that produces a single terminal. So, for example, 't35' might be produced by a specific rule. Let's see if there's a rule that directly produces 't35' or if it's part of a larger non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\nNT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\nNT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66\n... and so on.\n\nWait, but all these seem to be non-terminal productions. So none of the non-terminals directly produce a 't' terminal except some might have rules that end with a 't'.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar again, I see some rules that result in terminals, like:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nNT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28\n... etc.\n\nBut do any of these directly produce an 't' terminal? Or does any rule produce a terminal starting with 't'? Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nFor example, NT22 \u2192 't15', NT22 \u2192 't9', NT22 \u2192 't34', etc. Similarly for others.\n\nWait, but in the string we're evaluating, the terminals start with 't35', 't6', etc. So no rule in the grammar directly produces 't35' as a single terminal. That doesn't make sense because in context-free grammars, terminals are the basic symbols, so they should have productions that end in terminals.\n\nWait, hold on. I'm misinterpreting the grammar. The grammar consists of all the rules except for the last lines where the non-terminals are replaced by terminals. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the first part of the grammar, all lines are of the form X \u2192 Y Z, meaning they are non-terminals combining two other non-terminals. Then, starting from 'NT22 -> 't15'' and onwards, the non-terminals can directly produce a terminal string.\n\nSo, for example, NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', 't34', etc. Similarly, NT6 can produce 't25', and NT15 -> 't4' and so on.\n\nBut wait, the 't's like 't35' appear in the string. Let me check if any non-terminal produces 't35' via a rule. Looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT56 -> NT36 NT95, which in turn uses NT36 and NT95. NT95 might lead to something, but in the rules starting towards the end, NT22 is a terminal, but others like NT35 -> NT42 NT87, etc. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't' terminals are always one symbol long, so each token in the string corresponds to exactly one production rule in the grammar.\n\nSo, for example, 't35' must be produced by a rule where NT35 \u2192 't35'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any direct 't35' productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some. Let's check.\n\nIn the grammar, the terminal rules start from 'NT22 -> 't15'', 't9', 't34'' etc. Looking through each line:\n\nLooking at NT22, NT23, NT24, etc.\n\nWait, for NT6: NT66 -> 't3', NT6 -> 't25', NT64 -> 't23', NT66 -> 't4', NT60 -> 't12', NT82 -> 't6', etc.\n\nLooking for terminals starting with 't35':\n\nLooking at the end of the grammar lines:\n\nNT35's productions are not present as terminal rules. Wait, but looking through the list, I don't see any production for NT35 that ends with a terminal. Wait, let me check each of the grammar rules:\n\nThe grammar rules are split between non-terminals and terminals. So for example, NT66 is a non-terminal that can be replaced by 't3' and 't4'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, terminal symbols are those that are followed by '-> 't' or other single-letter terminals. So, each production either ends in '->' followed by a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT55 -> 't20'\n\nNT42 -> 't24'\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nNT80 -> 't26'\n\nNT56 -> 't36'\n\nNT10 -> 't26'\n\nNT72 -> 't35'\n\nNT78 -> 't40'\n\nNT6 -> 't25'\n\nNT15 -> 't4'\n\nNT2 -> 't6'\n\nNT66 -> 't3'\n\nWait, so:\n\n- NT72 \u2192 't35'\n\nYes, so 't35' is produced by NT72. Similarly, 't24' is produced by NT42.\n\nBut then, looking at the string again, 't35' is the first token. So, for the string to be generated, the start symbol S must have a derivation that includes these NTs leading to these terminals.\n\nThe start symbol S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then, each of NT9 and NT5 needs to be replaced and their terminals will appear in the string. So, let's see if NT9 can produce a 't35' terminal at the beginning.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is 't35', which would correspond to the first symbol produced by NT9, right? Because S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so NT9 would be the first part and NT5 the second.\n\nSo, for the string to start with 't35', NT9 must derive a string that starts with 't35'. Then, the next symbol should come from NT5.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting a bit complicated. Another approach is to try to see if the string can be broken down into the rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to model this as a memoization table, but that might take a lot of time. Instead, let's consider trying to see if each segment in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nLooking at the string: 't35 t6 t24 t10 ...'\n\nSo, starting with 't35', which is 't' followed by '35'. Looking through the grammar, 't35' corresponds to NT72. So, does NT9 \u2192 NT72 somehow? Or perhaps NT9 can produce something that leads to 't35'.\n\nWait, let's see NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23. So NT9 is composed of NT72 and NT23. NT72 \u2192 't35', so if NT23 can produce something that starts with 't6', for example.\n\nWait, in the string, after 't35' comes 't6', which is 't' followed by 6. Looking for a production that ends with 't6'.

{"custom_id":"request-807","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been presented with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF is a specific form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit CNF because each rule on the left side (like S, NT52, etc.) has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the rules that end with a terminal, like NT22 \u2192 't24'.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: `t35 t6 t37 t10 t24 t24 t12 t10 t36 t6 t12 t35 t37 t35 t20 t6 t24 t5 t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t10 t26 t22 t31 t34 t25 t26 t41 t35 t40 t10 t26 t24 t24 t5 t25 t41 t15 t35`. I notice that it's a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are terminal symbols.\n\nMy approach should be to try and parse the string from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can use a recursive descent parsing method or perhaps a bottom-up approach like the CYK algorithm. But since I'm just doing this manually, I'll try to see if the string can be generated starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar's start symbol, S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So S must produce a sequence of two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. Let me check if the string starts correctly.\n\nThe string starts with 't35', which would originate from a production of NT9 or NT5. Looking at the grammar, I see NT9 has rules that can lead to 't35'. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which eventually could lead to t41 or t35, but that's getting a bit complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first look for any tokens that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions. For S, the first step is to produce NT9 followed by NT5. So the string should start with the expansion of NT9 and then NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9, its production rules include things like NT93 \u2192 NT72 NT23, but I don't see an immediate rule that starts with 't35' directly. Wait, no\u2014 looking at the terminal symbols, I see NT6 \u2192 't25', NT15 \u2192 't4', etc. So perhaps I need to look for which non-terminals can directly produce the tokens in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should build a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string has 41 tokens (I think, let me count: 1+2+3+... each 't' separated by spaces). That's a lot. Let's consider that the string has to be completely consumed by the grammar starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that each production is length 2 (A \u2192 BC) or a terminal (A \u2192 a). So, for any given token, it can be either a terminal (like 't24') or a non-terminal that must be expanded further into two other non-terminals.\n\nGiven that, maybe I can try to work backwards from the string, looking for possible splits into two non-terminals. But manually parsing a string of 41 tokens is quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, I could look for the start symbol S \u2192 NT9 NT5 and check if the first token comes from NT9 and the next from NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 | NT69 NT5 | NT93 NT42 | NT78 NT23 | ... etc.\n\nSo NT9 can be split into two non-terminals. Let's see what terminal comes first. The first token is 't35'. So I need to see if NT9 can produce 't35' as a terminal. Looking through the grammar, I notice NT92 \u2192 NT44 NT56, but that's not helpful. Wait, I don't see NT9 directly producing 't35'. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see some NT rules that expand to terminals:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70\n- NT22 \u2192 NT93 NT22\n- NT28 \u2192 NT10 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT10 \u2192 't26'\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'? Wait, no\u2014 looking at NT95\u2192NT10 NT11, and then NT10\u2192't26', so NT95 would produce 't26' and whatever NT11 gives. Alternatively, maybe NT93 \u2192 't35'?\n\nWait, looking at the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT15 \u2192 't4'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 \u2192 't14', 't23'\n- NT55 \u2192 't35'\nWait, looking back, the grammar has NT55 \u2192 't35' in multiple places?\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 ... but not directly. Wait, let's look for terminals:\n\n- NT95 \u2192 't41'?\nWait, checking NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, which then becomes 't26' and ... but I don't see NT11 leading to a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's find all terminal symbols in the grammar. It seems that some NTs expand to terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT65 \u2192 Not sure; wait, looking through the list, I see NT22 \u2192 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT55 \u2192 't22', 't16', 't9' etc.\u2014 oh, wait, no\u2014 actually, looking through the list, I see:\n\nLooking for NT productions that result in terminals:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't25'\n- NT22 \u2192 't24' (from NT22 \u2192 't24'), wait, no\u2014 checking the grammar...\n\nWait, I see in the grammar:\n\nLooking for lines where the right-hand side is just 'tN' with N being a number.\n\nLet me go through the grammar lines:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't24'\u2014 yes, that's one.\nNT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70\u2014 not a terminal.\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\u2014 another.\nNT22 \u2192 't9'.\nNT55 \u2192 't22', 't16', 't9'?\nLooking at the grammar rules provided, I see:\n\n- NT64 \u2192 NT36 NT96\n- NT47? No, perhaps looking for any production that ends with a terminal.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the grammar, lines like:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT55 \u2192 't35' because in the grammar, I see NT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79, but also NT55 \u2192 't20' and 't16'? Wait, no, looking again:\n\nAh, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for lines where a NT rule ends with a terminal:\n\nFor example:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't24'\n- NT22 \u2192 't15'\n- NT22 \u2192 't9'\n- NT55 \u2192 't22'\n- NT55 \u2192 't16'\n- NT55 \u2192 't9'\n\nWait, yes.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the string to analyze its components. The string is a series of tokens separated by spaces: \"t35 t6 t24 t24 t20 t6 t24 t10 t4 t5 t34 t25 t26 t41 t20 t15 t22 t24 t12 t4 t23 t22 t4 t25 t41 t10 t26 t10 t4 t5 t34 t25 t3 t24 t9 t22\".

{"custom_id":"request-823","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure of the derivations. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It starts with a start symbol S, which directly produces NT9 NT5. Each of these non-terminals eventually eventually terminates into a string or produce other non-terminals. The entire string we're testing is a sequence of terminals, specifically 't' followed by a number. My job is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar.\n\nThe string is: \nt35 t37 t36 t20 t8 t37 t23 t22 t26 t24 t24 t6 t24 t24 t6 t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t10 t37 t31 t4 t8 t24 t10 t37 t40 t15 t4 t23 t22 t26 t24 t10 t36 t40 t10 t4 t23 t34 t22.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the possible structure. Each non-terminal in the grammar either expands into two other non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S -> NT9 NT5. So each step in the derivation is always two non-terminals. The string has 65 tokens, all terminals. Since each production in CNF splits into two, the length of the string must be 2^n where n is the number of steps. Wait, but 65 isn't a power of 2, so that might be an issue.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of steps in the derivation would lead to a parse tree where the number of leaves is something else. Each leftmost derivation step in CNF would produce a string of length 2^n. But our string isn't a power of 2, which immediately raises a red flag. For example, the first production from S gives us two non-terminals, so the string length must be a power of 2. 65 is not a power of 2, so that suggests the string can't be generated by this grammar. But I should verify this carefully.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The string is 65 tokens long. The initial non-terminal S expands into two non-terminals. Each of those can either expand into two non-terminals or a terminal. So the number of terminal symbols in the string must be 2^n, where n is the number of levels in the parse tree. 65 is not a power of 2 because 2^6=64 and 2^7=128, so 65 isn't a power of 2. Therefore, it's impossible for this grammar to generate a string of 65 terminals.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the grammar allows for more complex structures. Let me think again. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, but the count of terminals can vary depending on how many steps we take. But no, the count will always be 2^n. The string here has 65 terminals, which isn't a power of two. Hence, it can't be generated.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is No because the number of terminals in the string isn't a power of two, which is required for the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string to evaluate is a sequence of symbols ending with 't's and numbers, like 't35 t24 ...' up to several 't's. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF implies that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that all the production rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which means S can be replaced by NT9 followed by NT5. Then, NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, and so on.\n\nThe string to check is a series of these generated symbols, so each symbol in the string must come from a terminal production in the grammar or the result of combining non-terminals that eventually produce terminals.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.

Similarly, NT27 \u2192 't24', and other NTs like NT26 \u2192 't14', etc.\n\nSo, for NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, I need to see what NT42 and NT87 produce.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56, which are both non-terminals. Then NT12 \u2192 NT49 NT9, and NT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95, which are also non-terminals. So, NT42 can't produce a terminal directly; it can only produce more non-terminals. Therefore, NT35 can't directly produce a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT87 isn't directly a terminal. Let me check: NT87 is perhaps produced by NT14 \u2192 't23' and others, but looking back, I don't see NT87 as a terminal production. Wait, no, in the productions, only certain NTs end up producing terminal symbols. For example, NT27 \u2192 't24', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, to get 't35', I think NT35 must produce it. Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule where NT35 is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-841","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left and two on the right, or a single terminal. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I'll need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So, the string must start with the sequences generated by NT9 and NT5. Let me write these down for clarity.\n\nThe given string is: t35 t6 t24 t10 t24 t34 t24 t6 t24 t10 t41 t14 t37 t41 t6 t35 t36 t35 t40 t10 t26 t10 t37 t31 t31 t35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t24 t5 t40 t10 t26 t6 t24 t12 t34 t22 t31 t10 t36 t9 t22.\n\nFirst step: The first part of the string is t35 followed by t6, t24. Let me check the rules for NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 has the rule NT9 -> NT72 NT23. So, after the initial NT9, it must produce NT72 and NT23. Then, NT23 has a production NT23 -> NT93 NT22. \n\nSo, starting from S, the first two symbols should be from NT9 and NT5. Let's see:\n\n- The first symbol is t35. Let's see if NT9 can produce t35.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, NT9 has:\nNT9 -> NT72 NT23.\n\nSo, the derivation starts as S \u2192 NT9 NT5 \u2192 NT9 *NT5. NT9 will produce the first part, NT5 will produce the second part.\n\nLet me analyze each part.\n\nStarting with NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23.\nSo the first part after S is NT72 NT23.\n\nBut the first symbol in the string is t35. Looking at the grammar rules, where does t35 come from?\n\nLooking through the rules, t35 is produced by certain non-terminals. Let's see:\n\nNT36 \u2192 NT41 NT23 (Wait, no, NT35 is a terminal. Wait, looking back, the rules for NT35:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I'm noticing that some Nts are terminals. For example, NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11, and those Nts produce 't's.\n\nLooking for where t35 comes from. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking for any production that leads to t35. Looking at NT78 \u2192 t40, which is 't40', not t35. Looking for more.\n\nWait, I'm looking at the string, the first symbol is t35. So I need to find a production for NT9 that could lead to t35.\n\nLooking at NT72: NT72 \u2192 NT24 NT23 and something else? Wait, checking the rules:\n\nWait, I'm trying to see where t35 is used as a terminal. For example, NT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52, which then may produce t's. Wait, perhaps I should list all the direct terminal productions to see which Nts lead to t's.\n\nLooking through the rules, here are all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t70 (Wait, no, in the rules, I see NT70 -> NT78 NT28, etc. Hmm, no, wait the rules show NT78 -> t40, but that's not a direct terminal.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me go through the rules step by step.\n\nLooking through the rules, for each NT, check if it's a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nThe grammar seems to have some Nts that produce two terminals. For example:\n\nWait, looking at the rules, some Nts have productions that result in terminals:\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16, but in the rules, NT6 also has NT64 \u2192 NT15 NT22.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the provided grammar, most rules have two Nts on the right except for some that produce a single terminal? Or maybe I need to look for rules that have a terminal as the RHS.\n\nWait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a where a is a single terminal. But looking at the rules, all the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, meaning no terminals on the right side. So perhaps this grammar is not in CNF as a straight Chomsky Normal Form, but maybe with some variations.\n\nWait, looking at the rules again, some Nts produce other Nts, but none seem to produce a single terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 t6, which suggests that NT2 is a production that results in the terminal t6. So in that case, NT2 \u2192 t6 is a terminal production.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 \u2192 t25.\n\nSo, let me list all the NTs that have terminal productions:\n\nLooking back through the rules:\n\nLooking for any production where the RHS is a single terminal:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT22 \u2192 t15\n- NT22 \u2192 t9\n- NT26 \u2192 t14\n- NT36 \u2192 t41\n- NT40 \u2192 t34\n- NT41 \u2192 t4\n- NT5 \u2192 t35\n- NT8 \u2192 t2\n- NT14 \u2192 t37\n- NT39 \u2192 t22\n- NT40 \u2192 t8\n- NT42 \u2192 t24\n- NT54 is not in the rules here, but looking through the list:\n\nWait, let's look carefully:\n\n- NT70 \u2192 t70? No, NT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28.\n- Wait, no, in the rules provided, each production is two Nts. Wait, looking through all the rules, none of them directly have a terminal as the RHS, except perhaps I missed some.\n\nWait, wait, looking again, for example:\n\nLooking at this rule: NT22 \u2192 t15 and NT22 \u2192 t9.\n\nSimilarly, NT26 \u2192 t14.\n\nSo, yes, some NTs can produce terminals.\n\nSo, the initial step is that S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then, each of these Nts (NT9 and NT5) must generate specific sequences that together form the given string.\n\nLet's start with NT9.\n\nNT9's production is NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23.\n\nSo, after NT9, we'll have NT72 and NT23. Let's see what these produce.\n\nNT72 \u2192 NT24 NT23 (from the rules: NT24 \u2192 t6, NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22).\n\nWait, from the rules: NT72 \u2192 NT24 NT23.\n\nWait, no, looking at the rules, the production for NT24 is NT24 \u2192 t6, but wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, the provided rules: Let me see NT24 is defined as NT24 \u2192 t6. So yes, NT24 is a terminal that produces t6.\n\nSo, for NT72 \u2192 NT24 NT23. So first, NT72 produces NT24 and NT23.\n\nNT24 \u2192 t6, so that's the first t6.\n\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22.\n\nSo now, after NT9, we have t6, followed by NT93 and NT22.\n\nNow, NT93 has multiple productions. Let's see: NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 (from rule 93 \u2192 NT16 NT5), and also \u2192 NT79 NT42, \u2192 NT6 NT14, \u2192 NT86 NT27, \u2192 NT43 NT7, \u2192 NT83 NT96.\n\nLet me see which of these can lead to the string starting as t35.\n\nWait, the next symbol after t6 is t35. So, we have t6, t35, etc.\n\nBut wait, after NT72 \u2192 NT24 NT23, we get t6, and then NT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22.\n\nSo, after t6, the string continues as t35, t6, t24, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure this better.\n\nLet me represent the string as a list of symbols and try to match them step by step.\n\nThe given string is:\n\nt35, t6, t24, t10, t24, t34, t24, t6, t24, t10, t41, t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-866","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of rules. Some non-terminals produce two other non-terminals, and others produce a terminal. My task is to see if the string can be derived starting from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, I notice that the string starts with 't35'. Let me find which non-terminal produces 't35'. Scanning through the rules, I see that NT95 -> 't35' is a production. So, from NT95, we can derive 't35'. Then, what does NT95 produce? The only production for NT95 is NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11 (since NT95 -> NT10 NT11). Wait, no, looking again, the grammar is a bit longer. Let me check the exact production.\n\nWait, looking at the provided grammar, I see NT95 -> NT10 NT11 and NT10 -> NT26 NT63. Hmm, that's not 't35', no. Wait, maybe I misread.

So for example, NT55 \u2192 't20' and so on. So let's see, the string starts with 't35 t36 t35 t6 t35 t24 t34 t24 t26 t41 t35 t20 t6 t24 t24 t8 t24 t5 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t24 t36 t31 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t23 t34 t35'.\n\nLooking at the first token, 't35', which can come from NT95 \u2192 't35'. So the first symbol in the string is from NT95.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT95 NT52. Wait, no, the first production is S \u2192 NT95 NT52. So S expands to NT95 and NT52. So the string must be built from these two non-terminals.\n\nWait, but wait the string starts with 't35', which is from NT95, so that part makes sense. Then the next token is 't36'. Let's see, what does NT52 produce?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT52 has the following productions:\n\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nNT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88\nNT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\nNT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nNT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\n...\n\nWait, so NT52 can produce NT69 and NT88. Looking at 't36', which non-terminal produces it. From the list, NT69 \u2192 't36'. So that's possible.\n\nSo, the first part could be NT52 \u2192 NT69 (which gives 't36') and NT88. Wait, but 't36' is the second token, so NT52's expansion must include t36 somehow.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a parse tree, starting from S and seeing if the string can be matched.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT95 NT52. So the first part is NT95 and the second part is NT52.\n\nNT95 produces 't35', which is the first token in the string. So that part checks out.\n\nNow, NT52 needs to produce the rest, which starts with 't36 t35 t6 ...'. Let me see the production options for NT52. One of them is NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88. N69 produces 't36' (from NT69 \u2192 't36'), so that would yield 't36' as the first symbol of NT52's expansion. But wait, in NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88, so NT69 is a non-terminal and NT88 is another.\n\nSo, NT69 \u2192 't36', and NT88 can produce 't5' (NT88 \u2192 't5'), which is the fourth token of the string. Hmm, but the string starts with 't36 t35', so maybe it's more complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the initial expansion is not straightforward. Perhaps I should consider that both NT95 and NT52 produce multiple non-terminals that eventually produce the given 't's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a context-free grammar with symbols and see how the string is generated.\n\nWait, another approach: each non-terminal corresponds to a production that can generate a string, and the string given is a sequence of terminals. We need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking for the start symbol S \u2192 NT95 NT52.\n\nSo the string must start with NT95's expansion and NT52's expansion concatenated.\n\nNt95 \u2192 't35', so the first token is 't35', which matches. Now, the rest starts with t36, t35, etc.\n\nNT52's expansion must produce the rest after NT95's 't35'. So let's see how NT52 can produce t36 t35...\n\nWait, perhaps it would help to break down the possible expansions step by step.\n\nLet me think recursively. Each non-terminal can be replaced by its production rules, and we can see if the string can be built.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's easiest to try and parse the string step by step, seeing if each terminal can be matched by the productions.\n\nLet me start from the beginning:\n\n1. 't35': comes from NT95\u2019s NT95 \u2192 't35'. So, after using this production, the entire string is the expansion of the other side, which is NT52.\n\nSo, the string after the first token is: t36 t35 t6 t35 t24 t34 t24 t26 t41 t35 t20 t6 t24 t24 t8 t24 t5 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t24 t36 t31 t35 t37 t35 t20 t26 t41 t10 t26 t10 t26 t24 t31 t26 t37 t23 t34 t35.\n\nSo now, we have to check if NT52 can generate this sequence.\n\nLooking at NT52's productions: NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88, NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96, NT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81, NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96. Wait, perhaps multiple options, but let's see which one makes sense.\n\nLooking at the first two terminals now: 't36' and 't35'. Wait, according to the current perspective, NT52 needs to produce t36 followed by t35, etc. So, I need to find a production for NT52 that can produce a string starting with 't36's and 't35's.\n\nLooking at NT52's first symbol possibilities: the first symbol is 't36' which would come from NT69, because NT69 \u2192 't36'. So, suppose NT52 uses the production NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88. Then, NT69 produces 't36', and NT88 continues the sequence.\n\nNow, the sequence after"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-883","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't35 t36 t35...' and so on. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, all the non-terminals (like S, NT52, NT84, etc.) eventually expand into terminals, which are these 't' followed by numbers. So each rule ends with a terminal symbol, or branches into two non-terminals.\n\nThe string provided is a series of 't' followed by numbers, such as 't35', 't36', etc. My task is to see if this string can be produced by the grammar. \n\nI think the best approach is to try to parse the string backward using the grammar. Since each production in CNF either produces a single terminal or two non-terminals, the string can be reconstructed from the top-down or bottom-up. Parsing bottom-up might be a good idea because the string is already a sequence of terminals, so starting from the end and trying to find if the non-terminals can connect.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production can only have two symbols on the right side. This suggests that the string's length and the structure can help determine if it's possible.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the string. Each terminal in the string is a 't' followed by a number. Looking at the grammar rules, each non-terminal expands into a single terminal or into two other non-terminals. For example, the rule S \u2192 NT9 NT5 means that S expands into two non-terminals, NT9 and NT5. Each of these can then expand further.\n\nI should note the number of symbols in the string. The string has 40 tokens, each separated by a space. Since each production in CNF results in two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal), we can model this as building a parse tree where each internal node has two children.\n\nWait, but the string is 40 tokens. Let's think about how that relates to the parse tree. In a binary tree (which is what CNF implies, as each rule produces two symbols), the number of leaves is equal to the number of terminals. So, in this case, the number of leaves would correspond to the tokens in the string. But 40 is an even number, and in a binary tree, the number of leaves is equal to the number of internal nodes plus one. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each production step can only reduce the number of non-terminals by one. So starting from the initial symbol S, each step combines two non-terminals into one until we get to the start symbol. The number of symbols at the end must be equal to the number of leaves in the derivation tree. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to count the number of non-terminals in the string. Let me parse the string into its tokens. Each token is of the form 't' followed by a number, like 't35', 't36', etc. Let me see how many tokens there are. \n\nLooking at the string: t35, t36, t35, t6, t35, t36, t35, t8, t37, t12, t34, t36, t20, t8, t35, t25, t23, t9, t35, t37, t34, t24, t6, t37, t40, t15, t26, t10, t4, t5, t14, t15, t2, t25, t41, t31, t26, t22, t26, t10, t37, t36, t26, t37, t23, t34, t22.\n\nThat's 40 tokens. Now, in a CNF grammar, each production either introduces one terminal or two non-terminals. So, during derivation, the start symbol S will eventually expand into a sequence of terminals based on the productions. The number of terminals in the string must match the number of leaves in the parse tree.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think about the possible expansion. Each non-terminal can generate a terminal or two non-terminals. So, any string in the language must have a structure consistent with these productions.\n\nLet me look at the last symbols of the string. The last token is 't22'. Looking at the grammar, 't22' can be generated by certain NT rules. Alternatively, perhaps NT22 \u2192 t22 is a rule. Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nWait, in the grammar definitions, I see lines like:\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSo NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. So in the string, if the last token is 't22', that would mean that in the parse tree, the last leaf is generated by one of these rules. But wait, that's not possible because 't22' is a terminal, and a production that produces a terminal can't expand further. So, in the string, 't22' must be a direct result of such a production. However, in a CNF grammar, every production must have exactly two symbols on the right-hand side. That includes when a non-terminal expands into a terminal symbol. Wait, no: in CNF, the productions must be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So a non-terminal can produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. In the given grammar, some rules produce a single terminal. For example, lines like:\n\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\n\nSo NT22 can produce 't15', 't9', or 't34'. So in the bottom-up parsing, if the string ends with 't22', that means that in the parse tree, there must be a node labeled NT22 that produces that 't22' as a terminal, so the string must end with that terminal. So, in the given string, the last token is 't22', which is possible if the derivation process ends with NT22 \u2192 t22.\n\nBut wait, that would imply that in the parse tree, the last non-terminal is NT22, which directly produces 't22'. So, when we start from the root S, we can build up the string by expanding non-terminals into their expansions until we reach all 't' tokens.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each token in the string is a result of a production. Since the grammar starts with S, and each step either introduces two non-terminals or a terminal, the number of non-terminals in the parse tree and the terminals must follow certain rules.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to perform a backward pass, starting from the string and trying to merge symbols according to the grammar rules. Since the string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, each token is a terminal that must come from a production rule that ends with that terminal.\n\nStarting from the end, each token 'tX' must come from a non-terminal NTX in the grammar, where X is the number. So for 't22' at the end, the last non-terminal before that must be NT22.\n\nBut wait, if the last symbol is generated by NT22, then in the parse tree, the last step would be NT22 \u2192 't22', and the rest of the string must come from the expansion of other non-terminals before that.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar may have rules that combine non-terminals into other non-terminals, perhaps the entire string is built by a series of steps combining and splitting non-terminals until the final string is obtained.\n\nWait, perhaps a more systematic way is to look for the entire string as a sequence of tokens that can be derived by the grammar. Let's think about possible pairs and tripletts.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to see if the string can be formed by the concatenation of the terminal symbols that the grammar can produce. Each non-terminal can produce a specific terminal, so the grammar defines a set of terminal strings.\n\nIn the grammar, each non-terminal's production can be seen as a function that maps to a specific terminal or another non-terminal. So, every non-terminal has exactly one production that produces a terminal, and other productions split into two non-terminals.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, which suggests that S expands into NT9 and NT5. Each of these, in turn, will expand according to their own productions.\n\nIf each NT produces a specific terminal, then the sequence of tokens must correspond to the sequence of terminals generated by the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the end of the string: 't22' comes from"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-887","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've been given a problem where I need to determine if a certain string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me break this down and think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit that structure because all the rules produce two non-terminals on the right side except for the rules where a terminal is directly produced, like NT70 -> 't24'. But wait, 't24' is a terminal, right? So in CNF, a production can also be a single terminal on the right. That makes sense.\n\nThe grammar has a set of non-terminals and terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT9 and NT5. Each of these non-terminals then goes on to produce other non-terminals until eventually they reach terminals.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of terminals: `t35 t24 t10 t36 t8 t35 t37 t20 t20 t6 t37 t35 t36 t20 t8 t35 t24 t5 t22 t15 t12 t2 t32 t26 t15 t26 t24 t5 t23 t9 t23 t22 t24 t6 t12 t22 t4 t32 t26 t35 t25 t8 t9 t3 t35 t34 t35`.\n\nI need to parse this string against the grammar to see if it can be derived. Parsing in CNF can be done using a top-down approach, like the CYK algorithm, or a bottom-up approach, like recursive descent. Alternatively, I might look for reduction paths starting from the start symbol S and see if I can build the string step by step.\n\nBut since this string is quite long (let me count the tokens... it looks like there are 57 tokens), manually tracing each step would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for patterns or reductions that could help me break it down.\n\nAlternatively, I could represent the string as a list and try to match productions from the start, reducing the string each time a production is matched.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals and see how they connect to terminals.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo the first step is to produce NT9 and NT5. Then each of these can produce further non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLooking at NT9's productions:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14\n- NT93 seems to be a typo, probably NT9 instead.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\nNT93 has multiple productions, but also NT9 is listed elsewhere, like in NT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35, etc. I need to be careful with the non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first rule is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so that's key. So S generates NT9 and NT5. Let me see what NT9 can do. Looking at the rules, NT9 can produce NT72 NT23, and that's it. There's also a rule for NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14, but wait, where is NT9 defined? Looking back, maybe I misread.\n\nWait, no, let me check: the grammar has rules like NT9 being on the left. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see NT9 defined as a non-terminal anywhere else except as a left-hand side in the rule S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So maybe I need to check if NT9 is present elsewhere.\n\nWait, no, checking the given grammar, I see for example NT89 is a non-terminal because it's on the left in the rule NT89 \u2192 NT72 NT23, which is another rule. So NT9 isn't listed as a left-hand side of any other production except for S. That means NT9 is only present in S's production and nowhere else. So once S is expanded, the NT9 can't be split further. It must be expanded further into its own productions.\n\nWait, but looking back at the rules, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me re-examine the grammar. The given rules include:\n\n- S \u2192 NT9 NT5\n\nSo S can produce NT9 and NT5. Now, looking for NT9 in the rules, maybe I missed it. Let me scan the rules.\n\nWait, the rules start with S, then NT52, NT84, etc. I don't see NT9 being a left-hand side of any production except in the case of NT93, which is also present multiple times. Hmm, perhaps I overlooked it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the entire grammar again.

{"custom_id":"request-909","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokens, and each token seems to correspond to a production rule's right-hand side. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that every production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol S, which can produce a single terminal. Looking at the grammar, S starts as S -> NT9 NT5. So S is a combination of two non-terminals, which makes sense for CNF.\n\nNext, each non-terminal like NT9, NT5, etc., has productions that either break down into other non-terminals or eventually into terminals (t followed by a number). For example, NT52->NT89 NT35, and then NT89 and NT35 further break down until we get to terminals like t24, etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a long sequence of these 't' tokens. Each token is a terminal, so we need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Essentially, we can think of the string as a parse tree where each node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal.\n\nTo approach this, I can try to parse the string using the grammar, starting from S and decomposing it until I reach all terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step will replace a non-terminal with two others until we get to the terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the string. It's 60 tokens long, which suggests a moderately complex derivation. Since the grammar is CNF, the number of productions used would be logarithmic, but given the length, it's probably a deep derivation.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to look for patterns or rules that can help break the string into parts. For instance, looking at the first few tokens: t35 t6 t37 t10 t10 t24...\n\nI'll try to see if these correspond to a production starting from S or another non-terminal. Let me see which non-terminal starts with t35. Looking at the grammar, NT66->t3, NT4->t35, NT22->t15, etc. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the leftmost derivation. Starting with S, which is NT9 and NT5. Let's check the rules for NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking at NT9: The rules I see are NT93 -> NT16 NT5, but that's under NT93, not NT9. Let me check NT9's rules. I don't see NT9 in the list except as NT93. Wait, maybe I missed it. Oh, perhaps NT9 doesn't have any rules, meaning it's a terminal. Wait, but the production rules start with S, then each non-terminal is either a combination or leads to terminals.\n\nWait, looking back, I see that NT66 is a non-terminal, but not NT9. So perhaps I need to check the production for NT9. Wait, actually, looking through the list, I don't see a production for NT9 except in the case of NT93. So does that mean NT9 is a terminal? Or maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the grammar. Each line is a production of the form A -> BC. Most of these produce two non-terminals. But looking at some, like S->NT9 NT5. So S is a combination of NT9 and NT5, which suggests that NT9 and NT5 are non-terminals. But then, looking for NT9's production, I don't see it except in cases like NT93->NT16 NT5, which is a production for NT93.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. So perhaps NT9 is a terminal because there's no production for it, only NT93. So NT93 leads to t16 and t5. So NT9 is a terminal? Because in the rules, there's no further split for NT9, implying it's a terminal symbol.\n\nSimilarly, looking through the rules, some non-terminals are terminal others aren't. Wait, let's check each line:\n\n- NT93 has multiple rules, but not involving any terminals except in one production: NT95->NT10 NT11, which is not a terminal. Oh wait, actually, in the list, the terminals are all the 't' followed by numbers, like 't24', 't35', etc.\n\nSo, the non-terminals are all the NT... like NT66, NT4, etc., and the terminals are the 't' tokens.\n\nSo starting from S: S -> NT9 NT5. Since NT9 is a terminal? Or is NT9 a non-terminal with no production, meaning it's a terminal.\n\nWait, no, because NT9 is a non-terminal because it's used as part of S's production. But in the production rules provided, there's no rule for NT9, except maybe NT93 which is different. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar is in CNF, so each non-terminal on the right-hand side must have two non-terminals, except for the base case which produces terminals. So, looking through the rules, I can see that some non-terminals lead directly to terminals, like NT52->t24.\n\nWait, actually, looking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT52->t24\n- NT66->t3\n- NT9->t35\n\nWait, that can't be because the grammar is in CNF. NT9 can only be a non-terminal if it has productions leading to other non-terminals, not terminals. Hmm, perhaps I've misinterpreted the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are written with the left-hand side (LHS) being a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) being two non-terminals. So, for example:\n\nS-> NT9 NT5: So S is a non-terminal, producing NT9 and NT5, which are also non-terminals.\n\nLooking for the productions of NT9 and NT5.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT85->t21, etc., but for NT9:\n\nNT93->NT16 NT5: So that's NT93's production.\n\nBut where is NT9's production? It doesn't seem to be present, unless perhaps it's defined as a terminal. But in CNF, a non-terminal cannot directly produce a terminal unless it's a leaf node.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me go through the rules again.\n\nLooking for NT9:\n\n- Looking for any line starting with NT9.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT9 on the left-hand side except in NT93. So, NT9 seems to be a terminal, as it doesn't have a production that breaks it down. So NT9 is a terminal equal to 't35' because I see in the rules:\n\nLooking through the lines, I find NT95->t21, but that's part of another production.\n\nWait, let's check NT9's role. Since S->NT9 NT5, and if NT9 is a terminal, then NT5 must also be a terminal or a non-terminal. But looking for NT5, do we have a production for NT5?\n\nYes, looking through the rules, we have:\n\n- NT78->t24, etc.\n\nBut specifically, looking for NT5:\n\nNT10->t26, etc.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT5 is a non-terminal with a production, like NT25->t25.\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT25->t25. So NT25 is a production that leads to t25, meaning NT25 is a non-terminal.\n\nBut in S->NT9 NT5, if NT9 is a terminal, and NT5 is a non-terminal, then we need a production for NT5.\n\nLooking for NT5, I see:\n\nNo direct mention of NT5 in the LHS of the productions, except in NT52->NT66 NT24.\n\nWait, so perhaps NT5 has a production that breaks it down. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT52->NT66 NT24.\n\nWait, that's a production for NT52, not NT5. So maybe NT5 is a non-terminal that breaks down into NT51 and NT25, as per NT51->... Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.\n\nThis is getting complicated.

{"custom_id":"request-900","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is quite long, and the grammar has a bunch of production rules. I'm a bit rusty on how to approach this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, the grammar provided fits CNF because all the rules are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to check is: `t35 t36 t8 t37 t35 t37 t20 t8 t35 t24 t5 t35 t34 t12 t35 t37 t20 t6 t12 t2 t32 t26 t22 t26 t24 t36 t26 t35 t6 t37 t10 t36 t15 t6 t37 t8 t35 t24 t5 t35 t9 t23 t22 t26 t37 t8 t15 t35`.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, I can ignore the non-terminals during the parsing and focus on the terminals. My goal is to apply the grammar's rules to see if the string can be derived.\n\nI think a good way to start is by trying to derive the string step by step. The grammar has many rules, so I might need to figure out the productions that generate each part of the string. Alternatively, perhaps I can work backwards from the string, applying reverse productions where possible.\n\nLet me try to identify some key points. The string starts with `t35`, which appears several times throughout. Looking at the grammar rules, `NT93` and `NT84` both have `NT35` in them, and they produce `t35` in some cases. For example, `NT93 -> NT6 NT14`, which eventually becomes `t35` via `NT6 -> t35` and other rules. Similarly, `NT84 -> ... -> t35`.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, many non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, `NT6 -> t25`, `NT10 -> t26`, `NT15 -> t4`, etc. So, the string is built from these terminal symbols, which are all single letters like t35, t36, etc.\n\nI think I should try to parse the string from the beginning. Start with the first symbol, `t35`. Looking at the grammar, where can `t35` be found? Checking the rules, I see that `NT6 \u2192 t25`, which isn't helpful. Looking for `t35`, I see that `NT28 -> t15`, but that's not `t35`. Wait, actually, I don't see a production directly to `t35` except in some longer rules. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps `t35` is a terminal, so it must come from a production that ends with it, like a rule ending with `t35`. Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see entries like `NT26 -> t14`, no. `NT36 -> t41`, no. Wait, maybe it's on the right-hand side but not on the left. Let me scan through all the rules to see if any produce `t35`.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11: no\n- NT89 -> NT72 NT83: no\n- NT9 -> NT72 NT23: no\n- NT70 -> NT82 NT52: no\n- NT22 -> NT93 NT22: part of the input is t22\n- Wait, the string has t22 in it, but I'm focusing on t35. I need to find a production that results in t35.\n\nWait a minute, looking at the rules, I don't immediately see any rule that directly produces t35. That might be an issue. Unless t35 is derived from non-terminals that eventually produce t35.\n\nWait, let's check the production rules for NT35. Looking through the rules, I see NT35 is only in the left-hand side, but not directly as a production. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT36 -> NT27 NT43\n- NT27 -> 't24'\n- NT43 -> NT0 NT96\n- NT0 -> NT70 NT80\n- NT70 -> NT78 NT28\n- And so on. Hmm, maybe it's not directly producing t35. Alternatively, perhaps there's a sequence that leads to t35.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me see: In the grammar, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So to get a terminal symbol, there must be a production that directly outputs it. So for example, NT6 \u2192 t25, NT83 \u2192 t8, etc.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t35. Unless it's via a chain of productions that eventually reach t35.\n\nWait, but looking again, maybe I'm missing a production for NT35. Let me scan through the rules:\n\nThe rules provided don't seem to include NT35 on the left-hand side, only NT93, NT84, etc. So, I'm not seeing any rule where a non-terminal A directly produces t35, i.e., A \u2192 t35.\n\nThis might be a problem. Because if no rule directly produces t35, then we can't derive t35 as a terminal. Therefore, the string contains t35, but if there's no production for t35, the string can't be generated. So, that would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Perhaps I should look more carefully through all the rules.\n\nLet me list out all the rules and see if any of them produce t35:\n\n- NT93 -> NT6 NT14\n- NT84 -> NT28 NT8\n- NT93 -> NT16 NT5\n- NT69 -> NT88 NT26\n- NT93 -> NT79 NT42\n- NT78 -> NT35 NT95\n- NT15 -> NT27 NT60\n- NT36 -> NT35 NT56\n- NT95 -> NT10 NT11\n- NT0 -> NT70 NT80\n- NT93 -> NT6 NT14 (again)\n- NT52 -> NT60 NT81, etc.\n\nWait, so looking at NT93, one of its productions is `NT93 -> NT35 NT95`. So if I have NT93, I can split it into NT35 and NT95. Then, each of those can be split further.\n\nLooking at NT35, it's in the left-hand side, but in the rules, the right-hand sides are combinations of two non-terminals or a terminal. So the only rule that ends up with a terminal is in the right-hand side, not on the left.\n\nWait, I see that NT35 is a left-hand side, but not as a production. Let me make sure: The rules are about what a non-terminal can expand into. So, for example, the production NT35 -> t35 would be a direct terminal. But I don't see that. The rules for NT35 don't exist as a production, which suggests that t35 is formed by combining other non-terminals.\n\nLooking more closely, in the grammar provided, the rule NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5 produces NT16 and NT5. Then, if NT16 has a production that leads to NT35, or if NT5 has a production that leads to NT35, perhaps indirectly.\n\nBut wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any direct way a non-terminal directly produces t35. The closest is the rule NT93 \u2192 NT35 NT95. So if we have NT93, we can produce NT35 and NT95. Then, if NT35 can produce t35, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, looking again, I think I made a mistake. The rule NT35 -> ... doesn't exist. So perhaps NT93 splits into NT35 and NT95, and both of those must produce terminals. But if there's no production for NT35 that ends in t35, then that part can't be used.\n\nWait, let me check another angle. Since the string has 't35' starting it, I need a production that leads to t35. So perhaps the root symbol S must produce something that leads to t35.

{"custom_id":"request-924","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether this string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should make parsing easier, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.\n\nThe string to check is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like `t35 t4 t4 t23 ...`. I think that each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, and the numbers (like 23) must be the left-hand sides of the productions. So first, I should parse the string into tokens, separating the 't' parts and numbers. Wait, looking at the grammar, the terminals are all the tokens that end with 't' followed by a number, like 't35', 't4', etc.\n\nSo each 't' part is a terminal symbol. The grammar's productions start with S, which is the start symbol. Each production on the left has two non-terminals on the right, except the ones ending with a terminal like `NT10 -> t26`.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals, so I need to see if the sequence can be formed by the grammar. Since this is a CFG, I can try the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe a recursive descent approach could work.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to look for the structure of the string. Let's see, the string starts with 't35', and the grammar has a production `NT35 -> NT42 NT87`, which then branches into more non-terminals and terminals. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I can try to split the string into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the initial productions are like S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the entire string should be reducible to S. Let's see, the string is a long chain of terminals, so each production must decompose into that.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a derivation path. The string is 40 tokens long, which is manageable. Let me split it into pairs as per the grammar, which seems to use two symbols at a time. Wait, no, in Chomsky Normal Form, each production has two non-terminals, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so perhaps the derivation alternates between non-terminals and terminals.\n\nI'm a bit stuck. Maybe I can break the string into segments that match the productions. Let's list the string again:\n\nt35 t4 t4 t23 t22 t5 t25 t41 t40 t10 t26 t35 t24 t5 t22 t9 t6 t37 t20 t6 t37 t35 t24 t37 t20 t40 t15 t26 t24 t24 t26 t41 t35 t40 t15 t26 t15 t26 t24 t10 t36 t20 t26 t41 t15 t31 t23 t15 t35.\n\nWait, but each production on the left has two symbols. So, perhaps the string is built by the RHS of the productions. For each production A \u2192 BC, the string would have B followed by C. So, the entire string should consist of a sequence of such B and C, starting from S.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So the first two symbols should be derived from NT9 and NT5. But wait, the string starts with t35, which is a terminal, not a non-terminal. So perhaps the first NT9 is a non-terminal that expands into a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, NT9 can be NT72 or NT23, and also NT96. Then NT72 goes where? Let me check: NT72 is either 't32' or NT35. NT35 is NT42 NT87, which are non-terminals, and they can further split.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should look for the sequence in the grammar. Let's take the string and see if it can be split into parts that match the productions.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t35 t4. Looking at the grammar, there's a NT4 \u2192 t35. So if NT4 is part of the production, then the first few symbols might start with 't35', which would be from NT4.\n\nBut wait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so the first two symbols should come from NT9 and NT5. But NT9 can produce t72 or 't4' (looking at NT9: NT72 | t23 | t35? Wait, in the grammar provided, looking for NT9: does it produce something with a terminal? Let's check.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see:\n\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n\nWait, looking for NT9: There's NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 and NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14. Hmm, but I don't see NT9 \u2192 't35' directly. Wait, looking again, I see NT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4, but not NT9.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me scan the grammar again. Oh, I see NT95 has some terms, but no, the only NT9 productions I see are NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23 and NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT14. So no, NT9 doesn't produce a terminal directly. Hmm, that complicates things because the string starts with 't35', which would have to be produced by a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT9 NT5, so the first two symbols would come from NT9 and NT5. But NT9 can't directly produce a terminal, so it must expand into some other non-terminals that do produce terminals. Similarly, NT5 must expand as well.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: Looking at the grammar, I see NT52 and NT69, but not NT5. Maybe I missed it. Wait, let me scan through the grammar again. I don't see NT5 as a non-terminal on the left-hand side of any production except when it's part of a larger production, like NT52 \u2192 NT69 NT88 or NT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

{"custom_id":"request-920","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The string I\u2019m given is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which I assume are the terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, let me recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) looks like. CNF has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. This structure helps in parsing and, in this case, in determining the derivation of the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The initial production for S is S \u2192 NT9 NT5. So any derivation starts with two non-terminals: NT9 and NT5. Each step involves replacing a non-terminal with two other non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nThe string provided is quite long, with 48 tokens. Let\u2019s break it down into manageable parts. The string is composed of symbols like t35, t36, etc. Each 't' seems to be a terminal that corresponds to specific non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach here is to work backwards. Starting from the string and seeing if it can be parsed using the given productions. Each step involves combining two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) to match a production.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is small and maybe has a pattern, perhaps the string is a result of a specific derivation. Let me see if the overall length of the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nEach production in CNF either introduces one terminal or splits a non-terminal into two. So the length of the string (number of terminals) is related to the number of productions used. Starting from S, each step can increase the number of symbols.\n\nWait, the grammar might have a specific structure. Let me look through the productions to see if there's a pattern. For example, NT66 seems to always produce 't3', but I'm not sure. Also, some non-terminals map directly to 't' symbols, like NT6 \u2192 t25, NT22 \u2192 t15 or t34, etc.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken into parts that correspond to the grammar. Let me see the string:\n\nt35 t36 t34 t24 t6 t37 t6 t35 t37 t20 t40 t15 t26 t24 t36 t26 t24 t10 t36 t6 t35 t36 t37 t35 t40 t15 t26 t24 t24 t6 t37 t8 t24 t5 t12 t34 t20 t14 t37 t41 t32 t26 t10 t36 t36 t4 t23 t9 t22\n\nI need to see if this can be broken into a sequence of productions. Let me try to parse it.\n\nStart from the beginning: t35 t36... Hmm. t35 might correspond to a specific non-terminal. Let me look at the productions for NT78 \u2192 t40 and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I should first see what each 't' corresponds to in the grammar. For example, NT66 produces t3, but in the string, I don't see t3. Maybe looking for direct productions.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t25\n- NT15 \u2192 t4\n- NT22 \u2192 t15 or t34\n- NT26 \u2192 t14 or t23\n- NT27 \u2192 t24\n- NT35 \u2192 t35 (if NT35 \u2192 t35)\nWait, wait. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nNT35 has several productions, including NT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87, etc., but nowhere in the productions does NT35 directly produce t35. Hmm. Maybe I need to see other non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-terminals directly produce t symbols. Let's list them:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t25\nNT15 \u2192 t4\nNT22 \u2192 t15 or t34\nNT26 \u2192 t14 or t23\nNT27 \u2192 t24\nNT36 \u2192 t41\nNT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96, etc., and in the string, I don't see NT4. But perhaps NT36 can produce t41, which is present in the string. Also, NT37 \u2192 t34 (since in the last productions, NT37 doesn't directly produce a t, but maybe NT37 can derive into a t after more steps. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the productions, I don't see any NT37 directly producing a t. Instead, NT37 has productions like NT37 \u2192 NT25 NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's see if the string can be split into parts that match the non-terminals' productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the counts of each symbol. Because each production either contributes one terminal or splits into two non-terminals, the number of terminals can be determined based on the number of splits. Let me think: Each production of a non-terminal either adds one terminal or continues with two other non-terminals. So, starting from S, we have two non-terminals. Each non-terminal can expand into two, so the maximum number of non-terminals at each step doubles.\n\nWait, perhaps this is a case where the number of terminals is determined by the number of initial symbols. For example, starting with two non-terminals, each can produce two, so after some steps, the number of non-terminals can be 2^k, and the number of terminals would be 2^k -1, because of the way the productions work.\n\nWait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think. Suppose starting with S \u2192 NT9 NT5. Then each of these NT9 and NT5 can either produce terminals (if they have a production that ends in a terminal) or split into two non-terminals. The total number of symbols in the string is the number of terminals, but each split adds more non-terminals, but when they produce terminals, that's the end.\n\nSo the total number of terminals must be equal to the number of production steps that result in terminals, and each such production adds one terminal. But if a non-terminal splits into two, each split adds a new non-terminal, increasing the count.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each start symbol S can derive a string of terminals by a certain number of steps. Each step can contribute 0 or 1 terminal, depending on whether the non-terminal splits into two non-terminals or produces a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, the grammar's structure might lead to specific lengths of the generated strings. For example, if every production for a non-terminal leads to an even number of symbols, the string length would be even. But in the given string, the length is 48, which is even. But that\u2019s a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe I can model this as a derivation tree. Starting with S, each step branches into two, and each of those can branch again, etc. The number of leaves (terminals) can vary based on how the non-terminals are expanded. Let me see: Each time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, the count increases by one (since each split adds an additional non-terminal). For example, starting with 1 symbol (S), after one split: 2. After each split, each non-terminal can split, but the total count of symbols increases by 1 each time a split happens.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: At each step, each non-terminal can split into two non-terminals, so the count of non-terminals could increase by 1 for each split. Alternatively, if a non-terminal produces a terminal, the total count of symbols decreases by 1 (since replacing one non-terminal with one terminal).\n\nSo the length of the string (number of terminals) can vary, but it must satisfy certain constraints based on the grammar's productions. However, this might be too involved without knowing exactly which productions are taken.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be parsed by the grammar. Each step in the parsing would involve matching a part of the string to a production and then recursively checking the resulting string.\n\nLet me attempt a top-down approach, starting with the entire string and trying to match it to the top-level production, which is S \u2192 NT9 NT5.\n\nSo, the entire string should match NT9 followed by NT5. Let's split the string into two parts: the first part should match NT9, and the second part should match NT5.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nThe first symbol is t35. Let me check what NT9 can produce. Looking at the productions:\n\nNT9 has several productions, including:\n- NT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\n- NT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\n- NT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\n- NT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

That's quite a long string. First, I need to understand the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is either A->BC or A->a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many of them on the left side (NT) are splitting into two non-terminals, and some directly into terminals like 't24', 't25', etc. Since the string consists entirely of 't' prefixes, the terminals, I need to check if each 't' can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking at the production rules for each non-terminal that leads to a 't' terminal. For example, NT89 -> NT72 NT83, but I don't see any production for NT83 that leads directly to a terminal. Wait, looking at the rules, some like NT42 -> 't24' directly. So if a non-terminal can produce a 't' terminal, that's a starting point.\n\nI should probably work backwards. Let's start from the first symbol in the string, 't35'. So what non-terminals produce 't35'? Looking at the rules, NT84 -> 't5', but that's not helpful. Wait, no. Wait, looking for NT that produce 't35' as a terminal.

Let's look again. No, actually, in the rules, many of the non-terminals have productions that result in terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT13 -> 't4'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT26 -> 't14', 't22'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT85 -> 't4'\n- NT28 -> 't10', 't26'\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list all the rules that produce a terminal (not NT):\n\n- NT2 -> 't6'\n- NT4 -> 't35'\n- NT6 -> 't25'\n- NT15 -> 't4'\n- NT22 -> 't15', 't9', 't34'\n- NT26 -> 't14', 't22'\n- NT42 -> 't24'\n- NT55 -> 't20'\n- NT80 -> 't26'\n- NT81 -> 't4', 't4'\n- NT82 -> 't4', 't63' (but 't63' isn't a terminal, so that's incorrect)\n- Wait, no, the first line after NT82 is NT82 -> NT49 NT96, which then leads to NT68, which I'm not sure. Maybe I should focus on the ones that directly produce 't's.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't35'. So which non-terminal produces 't35'? Looking at the rules, NT4 -> 't35'. So one path is S -> NT52 NT95, then NT52 can split into NT69 and NT81, etc. But this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to see if each 't' in the string can be the result of a production.\n\nAlternative approach: For each symbol in the string, determine if there's a production for a non-terminal that can derive it. For instance:\n\n- Start with the first token, 't35'. Does any non-terminal produce 't35'? Yes, NT4 -> 't35'.\n- Next token: 't6'. Does any NT produce 't6'? Looking through the rules, NT13 -> 't4', NT22 -> 't34', etc. Wait, do any produce 't6'? I don't see a direct production. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't6' \u2192 Oh yes, so 't6' is directly produced by NT2.\n- Next is 't24'. Looking for NT that produce 't24'. Yes, NT42 -> 't24'.\n- Then 't10'. Looking for NT that produce 't10'. Let's check the rules. NT28 -> 't10', so yes.\n- Next is 't36'. Looking for NT that produce 't36'. NT36 is a non-terminal, and its productions: NT36 -> NT27 NT43 or NT35 NT56, but none produce 't's directly except through further splitting. So I might need to see if NT36 can lead to 't36' eventually. Looking through its productions, NT36 leads to other NTs, but none directly to 't36'. Hmm, maybe I'm missing it. Wait, no, looking again: NT36's rules all lead to other non-terminals, so to get 't36', perhaps it's through some production chain. Wait, but looking at the rules, maybe I've overlooked something. Maybe there's a production for NT35 or NT43 that leads to a 't' with 't36'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be generated by the grammar. Since the string is a sequence of 't's, all the non-terminals in the productions should eventually reach a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me think about each token:\n\n1. t35: NT4 -> 't35' \u2192 okay.\n2. t6: NT2 -> 't6' \u2192 okay.\n3. t24: NT42 -> 't24' \u2192 okay.\n4. t10: NT28 -> 't10' \u2192 okay.\n5. t36: Need a production for NT36 that leads to 't36'. Looking at the rules for NT36: NT36-> NT27 NT43, and NT43-> various options, but none directly produce 't36'. Wait, let me check if any other NTs produce 't36'. Looking through the terminal rules, do any non-terminals produce 't36' directly? Hmm, no. So perhaps I need to see if 't36' can be derived in another way. Maybe via NT27 or NT43?\n\nWait, looking at the right-hand sides, NT27 is 't27'? Let me check: NT70 -> 't78' and 't82'; NT70 also -> 't82'. Wait, no, sorry, the rules have NT70 -> 't78' and 't82'? Or is that something else?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT27: NT27 -> 't27' \u2192 Yes, because line says NT27 -> 't27'. So if a non-terminal can produce 't27', perhaps 't36' can come from a chain. Alternatively, maybe 't36' is produced by a different NT. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this systemically.\n\nPerhaps I should construct a parse tree for the string or see if each 't' can be resolved to an NT that can derive it. For 't36', I need to find a path starting from S to produce this. Let's try.\n\nLooking at the initial production: S-> NT52 NT95.\n\nNT52 -> NT69 NT81.\n\nNT69 -> NT85 NT52.\n\nWait, this seems like a loop. NT69 -> NT85 and NT52. NT52 -> NT69 and NT81.\n\nThis might go on indefinitely, but perhaps in the parse tree, it will terminate when a rule produces a terminal or another non-terminal that eventually leads to a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach.

{"custom_id":"request-948","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a series of 't' followed by numbers, which probably correspond to terminals in the grammar. My goal is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given production rules.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the grammar structure. The grammar is in CNF, which means every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S. I'll list out the productions to get a clearer picture.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a lot of productions for non-terminals with two non-terminals on the right. For example, S \u2192 NT9 NT5, and many others follow this pattern. Some have terminals on the right, like NT5 \u2192 't25', which might mean these NT symbols directly produce terminal strings.\n\nNow, the input string is: `t35 t37 t20 t6 t24 t12 t34 t22 t26 t24 t10 t37 t8 t37 t4 t15 t22 t4 t10 t36 t20 t34 t25 t24 t10 t37 t40 t15 t4 t41 t15 t24 t6 t12 t35 t35 t26 t35 t6 t37 t10 t36 t34 t3 t34 t25 t3 t23 t9 t35`.\n\nBreaking this down, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol. My task is to see if this sequence can be generated starting from S.\n\nI think the approach here is to work backwards from the given string, trying to match the production rules in reverse. This process is similar to parsing the string using the grammar rules to see if we can break it down into non-terminals that eventually lead back to S.\n\nLooking at the string, let's denote each part as tokens. The length is 63 tokens, which is quite long. So, manually parsing this might not be feasible, but I can look for patterns or possible derivations.\n\nStarting from the beginning, the first token is t35. Looking through the grammar, t35 appears on the right side of several productions. For example:\n\nNT73 \u2192 t34\nNT87 \u2192 t36\nNT87 \u2192 t31\nBut also, t35 is on the right side of NT28's production: NT28 \u2192 t10, which isn't helpful.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, t35 is directly produced by NT6:\nNT6 \u2192 t25 (no, wait no), NT00 I think. Wait, looking at the grammar, perhaps I should check for t35 as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides, I see NT55 \u2192 t43, but maybe:\n\nWait, let me compile a list of all terminals and their productions:\n\n- NT73 \u2192 't34' [t34 is also NT66]\n- NT66 \u2192 t3\n- NT22 \u2192 t23\n- NT49 \u2192 t8\n- NT39 \u2192 t22\n- NT14 \u2192 t23\n- NT88 \u2192 t5\n- NT51 \u2192 t20\n- NT5 \u2192 t35\n- NT10 \u2192 t26\n- NT2 \u2192 t6\n- NT66 \u2192 t4\n- NT22 \u2192 t34\n- NT4 \u2192 t35\n- NT84 \u2192 t5\n- NT85 \u2192 t4\n- NT28 \u2192 t10\n- NT60 \u2192 t12\n- NT36 \u2192 t41\n- NT64 \u2192 t23\n- etc.\n\nWait, I think a more systematic approach is needed.\n\nFirst, list all production rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nS \u2192 NT9 NT5\nNT52 \u2192 NT89 NT35\nNT84 \u2192 NT28 NT8\nNT93 \u2192 NT16 NT5\nNT69 \u2192 NT88 NT26\nNT93 \u2192 NT79 NT42\nNT78 \u2192 NT51 NT95\nNT15 \u2192 NT27 NT60\nNT36 \u2192 NT35 NT56\nNT95 \u2192 NT10 NT11\nNT0 \u2192 NT70 NT80\nNT93 \u2192 NT6 NT14\nNT52 \u2192 NT60 NT81\nNT52 \u2192 NT64 NT96\nNT35 \u2192 NT42 NT87\nNT42 \u2192 NT12 NT56\nNT23 \u2192 NT93 NT22\nNT86 \u2192 NT83 NT27\nNT79 \u2192 NT2 NT16\nNT43 \u2192 NT86 NT27\nNT83 \u2192 NT56 NT30\nNT82 \u2192 NT49 NT9\nNT36 \u2192 NT15 NT69\nNT70 \u2192 NT78 NT28\nNT10 \u2192 NT84 NT25\nNT88 \u2192 NT21 NT13\nNT4 \u2192 NT83 NT96\nNT10 \u2192 NT26 NT16\nNT56 \u2192 NT36 NT95\nNT36 \u2192 NT27 NT43\nNT30 \u2192 NT55 NT0\nNT43 \u2192 NT0 NT9\nNT69 \u2192 NT85 NT52\nNT89 \u2192 NT72 NT83\nNT9 \u2192 NT72 NT23\nNT70 \u2192 NT82 NT52\nNT21 \u2192 NT42 NT70\nNT82 \u2192 NT49 NT16\nNT6 \u2192 NT83 NT16\nNT81 \u2192 NT8 NT63\nNT8 \u2192 NT73 NT78\nNT13 \u2192 NT36 NT66\nNT95 \u2192 NT79 NT89\nNT85 \u2192 NT21 NT4\nNT81 \u2192 NT4 NT4\nNT16 \u2192 NT27 NT88\nNT26 \u2192 NT73 NT25\nNT8 \u2192 NT39 NT13\nNT55 \u2192 NT43 NT79\nNT64 \u2192 NT15 NT22\nNT27 \u2192 't24'\nNT22 \u2192 't15'\nNT22 \u2192 't9'\nNT55 \u2192 't20'\nNT80 \u2192 't26'\nNT56 \u2192 't36'\nNT10 \u2192 't26'\nNT72 \u2192 't35'\nNT78 \u2192 't40'\nNT6 \u2192 't25'\nNT15 \u2192 't4'\nNT2 \u2192 't6'\nNT66 \u2192 't3'\nNT22 \u2192 't34'\nNT4 \u2192 't35'\nNT84 \u2192 't5'\nNT85 \u2192 't4'\nNT28 \u2192 't10'\nNT66 \u2192 't4'\nNT60 \u2192 't12'\nNT36 \u2192 't41'\nNT56 \u2192 't37'\nNT82 \u2192 't6'\nNT51 \u2192 't20'\nNT5 \u2192 't35'\nNT26 \u2192 't14'\nNT64 \u2192 't23'\nNT49 \u2192 't8'\nNT39 \u2192 't22'\nNT73 \u2192 't34'\nNT87 \u2192 't36'\nNT14 \u2192 't23'\nNT88 \u2192 't5'\nNT16 \u2192 't37'\nNT12 \u2192 't10'\nNT87 \u2192 't31'\nNT28 \u2192 't10'\nNT39 \u2192 't8'\nNT96 \u2192 't22'\nNT11 \u2192 't41'\nNT5 \u2192 't22'\nNT55 \u2192 't35'\nNT13 \u2192 't4'\nNT4 \u2192 't34'\nNT88 \u2192 't5'\nNT25 \u2192 't25'\nNT42 \u2192 't24'\nNT63 \u2192 't32'\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up some of these.
