{"custom_id":"request-5","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t47\" is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is pretty large, with multiple production rules, so I should approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. Each rule is in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for CNF. The terminals are lowercase letters like 't', and I think 't14' indicates that the string to produce is something with indices. Wait, but in this case, I need to produce \"t47\", so I should see if there's a production that directly leads to that.\n\nLooking through the start symbol S, the first rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, to produce S, we need NT0 and NT4. So, the string \"t47\" must come from NT0 and NT4 or through their sub-productions.\n\nFirst, check NT4: NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6. So, NT4 is two non-terminals. Let's see if either of these can derive to t47.\n\nLooking at NT8, its production is NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3. So NT8 can become NT5 and NT3. Now, check NT5 and NT3.\n\nNT5 has rules: NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3. Let's see each.\n\nFirst, NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then, NT6 and NT7 need to derive to something. NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT0, and NT7 has multiple productions. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0 and NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6. This seems recursive, but perhaps we can find a direct production.\n\nLooking for t47: I notice that some rules directly have t as a terminal, like NT0 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc. So, for example, NT7 \u2192 't13' directly gives 't13'. Wait, but we need 't47'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I notice that NT4 \u2192 't37' is one of the rules. So if NT4 can derive directly to 't37', then our string is part of NT4. So, if the string is \"t47\", that's two characters, but if NT4 can produce 't37' and somehow we also get to 't' and another '47'? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The string is just \"t47\", which is one token. In the grammar, some of the terminals are exactly those strings, like NT0 \u2192 't23' and others. But \"t47\" doesn't appear as a terminal in any of the rules. Therefore, to get \"t47\", there must be a production rule where a non-terminal directly produces \"t47\". Looking through all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal produces \"t47\". Therefore, \"t47\" cannot be produced directly.\n\nSo, maybe the string \"t47\" can't be derived from the given grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the only way is if there's a sequence that results in that exact string through multiple steps, but since none of the production rules have \"t47\" as a terminal, it's impossible. Therefore, I think the answer is 'No'.\n\nAdditionally, checking other possibilities: perhaps NT4 \u2192 't37' and there's another NT4. But the string length is 3, which might come from three NTs? Hmm, but even so, none of the terminals directly give 't47'. So, I'm pretty sure 'No' is the answer because 't47' isn't in the list of terminal rules.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-0","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form, and I need to determine if the string \"t39\" can be generated by this grammar. Alright, let's break this down step by step because it looks a bit complex with all those rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule either as A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, all the rules seem to be in CNF since each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and each right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So that's good; CNF is manageable.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is \"t39\". So I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. Let's see what S produces. Looking at the productions, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S generates two non-terminals. Therefore, any derivation starting from S will have to split into these two parts.\n\nThe string is \"t39\", which is a single terminal symbol. Since S produces two symbols, \"t39\" must be the result of combining two parts. But \"t39\" is a single token, which suggests that maybe one of the parts is empty, but in this case, all the initial productions produce at least one non-terminal or terminal, so I don't think empty strings are allowed here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Since S produces NT0 NT4, the entire string must be the concatenation of whatever NT0 produces and whatever NT4 produces. So if the string is \"t39\", that means either NT0 produces \"t39\" and NT4 produces \u03b5, or vice versa. But looking at the given rules, I don't see any production for NT0 or NT4 that directly produces \u03b5. All the rules either produce two non-terminals or a terminal. So perhaps the only way is that one of the non-terminals leads to \"t39\" directly, and the other leads to something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see which non-terminals produce terminals. Scanning through the rules, I notice:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n\nWait, that's only a few terminals being produced directly. So maybe \"t39\" is not directly produced by any non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps it can be derived through a series of productions.\n\nBut looking more carefully, NT0 seems to have multiple rules. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (again)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nLooking at these, none directly produce \"t39\". So if \"t39\" is supposed to be part of the string, it has to come from a production chain that ends with \"t39\". Let's see if any NT can produce \"t39\".\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't53' (no)\n- NT4 \u2192 't32' (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 't13' (no)\n- NT9 \u2192 't43' (no)\n- Others like NT5, NT0, etc., don't seem to produce \"t39\".\n\nWait, maybe someone else does. Let me check all the possible NT productions:\n\nLooking through the list, the only direct terminals are those few I mentioned. For example, NT4 \u2192 't32', not 39. So none of them directly produce 't39'. Therefore, \"t39\" cannot be directly generated, but perhaps it can be part of a longer string that's generated by some combination.\n\nBut wait, the string we're evaluating is just \"t39\". So it has to be exactly one terminal. Since \"t39\" isn't directly produced by any non-terminal, it can't be generated by any derivation starting from S. Therefore, the string \"t39\" isn't in the language defined by this grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-20","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string `t73 t61` is generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but I think I can break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It looks like the grammar is using non-terminals that eventually produce terminal strings, which are the `t` followed by numbers, like `t73`. The starting symbol is `S`, and the production rules are all in the form A \u2192 BC, which is typical for Chomsky normal form.\n\nThe string given is `t73 t61`, which has two tokens separated by a space. So each `t` number must be the result of a production rule in the grammar. My goal is to see if each of these tokens can be derived from non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I need to find any non-terminals that produce either `t73` or `t61`. Let's list out the production rules that result in `t1` followed by numbers:\n\nFirst, I'll search through the rules for any NT (Non-Terminal) that produces a string ending with `t73` or `t61`.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> t43: Wait, no, looking deeper. For example, looking for NT7, I see that NT7 has some rules, like NT7 -> NT13. Then in another rule, NT7 -> NT6 NT0. Also, NT0 has many rules, some of which produce t23, t43, t73, etc.\n\nWait, let me look for production rules that directly produce t73 or t61.\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- I see NT3 -> t73: Yes, that's a production. So NT3 can produce `t73`.\n- What about t61? Looking again, I see NT6 -> t61? Let's check: Yes, looking at the rules, one of them is NT6 -> NT0 NT7, but that's not directly producing t61. Wait, no, I think I might have missed it.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> t61: Wait, no, actually, I need to look for the exact production. Let me scan through each rule.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT0 -> t61: No, actually, looking at the initial rules, I don't see that. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- The rule for NT8 has NT8 -> t61 is there? Let me check: Yes, in the rules there's NT8 -> 't61'. So NT8 can produce `t61`. So to get `t61`, we need to have a production from NT8.\n\nSo, the string is `t73 t61`, so each token comes from a non-terminal. Let's map each token to their possible origin.\n\nFor `t73`, the rule is NT3 -> t73. So NT3 can produce `t73`.\n\nFor `t61`, the rule is NT8 -> t61. So NT8 can produce `t61`.\n\nNow, we need to see if the grammar allows `S` to derive `S`, and through some steps, produce `t73 t61`.\n\nSo the starting symbol is S. According to the first rule, S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S expands into NT0 NT4. The next step is to derive each of these.\n\nWe need to check if NT0 and NT4 can derive `t61` and `t73` respectively, but wait, actually, they might not directly, but perhaps through intermediate productions.\n\nWait, no. S -> NT0 NT4. So when we expand S, we get NT0 NT4. So to get `t73 t61`, we'd need NT0 to derive `t73` and NT4 to derive `t61`.\n\nBut let's check if NT0 can produce `t73` and NT4 can produce `t61`.\n\nBut looking at the rules, NT0 has multiple productions. For example:\n\nLooking at the rules for NT0:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- Wait, looking through the rules, there's NT0 -> NT7 NT6 (seems like multiple rules as written with different options).\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the NT0 productions:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5 (is this correct?)\n- Wait, perhaps I need to make a more systematic list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quickest way is to see for each NT0 and NT4's productions whether they can derive `t73` and `t61`.\n\nBut considering the time, perhaps it's better to approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, break down the string into two tokens: `t73` and `t61`.\n\nEach must be produced by a derived string from NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nWait, no. S expands to NT0 NT4. So for the string to be `t73 t61`, NT0 must produce `t73` and NT4 must produce `t61`. Or, more precisely, the concatenation of the two derivations must produce `t73 t61`.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\n- Can NT0 derive `t73`? Looking at NT0's rules, yes. Because NT0 has a production NT3, and NT3 has NT3 -> t73.\n\nWait, but can NT0 derive NT3?\n\nBecause the rules for NT0 are:\n\nLooking at each rule for NT0, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT6\n\nYes! There's a rule NT0 -> NT3 NT6.\n\nSo, if we take this production, then NT0 can become NT3 NT6.\n\nNow, to get `t73` from NT0, NT3 must eventually produce t73, and NT6 must produce something else? Or wait, no, because in the case of `t73 t61`, the entire string is two separate tokens, so both NT0 and NT4 must each derive a terminal string contributing one token.\n\nWait, no, because S produces NT0 NT4, and if NT0 produces `t73` and NT4 produces `t61`, then together they form `t73 t61`.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the derivation would be such that NT0 expands to `t73` and NT4 expands to `t61`, but they have to be connected through the production rules.\n\nWait, perhaps that's too simplistic. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the problem is more complex because the NT's can produce sequences of terminals and non-terminals, and the string must be a sequence of terminal symbols equal to `t73 t61`.\n\nSo, let me consider each part separately.\n\nFirst, `t73` must come from some NT0 production, but NT0 can reach `t73` via NT3.\n\nSo, let's outline a possible derivation:\n\nS (start symbol) -> NT0 NT4\n\nThen, NT0 can produce NT3 NT6. So S becomes NT3 NT6 NT4.\n\nNow, NT3 produces t73, so NT3 -> t73.\n\nSo, now we have t73 NT6 NT4.\n\nNT6 can produce t61 via one of its productions? Wait, looking back, no, NT6's rules include something like NT6 -> t61, right?\n\nYes, in the rules, there's NT8 -> t61. But wait, NT6 can produce t61? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT6:\n\nYes, for example, I see NT6 -> t61.\n\nWait, let me check the specific rules for NT6:\n\nLooking through, I see NT6 -> t61, but wait, looking more carefully, in the initial rules, one of the rules is NT6 -> t61. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, in the list provided, I find the following rule:\n\nNT6 -> t61.\n\nSo NT6 can directly produce t61.\n\nBut wait, since in the production S -> NT0 NT4, after expanding NT0 to NT3 NT6, we have NT3 NT6 NT4.\n\nThen, NT3 would produce t73, NT6 would produce t61, and NT4\u2014what does NT4 produce?\n\nNT4's rules include NT4 -> t62, but more importantly, to get `t61`, would NT6 produce it? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming NT6 produces `t61`. Let me check the rules again.\n\nLooking back: NT6 -> t61 is present.

{"custom_id":"request-21","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t64 t51`. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. CNF means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, except that B and C can't both be non-terminals if A is a non-terminal that can produce terminals. All start symbols must be on the left side, and the start symbol must be S. Wait, looking at the grammar, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. All other productions seem to follow the rule of producing two non-terminals except some which produce terminals directly, like NT2 \u2192 't7' and others.\n\nSo, in this grammar, each production is either a single non-terminal on the left or two on the right, except for the terminals which are directly produced. So, this is a straightforward CNF grammar.\n\nNow, the input string is `t64 t51`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I might need to perform a parse tree construction or apply some algorithm like the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm, but since I'm just thinking through this, I'll try to see if I can find a path from the start symbol S to this string.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So, S is a non-terminal that must produce two non-terminals. Therefore, each of S \u2192 NT0 NT4 must result in a string where each 'element' comes from either NT0 or NT4, which are non-terminals themselves.\n\nNext, I need to see what NT0 and NT4 produce. Checking the productions:\n\nNT0 has multiple productions, but I'm more interested in those that result in terminals. Scanning through, I see NT0 \u2192 't23', which is a terminal. So, NT0 can produce 't23', but in our string, we have 't64' and 't51', so that's not immediately useful.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has several productions. Looking for terminals: NT4 \u2192 't32' and NT4 \u2192 't5'. So, NT4 can produce either 't32' or 't5'. So, the 't51' in our string doesn't match either, which is problematic because our string has 't51' at the end. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm looking at all the productions for NT4:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT3,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT6 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT2,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT0 NT6,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT0,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT7,\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7,\n\nWait, but I think I misread this. Looking again, the grammar seems very extensive with many rules, some possibly redundant. For example, NT4 \u2192 't37' and NT4 \u2192 't5'. So in the productions, NT4 can produce 't37' and 't5' directly.\n\nWait, looking through, I see lines like:\n\nNT4 -> 't37'\n\nand\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\nSo NT4 can produce either 't37' or 't5'. So in our string, we have 't51', which isn't directly produced by NT4. That suggests that perhaps the string isn't generated, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps 't51' is the result of combining multiple non-terminals through production rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is constructed by a series of steps where intermediate non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and ultimately into terminals. So, perhaps 't64' and 't51' come from different paths.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's see what produces 't64'. Checking the productions for each non-terminal that could lead to a terminal, like NT6. Looking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 't83', 't43', 't77', 't61', 't11', etc. So 't64' isn't directly produced by NT6. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Checking NT6 productions:\n\nLooking through, I see NT6 \u2192 't77', NT6 \u2192 't43', etc., but no 't64'. Hmm, so perhaps 't64' isn't directly produced by any nt. Wait, but perhaps 't64' is produced by another path. Let me check NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't37' and NT4 \u2192 't5'. Wait, that doesn't help with 't64'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong NT. Let's think about where 't64' could come from. Looking at the productions, perhaps NT8 could produce 't64' because in the grammar, there's a production like NT8 \u2192 't56'. Hmm, no, that's not. Wait, in the given productions, looking for NT producing 't64':\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT6 \u2192 't83' and 't77', and 't64' is not among them. Wait, but perhaps 't64' comes from another pathway via intermediate non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the overall structure of the grammar and see which terminals are being used.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the terminals seem to be a list: 't14', 't20', 't21', 't22', 't23', 't26', 't27', 't28', 't29', 't31', 't32', 't33', 't37', 't39', 't40', 't42', 't43', 't44', 't45', 't47', 't51', 't53', 't54', 't56', 't57', 't58', 't60', 't61', 't62', 't63', 't64', 't67', 't70', 't71', 't72', 't73', 't74', 't75', 't76', 't77', 't78', 't79', 't80', 't81', 't83', 't84'. Wait, but in our string, we have 't64' and 't51'. So 't51' is present, but 't64' is also present. \n\nWait, but let's look more closely at NT8. For NT8, the productions include something like NT8 \u2192 't5', 't56', etc. Wait, there's NT8 \u2192 't56' and NT8 \u2192 't84'. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, looking at NT6 \u2192 't83' and 't77', so 't64' isn't directly produced. But perhaps 't64' is produced by another path. Alternatively, perhaps 't64' is not present at all, making the string ungrammatical.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to figure out how each terminal in the string can be generated.\n\nLet's consider the string 't64 t51'. That's two terminals: 't64' and 't51'.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Both NT0 and NT4 need to produce their respective terminals.\n\nSo, we need to see if there exists a way for NT0 to produce 't64' and NT4 to produce 't51', or vice versa, but since the order is fixed as NT0 then NT4, because S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the string must be a concatenation of NT0's production followed by NT4's.\n\nSo, first, can NT0 produce 't64'? Looking through NT0's productions, do any of them lead to 't64'? Scanning through:\n\nNT0:\n\n- 't23'\n\n- 't9' (from NT3 \u2192 't9'?)\n\nWait, looking back, some productions have terminals but are under NT3, NT5, etc. So, looking carefully, I don't see NT0 producing any terminal directly except 't23' as one of the options. So NT0 can't produce 't64'.\n\nSimilarly, if NT4 is to produce 't64', but looking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4's rules go to various non-terminals and terminals, but the direct terminals they can produce are 't37' and 't5'.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it's structured in a way that makes parsing easier, but it might also have some complexities. \n\nFirst, I'll remember that in Chomsky normal form, every production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

Wait, no, actually, each application of a rule replaces one symbol with two, so we need to generate the string step by step by expanding symbols until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me outline the process. I'll try to break down each token.\n\n1. Let's see the first token, t73. Looking at the grammar, which production leads to t73? Scanning the rules, I notice NT7 can produce t73 via NT7 \u2192 t73? Wait, no, looking closer, I see:\n\nLooking through all the NT7 productions, do any of them produce t73? Let me check.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nHmm, not directly. Then looking at individual terminal productions under NT7:\n\nWait, the rules under NT7 are:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- Then looking further down, under NT7, there's a rule NT7 \u2192 't76'. Is that correct?\n\nWait, checking the provided grammar, I see a line:\n\n`NT7 -> NT4 NT0`\n\n`NT7 -> NT4 NT6`\n\nAnd then lower down:\n\n`NT7 -> 't76'`\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking back, the original grammar is long, but under NT7, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT6\n\nWait, but I also see:\n\n`NT7 -> 't76'`? Let me check again. Looking through the provided grammar lines, I can't find an NT7 -> 't76'. Wait, actually, looking carefully, I see:\n\nUnder NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nUnder NT3, I see:\n\n`NT3 -> 't72'`\n\nUnder NT4, there are several rules ending with 't3', 't14', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me look again:\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of grammar rules, and I've to scan them for t73, t28, t61.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to decompose the string into the possible leftmost derivations.\n\nThe string is three tokens: t73, t28, t61.\n\nFirst, let's see how each token can be derived.\n\nStarting with the first symbol after S: t73. But S is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So after expansion, the starting point is NT0 and NT4. We need to see how these can generate the tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the string as a sequence: t73 (from position 1), t28 (position 2), t61 (position 3).\n\nEach non-terminal needs to generate a part of the string.\n\nLet me approach this by considering how each token can be derived from the grammar's symbols.\n\nFirst, t73: Looking through the grammar, where can t73 come from? Let me search for any NT rules that produce t73.\n\nLooking through the rules, I spot:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72' (under NT3)\n- NT5 -> 't33' (since I see `NT5 -> 't33'`)\n- NS is S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nWait, I don't see t73 directly. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Alternatively, perhaps t73 comes from a production through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the NT7 productions result in t73. Let me look:\n\nLooking through the NT7 productions, I see:\n\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT6\n- Additionally, I see in other parts:\n\nWait, looking again, under NT7, there's a rule:\n\n`NT7 -> 't76'`? Let me check the provided grammar.\n\nLooking more carefully: The user provided the grammar, and one of the NT3 lines is:\n\n`NT3 -> 't72'`\n\nLooking further down, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, actually, the lines are:\n\nWait, the grammar provided includes several NT3 rules:\n\n- `NT3 -> 't72'`\n- `NT3 -> 't31'`\n- `NT3 -> 't53'`\n- `NT3 -> 't39'`\n- `NT3 -> 't32'`\n- `NT3 -> 't70'`\n- And more.\n\nI don't see 't73' directly. Hmm, maybe t73 isn't directly a terminal, but perhaps it's derived through a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. The user wrote the grammar lines with various -> NTx followed by another NTy. Maybe in the production rules, any of these sequences end up with t73.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm focusing on the wrong NT. Alternatively, maybe t73 comes from an NT that I'm not seeing as terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which NT can produce t73.\n\nWait, looking through the provided grammar, I see a production:\n\n`NT6 -> 't83'` and under NT3:\n\nCheck lines:\n\nWait, actually, looking for a rule that ends with t73. Let me scan the provided lines:\n\nIn the provided grammar, under NT7, there's a line:\n\n`NT7 -> 't76'` (I think not, because in the initial lines, under NT7, I see `-> NT4 NT6` and `-> NT4 NT0`, but further down, under NT3:\n\nLooking through all the user-provided strings, I can't find t73 as a terminal. Wait, perhaps t73 comes from another NT.\n\nWait, perhaps looking through other production rules, I can find which NTs can produce t73.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by seeing how each token can be derived from the start.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too short, so perhaps it's impossible, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can't be generated because certain symbols can't expand to that. For example, maybe the first token, t73, isn't possible. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\n- 't14' (NT2)\n- 't28' (NT7 via other paths)\n- 't3' (NT4)\n- 't7' (NT2)\n- 't11' (NT8)\n- 't14' again\n- 't21' (NT8)\n- 't28' also as a result perhaps elsewhere\n- 't32' (NT3)\n- 't33' (NT5)\n- 't37' (NT3)\n- 't43' appears as multiple NT3 and NT5 rules.\n- 't47' (NT7)\n- 't5' (NT0)\n- 't53' (NT3)\n- 't54' (NT7)\n- 't60' (NT8)\n- 't62' (NT4)\n- 't67' (NT8)\n- 't70' (NT5)\n- 't72' (NT3)\n- 't73' is not present.\n- 't74' (NT6)\n- 't76' (is this present? I'm checking and perhaps not directly. Wait, under NT3, I see `NT3 -> 't70'` and others, but t73 isn't there.\n- 't77' (NT6)\n- 't80' (NT0)\n- 't81' (NT8)\n- 't83' (NT6)\n- 't84' (NT5, NT6)\n- 't85' not found.\n- 't9' appears as a terminal, but I don't see it.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me carefully go through the user's provided grammar rules again to check if any NT directly produce 't73'.\n\nLooking through all lines:\n\nNo, the only terminals are the ones explicitly listed.

{"custom_id":"request-60","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the string \"t20 t9 t31 t27\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have production rules where each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and the string needs to be derived from S using these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most of the productions involve non-terminals leading to two other non-terminals. Some are terminals, like 't20', 't9', etc. So the string is a sequence of terminals; my goal is to see if this sequence can be produced by combining these rules.\n\nLet me break down the string: t20, t9, t31, t27. So each token should come from some production path ending in that terminal.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, t20. Looking at the rules for NT20. Hmm, but wait, I don't see a NT20 in the productions. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I see that some N terminals like NT1, NT2, etc., map to 't' symbols. Wait, no. Let me check the rules.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me parse the grammar correctly. Each production has the form NTx -> something. The terminals are written as 't' followed by a number. For example, NT4 -> 't37'. So each terminal is 't' followed by two digits, like t20, t9, etc.\n\nSo, the string \"t20 t9 t31 t27\" is four terminals. Let me think about how these could be generated.\n\nEach terminal in the string must correspond to a production where the left-hand side is a non-terminal that eventually produces that terminal. So, for example, to get t20, we need a production NT20 -> 't20', but I don't see any NT20 in the grammar. Wait, looking through the rules, each non-terminal seems to produce other non-terminals until it eventually reaches a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again. Each production is NTx -> NTa NTb, except for those that directly produce a terminal.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT2 -> 't7', NT9 -> 't60', but wait, no, in the given grammar, the terminals are like 't3', 't4', etc. Each terminal is represented as 't' followed by numbers. So, for example, NT2 -> 't7' is not correct because in the provided grammar, I see:\n\nLooking at some production rules:\n\nNT2 -> 't7'? Wait, no, the grammar provided has, for example, NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't47', etc. So each terminal is of the form 'tXX', where XX is a two-digit number.\n\nWait, but in the string, we have t20, t9, t31, t27. So 't9' is a single 't' followed by 9. But in the grammar, the terminals are written as 't32', 't73', etc., so all have two digits. So 't9' would be 't09'? Wait, but in the string, it's written as 't9', but the grammar produces 't' followed by two digits, possibly with leading zeros. Hmm, but in the string, it's \"t20 t9 t31 t27\". So perhaps 't9' is 't09' in the grammar. But 't9' in the string is 't9', which is inconsistent with the grammar's 'tXX' where XX are two digits. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the correct would be t09.\n\nBut assuming the string is correct, perhaps the 't9' is 't09' in the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar allows single-digit terminals, but that's unlikely because in CNF, all terminals must be single symbols, but in this case, it's unclear.\n\nWait, let's check the grammar's terminal productions. For example:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT5 -> 't27'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't39'\nNT0 -> 't52'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT6 -> 't83'\nNT8 -> 't11'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT4 -> 't84'\nNT7 -> 't43'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT8 -> 't84'\nNT8 -> 't81'\nNT0 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT4 -> 't27'\nNT0 -> 't62'\nNT2 -> 't26'\nNT3 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT5 -> 't15'\nNT7 -> 't33'\nNT8 -> 't64'\nNT6 -> 't77'\nNT6 -> 't43'\nNT8 -> 't56'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT8 -> 't73'\nNT7 -> 't76'\nNT6 -> 't61'\nNT2 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't69'\nNT4 -> 't70'\nNT0 -> 't12'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT7 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't7'\nNT8 -> 't57'\nNT2 -> 't63'\nNT9 -> 't79'\nNT8 -> 't53'\nNT8 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't51'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't62'\nNT3 -> 't8'\nNT7 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't52'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT6 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't35'\nNT6 -> 't67'\nNT8 -> 't77'\nNT4 -> 't42'\n\nWait, I'm looking for where a terminal is directly produced. For example, NT3 -> 't53' is a terminal, but in the string, we have t31, which would correspond to NT3 -> 't31'. Looking through the rules, NT3 does produce 't31' as per the fourth production: NT3 -> NT0 NT2, but wait, no, actually in the grammar, looking back, I think I might have misread some of the rules.\n\nWait, the grammar as provided seems to have multiple productions for each NT. For example, NT3 has several rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9\nNT3 -> NT5 NT6\nNT3 -> NT3 NT0\nNT3 -> NT3 NT7\nNT6 -> NT5 NT5\nAnd eventually, some of these lead to terminals.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look correctly. The given grammar has, for example:\n\nNT3 <- several productions, but some of them produce terminals:\n\nLooking again, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't53'\nWait, no. Let me scan through the entire grammar to find terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I find:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'? No, actually, in the given grammar, the productions are written as NTxxxx -> something. So NT2 -> 't7' is a productions, meaning that NT2 can produce the terminal 't7'.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 -> 't72', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's \"t20 t9 t31 t27\". So each 't' followed by two digits.\n\nLooking for where the non-terminals can produce these.\n\nFirst, 't20' corresponds to NT20 -> 't20', but looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT20. So that might not be possible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So perhaps 't20' is produced by NT20, but in the grammar, there's no production for NT20. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the indexes are off. Maybe in the grammar, some NTs are not directly producing terminals but require expansion.\n\nLet me check each symbol in the string:\n\n1. t20: Needs a production where NT20 -> 't20', but in the grammar, is there any NT20 with that production?

Let me check all the production rules where a terminal is on the right.\n\nAfter reviewing, I think I might have missed 't8' in a production. Let me check all NTs and terminals:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't54'\n- NT6 \u2192 't77'\n- NT6 \u2192 't43'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT4 \u2192 't27'\n- NT3 \u2192 't8' (Wait, I think I found it! Looking again, under the NT3 productions, I see \"NT3 -> 't8'\". Let me double-check.\n\nYes, in the grammar, under NT3's productions, there's \"NT3 -> 't8'\". So, NT3 can produce 't8'.\n\nSo now, the string parts are:\n\n1. 't8' \u2192 from NT3\n2. 't5' \u2192 from NT4 or NT8\n3. 't33' \u2192 from NT7\n4. 't73' \u2192 from NT8\n\nNow, the string is \"t8 t5 t33 t73\". So, each part corresponds to NT3, NT4\/NT8, NT7, and NT8, respectively.\n\nNow, the next step is to see if the grammar can derive this sequence. Since it's a Chomsky CNF grammar, each production is two non-terminals. But wait, the string has four terminals, which would require four production steps, each adding one terminal.\n\nBut let me think: Starting from S, which is NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, NT0 and NT4 each need to derive to a sequence that can combine to form the parts. But wait, S is a single non-terminal, and in one step it splits into two non-terminals. But the string has four parts, so each of these non-terminals would need to expand further.\n\nWait, the string is \"t8 t5 t33 t73\", which is four terminals. So each of these must come from a sequence of productions expanding S into four non-terminals, each of which derive to a terminal.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nEach of NT0 and NT4 can derive into two non-terminals, so each step doubles the number of non-terminals, but each can produce terminals.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the entire string as having four terminals, so the derivation would require starting from S and expanding four times, each time adding a terminal. But actually, in CNF, each production splits into two non-terminals, so the number of non-terminals increases each step, unless a non-terminal produces a terminal.\n\nBut in the string, all four parts are terminals. So each of the four non-terminals must ultimately derive a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet's see: The string is four terminals, so the derivation would require four steps of expanding non-terminals into terminals, but starting from S which is two non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be derived from some non-terminal, and then see if those non-terminals can be connected back to S.\n\nSo for \"t8\", it's from NT3.\n\nFor \"t5\", it's from NT4.\n\nFor \"t33\", it's from NT7.\n\nFor \"t73\", it's from NT8.\n\nSo the string is \"t8 t5 t33 t73\", which corresponds to NT3, NT4\/NT8, NT7, NT8.\n\nBut how do these connect? Since S is NT0 NT4, and both are non-terminals, they need to expand into sequences of non-terminals and terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should build the parse tree to see if it fits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each part of the string is derived from a separate path in the grammar.\n\nWait, but in Chomsky CNF, each production is either a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. So, to generate a string of four terminals, S would need to expand into four non-terminals via a series of productions, each adding one terminal.\n\nBut in the first step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Now, each of these needs to expand further. Let's see:\n\nNT0 can derive into NT6 NT7 (from NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7) or other non-terminals leading to terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can derive into NT8 NT6 or other paths.\n\nLet me try to map this out:\n\nWe have four terminals, so perhaps the derivation is structured as S \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 (A)(B) \u2192 (term1)(term2)(term3)(term4). But not exactly sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if each terminal can be reached by a path from S through the grammar.\n\nBut let's try to see for each terminal:\n\n1. \"t8\" comes from NT3: NT3 \u2192 't8'.\n\n2. \"t5\" can come from NT4: NT4 \u2192 't5' or NT8 \u2192 't5'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-88","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to determine whether the string `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21` is generated by the given context-free grammar. Hmm, first, I need to understand how context-free grammars work and how to check if a string is in the language defined by the grammar.\n\nThe grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That might make it a bit easier because CNF has a specific structure that can sometimes make parsing algorithms more efficient, but I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`. Each of these is a terminal symbol because they're in quotes and not starting with a capital letter like in the production rules. So I need to see if these terminals can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, and the production for S is `S -> NT0 NT4`. So S starts the derivation with NT0 and NT4. Therefore, the entire string must be a result of expanding NT0 and NT4 into terminal symbols.\n\nLet me note down the relevant parts of the grammar where NT0, NT4, and others produce terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' (among others)\n- NT4 -> 't27' (amazingly, this production is in there)\n- The NT symbols all have rules that eventually lead to terminals, but I need to see the path that leads to the given string.\n\nSo the string is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`. Let's break it down. Wait, no, the string is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`, which are five terms. So the derivation needs to produce five terminals, meaning multiple steps probably.\n\nWait, each production in CNF is two non-terminals, so the string must be built by combining these non-terminals until they are expanded into terminals.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One way is to try to parse the string backwards, seeing if it can be broken down using the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to build the string from the start symbol, expanding NT0 and NT4 step by step, but that might take a lot of steps, especially since I'm new to this.\n\nWait, another approach is to use the concept of a parse tree, where each node is a non-terminal, and leaves are terminal symbols. The string must match the leaves of the parse tree in order.\n\nSo, the string has to be built by combining the two non-terminals at each step according to the grammar.\n\nLet me try to see what the possible derivations could be. The string is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`. Let me note that t74 comes from NT0 -> 't74' according to the production.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' (one production)\n- NT0 also has other productions like `NT0 -> NT9 NT7`, `NT0 -> NT5 NT5`, etc.\n\nBut one of them leads directly to a terminal: `NT0 -> 't74'`. So if NT0 can produce 't74', then in the derivation, NT0 must be somehow expanded to that.\n\nBut how? Let's check where 't74' comes from. Yes, in the productions, NT0 has that.\n\nBut to get 't74' as the first symbol, the first expansion must involve NT0 producing a terminal. But NT0 has other productions that are still non-terminals, like NT6 NT7.\n\nSo, I think the initial step is to break down the string into parts. Maybe the string can be divided into two parts, each derived from the two non-terminals in S's expansion.\n\nWait, S starts with NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be the result of expanding NT0 and NT4 into two parts that, when concatenated, form the given string.\n\nSo, the string `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21` can be considered as a combination of two substrings, one from NT0's expansion and the other from NT4's expansion.\n\nLet me see what the possible endings for NT0 and NT4 can be.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see that there's NT4 -> 't27'. So the last part of the string, 't21', would have to be derived from NT4's expansion.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts. Let's say the first part is derived from NT0 and the second part from NT4.\n\nThe string is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`. Suppose the first part is the first two symbols, `t74 t53 t5 t47` would be from NT0 and the last part `t21` from NT4. Wait, no, the split should be into two parts because NT0 and NT4 produce two parts each.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the entire string as being produced by NT0 and NT4 expansions. So perhaps the string can be viewed as the concatenation of two parts: one from NT0's expansion starting at the beginning and ending somewhere before the last symbols, and the other from NT4's expansion starting from that point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built by NT0 and NT4. Let me reevaluate.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. The string starts with t74. Let's see which NT symbols can produce t74. From the grammar:\n\n- NT0 has `NT0 -> 't74'` in one of the productions.\n\nSo t74 must come from NT0. Therefore, the first symbol in the string must be from NT0's expansion as 't74'.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, NT0 has multiple productions, including some that combine NTs, and sometimes produce terminals. So, to get t74, NT0 must directly produce it as one of its rules.\n\nNow, the string is `t74 t53 t5 t47 t21`. The next symbol is t53, which must come from somewhere. Let's see where t53 can come from in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't immediately see any NT symbol that produces t53. Hmm. Wait, maybe t53 is not a terminal but derived from an NT symbol. Wait, no, the string consists of these terminals. So if t53 is a terminal, it must be matched by an NT symbol's production. Let me check if any NT symbol in the grammar has a production to 't53'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT1: wait, no, does the grammar have any NT producing t53? Wait, the given grammar's productions are all written as S -> NT0 NT4, NT7->..., etc., so perhaps the grammar's NT symbols don't have any production to t53. Wait, let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, some NTs produce various terminals, but I don't see any NT that produces 't53'. So that's a problem. Because if t53 is a terminal, then the grammar doesn't have any production for it, meaning it's impossible for the string to be in the language.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the grammar uses the non-terminals labeled with numbers, like NT0, NT1, etc., but in the string provided, the symbols are named with 't' followed by numbers, like 't74', 't53', etc. So, perhaps the non-terminals NTx correspond to the terminal symbols where 't' is prefixed, followed by some digits, e.g., NT74 corresponds to 't74', NT53 corresponds to 't53', etc.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar's productions, I don't see any NT symbol that directly corresponds to 't53'. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar has an NT called NT53 that produces 't53', but I didn't look through all the grammar's rules to see.\n\nWait, yes, I need to check every production in the grammar for any NT that produces 't53'. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- NT0: multiple productions, but none produce 't53', except possibly something like `NT0 -> 't23'`.\n- NT7: `NT7 -> 't14', 't13', etc.`\n- NT6: `NT6 -> 't9', 't7', 't8', etc.`\n- NT4 has `NT4 -> 't27'`, which could correspond to 't27', but not 't53'.\n- NT3: 't24', etc.\n- NT5: 't47', among others.\nWait, looking again:\n\nOh! The grammar has this production: `NT3 -> 't53'`. Because, in the given grammar, there's `NT3 -> 't53'`.\n\nSo NT3 can produce 't53'. So, the second symbol in the string is 't53', so that could be produced by NT3.\n\nSo, putting this together, let's try to build the parse tree"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which helps because all the rules are either starting symbols breaking into two other symbols or terminal symbols.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form has productions like A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The string given consists of t and numbers, so the terminals are \"t\" followed by a number.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals expand into \"t\" followed by another digit.

My goal is to see if each \"t\" in the string comes from one of these productions and follow the chain backward to see if we can reach the start symbol S.\n\nStarting with \"t12\". Looking through the rules, I find that NT2 -> \"t7\". Hmm, but \"t12\" doesn't directly match any. Wait, maybe I need to trace back. NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT6, and NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8.

Each of these must come from a production where the non-terminal on the left can derive into that number-terminal.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT3->t72, NT5->t47, NT7->t13, NT0->t23, etc. So each terminal is part of a production rule.\n\nI'll try to break down each token:\n\n1. t12: Where does this come from? Looking for any NT that directly produces t12. Maybe not, so maybe t12 comes from a longer path, like NT8->t5 (from NT8->t5 as one option). Wait, no. Actually, looking at NT8's rules: NT8->NT5 NT6. Maybe t8 eventually becomes t5 and t6, which then become t-something else.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to approach this by constructing a parse tree in reverse. Starting from the string and seeing where the non-terminals can come from.\n\nThe string is t12 t2 t63 t11 t42. Let's reverse it: t42 t11 t63 t2 t12.\n\nNow, I need to see if each \"t\" and number can be matched by a production's right-hand side.\n\nt42: Looking at the rules, NT0->t43, NT5->t47, NT7->t54, etc. Wait, NT4 has a rule NT4->t32, which is t32, not t42. Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, is there a production that produces t42?\n\nWait, in the rules, NT9->t20, NT5->t3, NT7->t17, so maybe not directly. I might need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list out all possible ways each tX can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can work forward from S. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, each of these can be non-terminals. Let's try to see how NT0 and NT4 can produce the first t.\n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check step by step each token.\n\nLet me take each token and see if it can be generated by some rule.\n\n1. t12: Looking through the rules, I don't see any non-terminal directly producing t12. So t12 must come from a non-terminal that eventually expands to it. Let's see if any of the non-terminals derive into t12.\n\nLooking at NT0 rules:\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- etc.\n\nWait, none of these directly produce t12. So perhaps t12 comes from a chain. For example, NT6 can produce NT9 NT8, which might further expand.\n\nWait, let's see: NT6 can expand to NT9 NT8. So perhaps t12 is from NT6 -> NT9 NT8, and then each of those expand further. Let's trace:\n\nNT9 might go to NT5 NT6, and NT8 goes to NT5 NT3, perhaps.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Alternatively, maybe I should build a parse tree for the given string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that all tokens must belong to the language generated by the grammar. So for each token, I can represent it as a non-terminal that either is a terminal or has productions.\n\nWait, let me check each token:\n\nt12: I need to see if any non-terminal's production includes t12 as part of the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\nLooking at NT4: several rules, but none directly produce t12. Similarly for other NTs.\n\nWait, maybe t12 comes from a longer path. For example, NT8 can produce NT5 NT6. If NT5 produces t47 (t47?), but wait, NT5's production is NT5->t47. So t47 is t4 followed by 7. So t47 would correspond to \"t47\". But in our string, we have \"t12\", which is \"t1\" followed by \"2\". Hmm. No, wait, the string is \"t12\" which is a single token, so it's t followed by 12.\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal A has A \u2192 t12 B or similar. But looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t followed by 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation. If the string is \"t12 t2 t63 t11 t42\", does each \"t\" concatenate with the number, so for example, \"t12\" is the same as \"t\" followed by \"12\", and the entire thing is a terminal symbol.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, none of the rules have a production for a single terminal like \"t12\". So this suggests that \"t12\" is not a terminal, which would mean that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the grammar doesn't have a production that produces \"t12\" as a single token.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Because perhaps \"t12\" is generated through a chain of productions. For example, NT0 might produce NT6 NT7, and NT6 might produce NT9 NT8, and NT8 might produce NT5 NT3, etc. Let me see if the t12 can be broken down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is made up of several t and numbers, but each t must come from a non-terminal that can produce it directly or through a chain. But since \"t12\" is not a terminal in the grammar, and I don't see any production that results in \"t12\", it's impossible for \"t12\" to be part of the derived string.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the rules again. For example, NT4 has a rule NT4->t84, but t84 is different. NT4 also has rules like NT4->t84, but it's part of a chain. Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach: Each token in the string must correspond to a production that ends in terminals. So, in other words, when we parse the string, each step in the parsing must produce a terminal symbol. Therefore, each token in the string must be generated by some production in the grammar's right-hand side without any other non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the tokens: t12, t2, t63, t11, t42.\n\nI need to check if each of these can be produced by some production in the grammar.\n\n- For t12: Is there a non-terminal A such that A \u2192 t12? Looking at the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, but that doesn't help. Wait, but none of the productions seem to have t12 as a result. So t12 cannot be a direct terminal; it must be part of a deeper production.\n\nBut wait, if t12 is a terminal, then it must be a single token. So, in the grammar, is there any non-terminal that directly produces t12? Looking through the productions:\n\nLooking for all the rules, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal A is replaced by t12 and another symbol. So A must produce t12B, but then t12B would involve t12 followed by some B, but in the string, it's just t12 as a single token. Therefore, t12 cannot be derived directly, so the string"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar to see all the production rules. The grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT4, so the entire string should be derived from this start symbol. That means the string must eventually break down into these terminals from S.\n\nLooking at the string, it's six tokens: t56, t26, t24, t35, t35, t31. I'll need to see if each token can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLet me list the production rules relevant to each token. For example, t56 is derived from NT4. Looking at the grammar, NT4 can produce NT8 NT6. Then, NT8 might produce other non-terminals, which in turn produce more, until we reach a terminal.\n\nStarting with t56:\n\n1. t56 comes from NT4.\n2. NT4 -> NT8 NT6.\n3.

So t56 must come from NT8 or NT6. Wait, no. Actually, t56 is a terminal, so we need a chain of productions that starts with NT4, which produces NT8 and NT6. Then each of these must produce something that ends in t56.\n\nWait, no, t56 is a single terminal, so we need to see if there's a path where a non-terminal directly produces t56. Looking at the rules, I see NT6 can produce t77, but not t56. Let me check all the rules for t56.\n\nWait, here's a rule: NT8 -> t5? Let me check. Hmm, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT8 -> t64?

But since I'm a bit rusty, I'll try to think through.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, so every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So the leftmost symbol in a derivation must be replaced first.\n\nSo starting with S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nSo the string must be derived from NT0 and NT4. Each of these non-terminals will generate their parts of the string.\n\nLet me check if NT0 can generate t56.

Wait, in the given rules, some non-terminals directly go to terminals. Let me list them:\n\nThe rules where A -> a, with a a terminal:\n\nNT3 -> t72\nNT5 -> t47\nNT7 -> t13\nNT2 -> 't14\nNT9 -> 't43\nNT8 -> 't5\nNT4 -> 't32\nNT7 -> 't54\nNT4 -> 't5\nNT0 -> 't23\nNT5 -> 't3\nNT4 -> 't8\nNT3 -> 't53\nNT8 -> 't21\nNT4 -> 't84\nNT4 -> 't9\nNT3 -> 't51\nNT8 -> 't84\nNT8 -> 't81\nNT0 -> 't28\nNT4 -> 't7\nNT4 -> 't27\nNT0 -> 't62\nNT2 -> 't26\nNT3 -> 't24\nNT9 -> 't44\nNT5 -> 't15\nNT7 -> 't33\nNT8 -> 't64\nNT6 -> 't77\nNT6 -> 't43\nNT8 -> 't56\nOh, wait!

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the start symbol which can have more. Let's start by understanding the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite large, but I notice that each rule ends up expanding into a pair of symbols. Some start symbols produce terminal strings. For example, I see rules like `NT2 -> 't7'`, which directly translates a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nThe string given consists of a sequence of terminal symbols: t60, t54, t13, t23, t63, t20. So the task is to see if the start symbol S can derive this sequence.\n\nI'll approach this step by step.\n\n1. **Start with S**: According to the grammar, S produces NT0 NT4. So the first step is to split the string into two parts that correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\n2. **NT0**: Looking at the grammar, NT0 can derive various things. Looking at the rules, NT0 can go to NT9 NT7, NT6 NT7, NT5 NT5, etc. I'll need to see which path could lead to the first part of the string, t60, t54.\n\nWait, the string starts with t60.

Wait, no, looking again, I see NT6 -> 't83' which is t83. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, actually, looking through the rules, I find that NT6 can produce 't61', but that's t61. Wait, am I looking correctly? Or maybe t60 comes from another place.\n\nWait, looking back at the rules, the string has t60. Are there any rules that produce t60? Let me look. Hmm, I don't see a production where a non-terminal directly produces t60. So I must find a non-terminal that can derive t60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t60 comes from a chain of productions. Let me think recursively.\n\nIf the entire string is t60 t54 t13 t23 t63 t20, maybe each of these corresponds to a terminal production from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string corresponds to a leftmost derivation.\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo NT0 needs to derive t60...something, and NT4 needs to derive t54...something.\n\nBut since the first token is t60, let's see what NT0 can become.\n\nLooking at NT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- etc.\n\nWait, t60. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces t60. Looking through the rules, I don't see any rule where NTx directly produces t60. So perhaps t60 comes from a longer chain.\n\nLooking for NT6, because in one of the rules, NT6 can go to 't61', but that's t61, not t60. Wait, checking the rules again. Maybe I missed one. Let's see: NT6 -> 't61', which isn't helpful. Wait, is there a rule for NT6 that leads to more non-terminals which eventually produce t60?\n\nAlternatively, maybe t60 is produced by NT9? Let me check NT9 rules. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't52' which is t52. That doesn't help. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t60 comes from an earlier rule, but I think I might be missing something. Wait, in the rules, perhaps NT3 can produce some t... Let me check NT3 rules. Looking through, I see NT3 \u2192 't31', which is t31, not t60. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the initial S splits into NT0 and NT4, which then each split further. Let's think about how the first element could be t60.\n\nIf NT0 can produce t60 via a chain, but none of the direct rules produce t60, perhaps the non-terminal is derived through a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe t60 is produced by a non-terminal that I'm not seeing.\n\nWait, checking all the rules, I see NT2 -> 't7', NT3 -> 't72', which is t72. NT5 -> 't27', etc. I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t60.\n\nHmm, so maybe the string can't be generated because there's no rule for a non-terminal to directly produce t60. Let me check another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the rules. Let me check again for any rules that result in t60.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't61' (t61)\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT5 \u2192 't15', 't27', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't72', 't70', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any rule that directly produces t60. So perhaps the string isn't in the language because one of the components can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the split happens. Let me think again: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string should be split into NT0 part followed by NT4 part. The first part of the string is t60 followed by other tokens. Let me see if the first segment can be NT0 and the second NT4.\n\nBut if NT0 can't produce t60, then perhaps the entire string isn't derivable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too short. The given string has 6 tokens. But the grammar has to derive 6 symbols each as either non-terminals or terminals. Wait, each step of the derivation may increase the number of non-terminals, but in the end, all are terminals.\n\nBut in our case, the string has 6 terminals, so the total number of symbols should be 6. Let me see if each production rule as per the grammar can generate 6 symbols.\n\nWait, S starts as NT0 NT4. So that's 2 symbols. Then each NT0 and NT4 will produce more, but eventually, each derivation step should replace a non-terminal into two non-terminals until the leaves are terminals.\n\nBut if S starts as NT0 NT4, each of these can be expanded into more non-terminals, but eventually, they must all produce terminals.\n\nBut given that the string has 6 terminals, perhaps the derivation requires that the start produces 5 splits each resulting in a terminal. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue is that the string includes t60, which I can't find a way to produce from the grammar.\n\nSo, putting it all together, given that there's no rule producing t60, the string can't be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-125","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out whether the string \"t37 t37 t13 t5 t7 t40 t28\" is generated by the given context-free grammar. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which simplifies parsing but might make it a bit tricky manually.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the production rules to keep track of them. The grammar has a lot of rules, so I'll go through them one by one to understand how each terminal ('t' followed by a number) is generated.\n\nLooking at the rules, many of them start with NT followed by two other NTs, except for the ones where the right-hand side directly produce a terminal. For example, NT0 -> 't23', which is a leaf in the derivation tree.\n\nNow, the string in question is \"t37 t37 t13 t5 t7 t40 t28\". Each 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so for the string to be in the language, we need to find a way to derive it step by step using the grammar.\n\nLet me break down the string into parts:\n\n1. t37\n2. t37\n3. t13\n4. t5\n5. t7\n6. t40\n7. t28\n\nI need to check if each of these can be derived from the grammar, possibly in sequence.\n\nStarting with the first t37: Looking at the rules, where does t37 come from?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 -> 't37' (rule NT4 -> 't37'). So t37 comes directly from NT4.\n\nSo the first part, t37, can be derived as NT4.\n\nBut then, the string starts with another t37, so the second t37 must come from another NT4. So we have two NT4s in a row.\n\nNow, looking at the rules, where is NT4 produced? Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 -> NT4 NT3 (rule NT4 -> NT4 NT3) and NT4 -> NT5 NT2 (rule NT4 -> NT5 NT2). Also, there's NT4 -> NT8 NT6, but that's not relevant here since 't37' comes directly from NT4, but those other rules for NT4 are for building up larger terms.\n\nSo, to derive 't37 t37', we can use NT4 NT4. So starting with S -> NT0 NT4, which would produce something like NT0 followed by NT4. But to get two NT4s, perhaps the NT0 needs to generate an NT4 elsewhere.\n\nWait, S -> NT0 NT4. For the first part, maybe NT0 produces something that can eventually lead to another NT4. Let's check.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, one of them is NT0 -> NT5 NT5 (from earlier, but I'm not sure about the line numbering). Wait, I need to list out all NT0's rules:\n\nLooking back, the NT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT0\n- NT0 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT8\n- etc. (It seems there are multiple rules for NT0, but some are duplicates or combinations.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all the NT0 production rules to see.\n\nFrom the given rules, after the initial S: NTo rules are:\n\n1. NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n2. NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n3. NT0 -> NT9 NT0\n4. NT0 -> NT7 NT9\n5. NT0 -> NT0 NT8\n6. NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n7. NT0 -> NT5 NT5 (duplicate, line 53 and 55)\n8. NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n9. NT0 -> NT9 NT2\n10. other NT's have rules but perhaps not directly impacting NT0.\n\nSo, for example, NT0 can generate NT6 and NT7, leading to t23 and t33? Wait, no: NT6 and NT7 each produce certain terminals.\n\nWait, let's check which NTs produce which terminals:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't70' (line X)\n- NT5 -> 't43' (line X)\n- NT7 -> 't13' (line X)\n- NT4 -> 't37' (line X)\n- NT0 -> 't23' (line X)\n- NT2 -> 't7' (one of the lines, but in the later rules, it's 't7')\nWait, no: for example, looking at line 13: NT9 -> 't60'\n\nSo, each NT is associated with a specific terminal:\n\nLet me make a list mapping each NT to its terminal:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\n1. S -> NT0 NT4 (but NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals)\n2. NT7 -> NT0 NT2 (so NT7 is non-terminal; can also produce 't13')\n3. NT6 -> 't83' (line 6: NT6 -> 't83')\n4. NT8 -> 't5' (line 57: NT8 -> 't5')\n5.

NT7 -> 't14' (No, looking through the rules, I don't see that; perhaps confusion elsewhere. Wait, let's check each RHS:\n\nLooking line by line:\n\n- NT7 -> 't14' (line not found in the given rules; perhaps I misread).\n\nWait, the actual rules provided include lines like:\n\nNT0 -> 't23', etc. So perhaps each NT has at least one rule that directly produces a terminal.\n\nIn any case, the key point is that for each 't' in the string, we can find an NT that produces it.\n\nNow, the string has the following 't's:\n\nt37, t37, t13, t5, t7, t40, t28.\n\nWe need to find derivations for each of these.\n\nStarting with t37:\n\n- From the rules, NT4 -> 't37' (one of the lines: line X where NT4 -> 't37'), so t37 can be derived as NT4.\n\nNext, t37 again: same as above, another NT4.\n\nThen, t13: looking for which NT produces 't13'.

{"custom_id":"request-127","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t24 t84 t70 t14 t9 t56 t67\". I'm going to start by looking at the grammar provided and see how these tokens can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nFirst, looking at the production rules, the start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4. \n\nNow, I need to see if I can derive the given string from this. The string consists of seven tokens, so it's a sequence of seven terminal symbols. Since each production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal, the length of the string should be 2^k -1 for some k. Let's check: the string length is 7, which is 2^3 -1, so that's possible. So it's possible for a string of 7 terminals to be generated from S.\n\nNext, I should try to construct a parse tree or at least outline the steps of how the string can be generated. Let's break down the tokens step by step.\n\nLooking at the tokens: t24, t84, t70, t14, t9, t56, t67.\n\nI notice that t24 is one of the terminals, and I should check where it's defined. Looking through the productions, I see that NT3 \u2192 't24' and another production for NT3 is NT5 NT9. So t24 could come from NT3.\n\nSimilarly, t84 is another terminal. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't84' and another production for NT4 is NT8 NT6. So t84 can come from NT4, which can go to NT8 NT6 or directly as 't84'.\n\nLooking at t70, that's NT7, which can go to NT4 NT0 or other non-terminals. Alternatively, I see that NT7 \u2192 NT13, but looking back, I think I might have miscounted; actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see NT7 has several productions, including NT4 NT0 and NT5 NT6, etc. But t70 is another terminal, which comes from NT7: yes, because one of the productions for NT7 is NT7 \u2192 't70'.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. The productions for NT7 include NT4 NT0 and NT5 NT6, but I don't see 't70' as a direct production. Wait, looking through the provided grammar, under NT7, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nNT7 -> NT6 NT9\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So maybe I need to correct that. So in the given grammar, NT7 has three productions: NT4 NT0, NT4 NT6, and NT6 NT9. So 't70' is not a direct production from NT7. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, looking back at the provided grammar, for NT7, the productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nNT7 -> NT6 NT9\n\nSo none of these directly produce 't70'. So that suggests that t70 comes from some other non-terminal. Looking through the other productions, I see that NT70 is not present. Wait, actually, in the provided grammar, under NT7, there's no direct production for 't70'. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check all the productions for each non-terminal to see how each token can be produced.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's try a different approach. Instead of trying to directly map each token, let's see if each token can be derived from the appropriate non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo we have NT0 and NT4 on the left side.\n\nNow, the string is seven tokens, so each non-terminal might be expanding into a number of tokens.\n\nLet me think about how each non-terminal can produce the tokens.\n\nLooking at the tokens:\n\nt24 is produced by NT3.\n\nt84 is produced by NT4.\n\nt70 is produced by NT7? Wait, no, because in the provided grammar, NT7's direct productions don't include 't70'. So maybe it's another way. Looking at NT7, the productions are NT4 NT0, NT4 NT6, and NT6 NT9. So to get t70, perhaps one of those non-terminals produces it. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part of the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The initial grammar: \n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT7\n\nWait no, looking at the provided grammar, after S, it's NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nWait, no, the initial grammar as provided is a bit confusing. Let me list the relevant parts.\n\nFor NT7, the productions are:\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nNT7 -> NT6 NT9\n\nWait, no, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck:\n\nThe initial grammar in the problem is as follows:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT7\n\nWait no, looking at the problem statement, the grammar has lines like:\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nNT7 -> NT6 NT9\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading. Let me go through each line:\n\nLooking at NT7:\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nWait, is that correct? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the initial lines after S are:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for each terminal in the string to see which non-terminal can produce them.\n\nSo let's list the tokens again:\n\nt24, t84, t70, t14, t9, t56, t67.\n\nNow, checking each token:\n\n- t24: Looking for where NT3 is defined. In the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't24', so yes.\n\n- t84: NT4 \u2192 't84'.\n\n- t70: I need to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't70'. Looking through the given NT definitions, I don't immediately see 't70' as a terminal. Wait, did I miss it? Let me scan the NT productions again.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT3: NT3 \u2192 't39' and some other combinations, but no 't70'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me look again. The user provided a long list, perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the provided grammar: yes, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't70'? Or is it NT7 -> NT7 NT0? Wait, no, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't57'\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting the NT7 productions wrong. Alternatively, maybe t70 comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT8: NT8 -> 't5', so t5 is a terminal from NT8.\n\nBut our string has t70, which is a longer token. Wait, perhaps the 't70' is actually 't24' combined with something? That doesn't make sense because each token is a single character (using 't' followed by a number as terminals).\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake. Let me clarify: each token in the string is either a single terminal, like 't24', or a combination. Since the grammar uses separate non-terminals, each terminal is a single token. So each 't' followed by a number is a single terminal symbol. Therefore, in the string, we have individual tokens like 't24', 't84', etc.\n\nSo, looking back, each terminal is a single token. Therefore:\n\nt24: must come from NT3's production NT3 \u2192 't24'.\n\nt84: comes from NT4's production NT4 \u2192 't84'.\n\nt70: Now, looking in the provided grammar, perhaps I missed it. Let me check again. Looking through the list, I see things like NT8 \u2192 't5', NT0 \u2192 't23', etc., but no direct 't70'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

{"custom_id":"request-147","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string `t43 t12 t20 t52 t64 t23 t7 t67` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form looks like. It has rules where each left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side has either two non-terminals or a terminal. In this case, the grammar seems to be more complex with more rules, so I might need to parse the string to see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which looks like it's rewritten as NT0 NT4. NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals, so the string must ultimately derive from these. The string provided has several terminals, so I'll need to see if each part of the string can correspond to the rules.\n\nThe string is `t43 t12 t20 t52 t64 t23 t7 t67`. I notice that some of these are terminals, but not all. Wait, looking closer, each terminal is something like 't43', 't12', etc. I think these might correspond to specific productions in the grammar.\n\nI'll list out each terminal in the string: t43, t12, t20, t52, t64, t23, t7, t67. There are eight symbols here. Let's think about the start symbol S, which is NT0 NT4, so the initial parse tree would have two branches from NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut wait, the string is made up of eight terminals. Each NT production might lead to several terminals. Let me see. For example, NT0 -> NT9 NT7, which leads to two non-terminals, but in the string, we have t23, which might come from a terminal production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar details, some non-terminals have rules that end with terminals. For example, NT5 -> 't33', NT3 -> 't72', and others. So each non-terminal can either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nSo, perhaps the string can be broken down into a series of productions. Let me try to map it.\n\nThe string starts with t43, which is 't43'. Looking at the grammar, 't43' corresponds to NT7. Let me check: NT7 -> 't43'. So the first symbol t43 can be produced by NT7.\n\nBut wait, NT7 is a non-terminal in the grammar. It appears in several rules, like NT7 -> NT13 NT33, but also has a rule NT7 -> 't43'. So t43 is a terminal rule for NT7.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second symbol t12, I need to find which non-terminal it corresponds to. From the grammar, NT10: NT10 -> 't43', which isn't t12. Wait, I don't see a rule for NT12 in the grammar, but the string has t12. Wait, did I miss any rules?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the terminal productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't72', 't76', 't53', etc.\nNT5 -> 't47', 't33', 't27', etc.\nNT6 -> 't83', 't77', etc.\nNT7 -> 't43', 't54', etc.\nNT8 -> 't11', 't5', 't57', etc.\nNT0 -> 't23', 't28', etc.\nNT2 -> 't7', 't26', etc.\nNT4 -> 't8', 't37', etc.\nAnd so on for each.\n\nWait, I'm seeing that the string has t12, but I don't immediately see a terminal rule for NT12. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I might have missed a terminal for NT12. Let me go through the list:\n\nChecking all the rules, I see that most of the NTs have either two non-terminals or a terminal. For example, NT2 -> 't7' and 't26', etc. Looking at NT3, there's a rule NT3 -> 't72', etc. But I don't see a 't12' as a terminal.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If the string includes 't12', but there's no rule in the grammar that directly produces 't12' from a non-terminal, then the string cannot be generated. Because every symbol in the string must come from either a terminal production or be generated by the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a rule. Let me re-examine the grammar provided. Looking at all the production rules, I don't see any non-terminal that has a terminal 't12' as a production. So that's a dead end. If the string contains 't12', but there's no production leading to 't12' from a non-terminal, then the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me check all the rules again carefully. The grammar has a list of productions ending with terminals, and I don't see 't12' as any terminal. For example:\n\nLooking at NT2, NT2 has rules NT2 -> 't7', 't26', etc. So there's no NT2 -> 't12'. Similarly, NT4 has rules like NT4 -> 't8', 't37', etc., but no 't12'. NT0 has 't23', 't28', etc. So I don't see any production for 't12'.\n\nWait, unless 't12' comes from multiple productions, but I don't think so. If 't12' isn't in any of the terminal productions, then the string can't be generated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I've misread the string. Let me check: the string is `t43 t12 t20 t52 t64 t23 t7 t67`. So yes, t12 is present. But no rule in the grammar produces t12. Therefore, the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let me make sure I didn't miss a rule that leads to 't12'. For example, NT5 has a rule NT5 -> 't27', but that's different. NT3 has 't72', etc. None of these include 't12'.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the string can't be generated because it includes 't12', which isn't present in any terminal production of the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the grammar structure. It starts with S -> NT0 NT4. So the entire string must start with what NT0 and NT4 can produce. NT4 has multiple productions, like NT4 -> NT8 NT6 or NT4 -> NT3 NT2. Wait, actually, looking again, NT4 appears in various rules, including NT4 -> t5 and other NT... rules. Wait, hold on, maybe NT4 is connected to terminal symbols.\n\nWait, I should list out all the grammar rules to see if any of them directly produce terminal 't's. Looking through, I see that NT4 has a rule NT4 -> t5. Also, NT3 has NT3 -> t72, NT5 -> t27, etc. So some of these non-terminals directly produce terminal strings.\n\nThe given string is: t80 t76 t77 t84 t22 t43 t31 t17.\n\nI think the approach here is to see if we can derive this string starting from S, using the given productions. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each production is either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, we can try to see if each 't' corresponds to a terminal derived from some NT.\n\nStarting with the string, perhaps I should break it down into parts that correspond to each step in the derivation.\n\nLet me note that S -> NT0 NT4, so the first symbol should come from NT0, and the next from NT4? Wait, no, because S produces NT0 NT4, which is two non-terminals, so the entire string will be the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT4 produces. So the first half of the string comes from NT0 and the second half from NT4.\n\nWait, the string is eight symbols long, so maybe each of NT0 and NT4 produce four symbols each? Let me check the possible lengths:\n\nLooking at NT0, do any of its productions produce a string of certain lengths? Possibly through multiple steps, but perhaps each symbol in the string represents a step in the derivation.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a direct production of some NT.\n\nLet me list the NTs and their possible terminal productions:\n\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT7 -> t13, t43\n- NT3 -> t72, t76, t77, t53, t24, t27, t54, t70, t37, t51, t70, t51, t53, t31, t57, t76, t70, t77, t79, t39, t31, t69, t57, t70, t79, t53, t37, t32, t54, t3, etc.\n- NT5 -> t47, t27, t62, t7, etc.\n- NT8 -> t5, t11, t56, t84, t81, etc.\n- NT0 -> multiple t's, like t23, t60, etc.\n- NT2 -> t7, t26, etc.\n- NT6 -> t83, etc.\n\nI think the key is to decompose the string into components that each NT can produce. Let me see, the string is t80 t76 t77 t84 t22 t43 t31 t17.\n\nWait, first, NT4 is part of S's expansion, so perhaps the string is split into two parts, the first part from NT0 and the second from NT4. Let's check if t80 t76 t77 t84 is from NT0 and t22 t43 t31 t17 from NT4.\n\nBut looking at NT4, it has a direct terminal production only for 't5' and others via longer paths. Wait, the direct products of NT4 include 't5', but t22, t43, etc., might come from longer derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a result of NT0 and NT4 each deriving a certain part, but I'm getting stuck.\n\nAnother approach is to try to see if each 't' in the string can be traced back through NTs that can produce it via their productions.\n\nFor example, t80: looking at the grammar, does any NT have a production that gives t80 directly? Looking through, I see NT0 -> t23, etc., but no direct t80. So it must be derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' in the string corresponds to a symbol produced by NTs that have a production for it, either directly or indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this string represents the result of a series of concatenations of NTs, each producing some terminal symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to see if the string can be broken into segments corresponding to each NT.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nStart with S -> NT0 NT4. So the first symbol must come from NT0, and the next from NT4? No, because NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals, so the entire string will be a concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT4 produces. So the string has to split into two parts, with the first part being the expansion of NT0 and the second the expansion of NT4.\n\nGiven the string length is 8, maybe each part is 4 symbols.\n\nSo let's split the string as (t80 t76 t77 t84) followed by (t22 t43 t31 t17).\n\nSo if I can derive each part from NT0 and NT4 respectively, then the string is generated.\n\nStarting with the first part: t80 t76 t77 t84.\n\nLet me see if t80 is from NT0. Looking for NT0 productions that lead to t80. But in the grammar rules, NT0 is produced by various NTs, but does any production of NT0 directly or indirectly result in t80?\n\nLooking through, all NT0 productions lead to various NTs, not directly to t80. So t80 must be part of a derivation from some NT that eventually produces 't80'.\n\nWait, in the grammar rules, is 't80' directly produced by any NT? Looking through the list, I don't see any NT having 't80' as a direct production. Therefore, 't80' must be part of a derivation from some NT that can eventually produce it via multiple steps.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to work backwards from 't80' to see if it can be reached through a chain of NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long, and each 't' is a symbol that results from an NT that eventually leads to it.\n\nThis seems complex, and I'm getting stuck. Perhaps a better approach is to recognize that without a full analysis of each production and possible steps, it's difficult to determine.

In CNF, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the case where a non-terminal can produce a terminal directly.

Hmm, wait, checking, under NT8, there are multiple rules. Let me find where NT8 leads to t56. \n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT8 -> t56? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT8 -> t5 (but that's via NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2, which goes to t5, where NT5 is handled.\n\nWait, let me go step by step.\n\nLooking for t83 in the grammar. Let's see the rules that produce t83.\n\nLooking through the end rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nLooking for t83:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t83 (Yes, under NT6, which is a production rule: NT6 \u2192 t83.\n\nWait, let me check the provided rules. Looking through the end productions, I see:\n\nNT6 -> t83? No, looking through:\n\nLooking for where a terminal starts with t83:\n\nLooking through all the end productions:\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT6 -> t83\n\nSo, NT6 can produce t83.\n\nAlso, does any other rule produce t83? Let me check:\n\nLooking for t83 anywhere as the right-hand side:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t83 is present.\n\nNo others, I think. Because as per the given rules, other non-terminals like NT7, NT0, etc., don't directly produce t83.\n\nSo, in the string, the first symbol is t83, which must come from NT6. So, during the parsing, one of the symbols in the current list of non-terminals must be NT6, and it produces t83.\n\nHmm, but in the case of CYK, the approach is to consider the symbols as terminals and see if they can be generated in the parse.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the string is a sequence of terminal symbols, and we need to see if they can be generated by expanding the start symbol S into a sequence that reduces to the given string.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to use memoization or a worklist approach, keeping track of the non-terminals that can produce certain strings.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a small string, let's try to see if each token can be matched starting from the beginning.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as a parse tree from the top down or bottom up.\n\nWait, perhaps a more straightforward approach is to see if each symbol can be matched as a production.\n\nLet me see the overall flow.\n\nThe string is: t83, t69, t2, t26, t76, t79, t13, t24, t70.\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, the leftmost symbol is t83, which must come from NT0, and the next symbol after that would come from NT4. Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing top-down and bottom-up parsing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps bottom-up is better. Starting from the string and trying to match from the end.\n\nWait, bottom-up parsing would attempt to match the string from the end, working backwards, constructing the parse tree.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting string: t83 t69 t2 t26 t76 t79 t13 t24 t70.\n\nWe can represent it as a list: [\"t83\", \"t69\", \"t2\", \"t26\", \"t76\", \"t79\", \"t13\", \"t24\", \"t70\"]\n\nWe need to find a parse from S, which is NT0 NT4, so we can look for pairs that can produce these sequences.\n\nEach symbol in the string must be matched by direct production of a terminal, so perhaps each token is a direct production.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, most symbols are non-terminals that can produce other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nBut to make it manageable, perhaps let me first see which non-terminals directly produce which terminals.\n\nLooking through the end rules:\n\nEach line that ends with '\u2192' a terminal is:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT6 \u2192 t83\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- NT4 \u2192 t32\n- NT7 \u2192 t43\n- NT4 \u2192 t8\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t27\n- NT0 \u2192 t43\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT8 \u2192 t21\n- NT4 \u2192 t84\n- NT7 \u2192 t33\n- NT8 \u2192 t81\n- NT0 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\n- NT4 \u2192 t27\n- NT0 \u2192 t62\n- NT2 \u2192 t26\n- NT3 \u2192 t24\n- NT9 \u2192 t44\n- NT5 \u2192 t15\n- NT7 \u2192 t33\n- NT8 \u2192 t64\n- NT6 \u2192 t77\n- NT6 \u2192 t43\n- NT8 \u2192 t56\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT8 \u2192 t73\n- NT7 \u2192 t76\n- NT6 \u2192 t61\n- NT2 \u2192 t53\n- NT3 \u2192 t69\n- NT4 \u2192 t70\n- NT0 \u2192 t12\n- NT9 \u2192 t20\n- NT7 \u2192 t57\n- NT7 \u2192 t7\n- NT8 \u2192 t57\n- NT2 \u2192 t63\n- NT9 \u2192 t79\n- NT8 \u2192 t53\n- NT8 \u2192 t22\n- NT6 \u2192 t8\n- NT0 \u2192 t80\n- NT4 \u2192 t51\n- NT4 \u2192 t13\n- NT5 \u2192 t62\n- NT3 \u2192 t8\n- NT7 \u2192 t17\n- NT4 \u2192 t28\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT3 \u2192 t39\n- NT3 \u2192 t10\n- NT0 \u2192 t52\n- NT7 \u2192 t70\n- NT6 \u2192 t11\n- NT0 \u2192 t35\n- NT6 \u2192 t67\n- NT8 \u2192 t77\n- NT4 \u2192 t42\n\nWait, each line starting"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-164","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t53 t56 t20 t76 t67 t40 t26 t83 t69`, and the grammar is a big one with a bunch of production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what CNF entails. CNF requires that every production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All rules must have at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. Looking at the grammar provided, it seems to fit this structure since all rules either produce two non-terminals or a single terminal. So that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t53 t56 t20 t76 t67 t40 t26 t83 t69`. The terminals here are these combinations like t53, t56, etc. I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given productions.\n\nThe grammar's start symbol is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, starting from S, I need to see if I can generate these terminals through some series of productions.\n\nTo approach this, I might use a method similar to the pumping lemma or perhaps construct a parse tree manually, but given that manually expanding a string that long is impractical, perhaps I should look for a systematic way to check if each terminal could appear in some leftmost derivation.\n\nBut before diving into that, maybe I should map out the possible sequences each non-terminal can produce. That way, I can see if the given string can result from a combination of these.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal (like NT0, NT2, etc.) has productions that can lead to other non-terminals and eventually terminals. The approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be reached through some path from the start symbol.\n\nHowever, the number of non-terminals here is very high, and the dependencies are complex. This could get quite tangled. Maybe I can look for the order of production steps that can lead to the terminals in the given string.\n\nAnother approach is to use the given string and work backward from the terminals, seeing if we can find a path back to the start symbol. This method is called a backward chaining approach, where you start from the string and try to reduce it step by step using the inverse of the productions.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's list the terminals in order: t53, t56, t20, t76, t67, t40, t26, t83, t69.\n\nStarting with the last terminal, t69. Looking through the grammar to find a production rule that leads to t69.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7, but wait, no, I need to find a non-terminal that directly produces t69. Scanning the productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't69' (since 't69' is a terminal, so the rule is NT3 \u2192 't69'). So the last terminal in the string, t69, must come from NT3.\n\nSo, the derivation chain ends with NT3 \u2192 t69. Therefore, before that, we must have a production that leads to NT3. Looking into the grammar, NT3 has multiple productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't53' (but that's terminal, so not relevant here),\nNT3 \u2192 't72' (another terminal),\nNT3 \u2192 't54' (terminal),\nWait, no. Actually, in the given grammar, NT3 has several productions, some leading to terminals and others to non-terminals.\n\nWait, let me check the given grammar rules again.\n\nLooking into the NT3 rules, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't53' (which would produce t53 directly),\nNT3 \u2192 't72' (t72),\nNT3 \u2192 't54' (t54),\nNT3 \u2192 't43' (t43),\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT6,\nNT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3,\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9,\nand so on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, I might be misreading this.\n\nWait, the way the grammar is presented, each line is a production for a non-terminal. For example:\n\nNT3 -> 't53'\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\n\nNT3 -> 't54'\n\nNT3 -> 't43'\n\nBut looking again, the initial part of the grammar shows S -> NT0 NT4. Then, under NT7, we have NT7 -> NT0 NT2. I think I can parse this as a list of productions for each non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the given grammar is very extensive with multiple productions for each non-terminal, so perhaps I need to list out each rule more clearly.\n\nBut perhaps for brevity, the user has included all the productions, so I need to figure out if I can chain productions to reach each terminal in the string.\n\nAlternatively, given time constraints, maybe it's easier to look for each terminal and see if it can be derived from some sequence.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider that each production in the grammar is of the form X \u2192 aY or X \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, and Y is a non-terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production consists of either terminals or non-terminals on the right.\n\nWait, actually, in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. But looking at the given grammar, for example, NT3 \u2192 't72' is acceptable because that\u2019s a single terminal. However, terms like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 are also acceptable because they produce two non-terminals.\n\nSo each non-terminal can generate either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nNow, given that, the production rules can be used recursively. So, to get a terminal, the non-terminal must directly produce it, or it must produce non-terminals that can derive down to it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to construct a derivation sequence.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first step is to expand S into two non-terminals: NT0 and NT4.\n\nEach of these will need to be expanded further, and so on until we get down to terminals.\n\nThe string given is t53 t56 t20 t76 t67 t40 t26 t83 t69. So that's nine terminals, which means the derivation must involve nine production steps where non-terminals resolve to terminals, or through chains where multiple non-terminals resolve down.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I can create a parse tree in reverse. Starting from the terminals in reverse order, trying to find which non-terminals can produce them, then working back to S.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the last terminal: t69.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't69' (NT3 -> 't69'), so that means that just before the last character, we had NT3 which produced t69. So in the parse tree, t69 comes from NT3.\n\nSo the last step is NT3 -> t69. Now, what produced NT3? Looking back, in the grammar, NT3 has multiple rules. The relevant rules that could produce NT3 would be other non-terminals that have NT3 in their right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT9. So if NT5 is a parent, it could produce NT3 and NT9. But wait, I need to find out where NT3 is derived from.\n\nBut let's see: For the string to end with t69, the derivation up to that point must be ... NT3 -> t69. So just before that, the parse tree has NT3. So to find what came before NT3, we need to see what non-terminals can produce NT3.\n\nLooking into the grammar, I see NT3 can be produced by:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't53' (a terminal),\nNT3 \u2192 't72' (another terminal),\nNT3 \u2192 't54' (another terminal),\nNT3 \u2192 't43' (another terminal),\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9,\nAlso, looking at the rules, there's NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3, NT5 NT9, etc.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should list all the productions for NT3.\n\nFrom the given grammar, searching for NT3, I find:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9\nNT3 -> NT4 NT3\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9\nWait, actually, in the user's provided grammar, under NT3, there are multiple rules.

{"custom_id":"request-181","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string to evaluate is `t33 t60 t73 t52 t12 t23 t76 t74 t44 t24`. \n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar a bit. Context-free grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side is a sequence of terminals and non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that each production starts with a non-terminal (like S, NT0, NT1, etc.) and is split into two parts. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Each NT symbol is a non-terminal that eventually breaks down into sequences of other NTs and terminals.\n\nMy task is to see if the given string can be generated by starting from S and applying these productions through some sequence of steps.\n\nThe string given is `t33 t60 t73 t52 t12 t23 t76 t74 t44 t24`. These look like terminal symbols, each presumably a token. In context-free grammars, each production's right-hand side contributes to the string by substituting non-terminals with sequences of terminals and non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nI think the best approach is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string step by step. However, without knowing the structure, I might need to look for production paths that lead to the terminals in the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, it goes to NT0 NT4. So to produce the string starting with t33, let me see where NT0 and NT4 go.\n\nNT0 has a production like NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. NT9 goes to 't43' and NT7 goes to 't13'. So if I follow NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, I get 't43 t13' from NT0. But the string starts with t33, which isn't matching. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, NT0 could have other productions. Let me check. NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 is another production. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, and then NT9 \u2192 't43', NT8 \u2192 't5'. So NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT8 NT7 \u2192 't43 t5 t13'. That gives 't43 t5 t13', which is a triplet, but our string starts with t33.\n\nAlternatively, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, which is 't43 t13'. But the string starts with t33, which isn't in either case. So maybe NT0 is not the right path.\n\nWait, could there be a different path from NT0? Let me check all productions for NT0. The grammar for NT0 is listed as several rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT6\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT7 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT3\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nWait, I think I may have a mistake there. Maybe not, the list seems long.\n\nThe key is to find a path for each production that can lead to the given terminals. Since the given string starts with 't33', I need to find a production in the grammar that starts with NT leading to 't33'. Let me search the productions for a non-terminal that directly produces 't33'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37' (from NT4 \u2192 't37')\nNT7 \u2192 't13'\nNT5 \u2192 't27'\nNT6 \u2192 't83'\nNT8 \u2192 't5' (twice)\nNT0 \u2192 't23' (twice)\nNT3 \u2192 't72' etc.\n\nWait, none of the non-terminals directly produce 't33'. Then perhaps 't33' is a derived symbol, meaning it must come from a sequence of derivations leading up to it. So, I need to see if 't33' can be part of the derived string through some combination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string contains multiple non-terminals that combine to form tokens. Let me check the string: `t33 t60 t73 t52 t12 t23 t76 t74 t44 t24`.\n\nEach of these is a separate terminal symbol. So the derivation must split into these steps.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the string into individual tokens. Since each production is a split of the string into parts, perhaps we can build the string as a series of split rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't33'. None of the non-terminals directly produce 't33'. So perhaps 't33' is a composite of several steps. Let's look for productions where a non-terminal can split into 't33' or parts of it.\n\nLooking for production NT6 \u2192 't83', but 't83' isn't 't33'. Wait, NT0 \u2192 't23' directly, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first step is to derive S as NT0 NT4. Then each of these can split into their own rules.\n\nFrom the string, perhaps the first part is 't33', which might come from NT0. But earlier, NT0 didn't produce 't33', so maybe it's part of a more complex derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is built through a series of such derivations, and each 't' comes from a specific production.\n\nWait, another approach: each terminal symbol is assigned a specific production. So for example, 't33' is produced by a specific non-terminal. I need to trace where 't33' comes from.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see that 't33' is not directly produced by any non-terminal. Therefore, it must come from a non-terminal that combines into 't33' through other rules.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to find a chain of productions that ultimately result in 't33'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT0, which can produce 't23', but that's not 't33'. Maybe via other routes. Alternatively, maybe 't33' comes from NT3 \u2192 't72', but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token 't33' is from NT0, but looking at the grammar for NT0, the rules that produce 't' symbols are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' (twice)\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- etc.\n\nNone of these have 't33'. So perhaps 't33' comes from a sequence of non-terminals that somehow combine to produce 't33'.\n\nLooking at NT3 \u2192 't72' etc., perhaps that's a dead end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built through multiple concatenations of split rules. For example, the first part 't33' could come from a non-terminal that splits into two parts, then each of those could split further until you get to 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the rightmost or leftmost derivations.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire string: `t33 t60 t73 t52 t12 t23 t76 t74 t44 t24`.\n\nThis is a sequence of ten tokens. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, each token must be a direct or indirect production from a non-terminal, with possible splitting.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S splits into NT0 and NT4.\n\nEach of these must then split further. Let's suppose the first part is 't33', which must come from NT0, as S is NT0 NT4.\n\nBut earlier, NT0 doesn't directly produce 't33'; none of the NT0 productions give 't33' as a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps 't33' comes from a non-terminal derived from NT0 through multiple steps.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, for example, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 \u2192 't43 t13', but that's 't43 t13' which is not 't33'.\n\nAlternatively, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 \u2192 NT9 NT8 NT7 \u2192 't43 t5 t13' which gives 't43 t5 t13', which is three tokens, not helpful for the first token.\n\nIs there any way NT0 can derive 't33'?\n\nLooking at NT0, it has a production to NT3 NT5: NT0"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-189","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string `t7 t23 t3 t20 t21 t81 t81 t67 t54 t40` is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This should make parsing manageable, perhaps using something like the CYK algorithm, but since the string is linear, maybe a stack-based approach could work.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals: t7, t23, t20, t21, t81, t81, t67, t54, t40. Each of these corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. My approach is to model the possible derivations starting from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting from S, which expands to NT0 NT4 (since S \u2192 NT0 NT4). So, the first two symbols t7 and t23 must correspond to derivations of NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nLet me list the production rules for NT4. Looking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions, including NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and a few others. But primarily, it looks like NT4 will derive sequences involving NT3, NT5, and NT6. \n\nSimilarly, NT0 has multiple productions. Looking at the NT0 rules, it seems NT0 uses NT6 and NT7, which in turn use other non-terminals. \n\nI need to check if the given string can be matched by these rules. \n\nLooking at the first two terms, t7 and t23. \n\n- t7 corresponds to NT7 \u2192 t7 when NT7 is at a terminal. Let me confirm if NT7 can be a terminal. Yes, looking at the grammar, there is a rule NT7 \u2192 't7', so that works. But t23 is supposed to be the output of NT0.\n\nWhat's NT0's terminal? Looking at the grammar, NT0 has a production that leads to t23, so NT0 \u2192 't23'. So, t7 comes from NT7, which is derived from NT7 \u2192 't7', and t23 comes from NT0 \u2192 't23'. \n\nSo the first two terms are fine.\n\nNext, the third term is t20. This should come from the next non-terminal after NT0, but wait, how does the parse go? After NT0, which is 't23', the next non-terminal is NT4, which should produce the next sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the structure more carefully. \n\nLet me think about the parsing process. Since it's a leftmost derivation, the parser starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which suggests that the first symbol must come from NT0, followed by NT4.\n\nBut wait, NT0 is 't23', so the first symbol is t23. Then, NT4 should start, and the next symbols should be the expansion of NT4.\n\nWait, maybe I got the order wrong. S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first part is NT0, then NT4. But in the string, the first symbol is t7, which would be NT7, which I thought came from NT7 \u2192 't7'. But that's the issue: the first symbol is t7, which would mean that S's first NT0 is producing t7. But actually, the initial S starts with NT0, which is part of the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first NT0 is 't23', then NT4.\n\nBut this doesn't match the string \"t7 t23...\". So perhaps I got the order wrong. Wait, no\u2014S expands to NT0 followed by NT4. So in the parsed string, the initial part is NT0, then NT4. \n\nBut the string starts with t7. So that can't be, because S begins with NT0. Unless T7 is part of the NT0 derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to model the entire expansion step by step.\n\nLet me start by setting up the stack with S, and then apply productions step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals can produce them and in which order.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to look for possible expansions that lead to the given string. Let's try to parse the string step by step, trying to match each token.\n\nThe string is: t7, t23, t20, t21, t81, t81, t67, t54, t40.\n\n1. The first element is t7. Let's see what can produce t7. Looking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't7' is a terminal production. So NT7 can produce t7. So the first step must be to have NT7 be t7, and then where does it come from?\n\nWait, but the initial S is NT0 followed by NT4. So how would NT7 get involved?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I need to re-express the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is being parsed as a sequence of NT0 and NT4, but in the given string, the first token is t7, which is the terminal from NT7. But the initial S expansion is NT0 NT4, which would be the first two parts. This seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me list the grammar productions from each non-terminal:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo the first symbol must come from NT0, which must then be able to produce t23. Wait, but t7 is the first symbol in the string, which can't be produced by NT0 as NT0 can only produce terminals like 't23'.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me check the production rules for the non-terminals that produce 'tX' terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT7 \u2192 't7' is one rule. NT0 \u2192 't23' is another. Similarly, NT3 has several rules leading to different t's, like t31, t24, etc. So in the string, the first symbol is t7, which would come from NT7, and the next is t23 from NT0.\n\nBut wait, S starts with NT0. So in the string, the first symbol must be from NT0. But the string starts with t7, which is a terminal. So this suggests that either:\n\n1. The initial parsing is incorrect, or\n2. There's a way for NT0 to produce t7 through some expansion.\n\nLooking at NT0's production rules:\n\nNT0 can produce:\n\n- NT6 NT7\n- NT9 NT7\n- NT9 NT6\n- NT5 NT5\n- etc.\n\nNone of these directly produce t7. Wait, but NT7 can produce t7, so maybe in an expansion of NT0, we have a chain that eventually leads to NT7, which then becomes 't7'.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, let's see if any production can lead to NT7, which then can produce t7.\n\nFor example, one rule is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. So NT0 can produce NT9 followed by NT7. Then, NT9 can produce t7 if there's a rule for that. Looking back, yes, NT9 \u2192 't7' is a production. Wait, no, looking again, the rules for NT9 are:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't43', 't56', 't64', etc. I don't see NT9 directly producing t7. Wait, checking the provided rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT9 appears on the RHS of NT0 \u2192 't23', but to produce t7, I need to see if any NT9 or NT7 can produce 't7'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLooking for NT7: It has ND7 \u2192 't7', 't13', etc. So NT7 can produce 't7' directly. But where does NT0 expand into NT7?\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nYes, that's one production. So perhaps in NT0, a production leads to NT6 followed by NT7. Then, NT7 can directly produce 't7'.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nThen, NT6 can produce further, and NT7 produces 't7'.\n\nBut where does NT6 come into play? Let's see NT6's production:\n\nNT6 can expand to multiple non-terminals, including NT0. So perhaps NT6 can go through several steps to reach the required terminal.\n\nSo, let me try to model this as a leftmost derivation.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt7, t23, t20, t21, t81, t81, t67, t54, t40.\n\nBut wait, that's nine symbols.

Hmm, first, I remember that context-free grammars are used to generate languages, and they have production rules that can be recursive, which might make parsing tricky.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So all the symbols on the right side are either two non-terminals or two terminals, except maybe the start symbol. Let me check the start symbol S. The first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S expands into two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, I need to see if the given string can be derived from S. The string is \"t53 t79 t72 t26 t31 t64 t60 t12 t47 t8 t79\". Wait, but I should note that the string seems to have spaces, but in the grammar, the productions are into terminals and non-terminals, so perhaps the string should be treated as a sequence of terminal symbols without spaces. Maybe the spaces were just for readability. So I'll consider the string as \"t53 t79 t72 t26 t31 t64 t60 t12 t47 t8 t79\" as t53, t79, etc., but I need to check if each token is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the terminals start with 't' followed by numbers. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc. So the string consists of terminal symbols.\n\nNow, the approach is probably to use a top-down parsing method since we're working with a context-free grammar. But given the complexity, it might be easier to write out the derivation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the string can be broken down into parts that fit into the productions.\n\nBut wait, given that the productions are extensive, maybe I can find a pattern or see if the string can be constructed through a series of left or right derivations.\n\nAnother approach is to look for each token in the string and check if it can be derived from the start symbol. For example, each 't' something must be a terminal that is a production rule in the grammar.\n\nLooking at each token:\n\n- t53: Let's see which rule produces 't53'. In the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 t72 elsewhere, but can any NT produce t53? Let me scan the rules. Oh, NT3 has a rule NT3 \u2192 t72, but not t53. Wait, I see other rules like NT3 \u2192 t53? Or maybe elsewhere. Wait, in the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't53'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't53' is present? I think I see a few rules like NT0 -> 't03' or something else. Wait, looking carefully: Yes, here's a rule: NT3 -> 't53' is present. So yes, t53 is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, t79: Let's see if any NT rules produce 't79'. Looking through the rules: I see NT9 \u2192 't79' (in one rule). So t79 must come from NT9.\n\nt72: Check the rule. Yes, NT3 \u2192 't72'.\n\nt26: Let's see. Looking at the rules: NT2 \u2192 't26'.\n\nt31: I need to check which NT rule produces 't31'. Looking through the rules, I see NT9 \u2192 't31' is a production. So yes.\n\nt64: Looking for a rule: NT6 \u2192 't64'.\n\nt60: Does any NT produce 't60'? Checking the rules, yes, NT8 \u2192 't60'.\n\nt12: Looking for a production. NT4 \u2192 't12'.\n\nt47: Which NT produces 't47'? Checking the rules, NT4 \u2192 't47' is a production.\n\nt8: Let's see: Looking through the productions, NT0 \u2192 't8' is present.\n\nt79 again: As before, from NT9.\n\nSo, all the tokens correspond to terminal symbols, so the string is composed of terminals, so it's possible that they can be derived.\n\nNow, the next step is to see if the entire string can result from a left-recursive or right-recursive derivation starting from S.\n\nBut that might be quite involved. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find a parse tree that constructs the string step by step.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of symbols in the string: there are 11 tokens. Each production in the grammar is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, to derive a string of 11 symbols, the number of productions used would be 10, since each production adds one symbol, except for non-terminals which can expand into more.\n\nWait, no. Each production rule for a non-terminal can produce two symbols, but each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one (since one non-terminal is replaced by two). So starting from S, the first step would replace S with two non-terminals, so two symbols. Then, each non-terminal can be expanded, and so on.\n\nWait, actually, each production in CNF adds one token. So a string of length n will require n-1 productions. But since S starts as one symbol (when considering non-terminals), but in our case, since S produces two non-terminals, so the process is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of productions would correspond to the length of the string minus one, but each step can expand multiple non-terminals.\n\nThis approach might not be efficient. Perhaps another angle is to consider each token and try to build a parse tree.\n\nLet me list the tokens again in order:\n\n1. t53 (NT3)\n2. t79 (NT9)\n3. t72 (NT3)\n4. t26 (NT2)\n5. t31 (NT9)\n6. t64 (NT6)\n7. t60 (NT8)\n8. t12 (NT4)\n9. t47 (NT4)\n10. t8 (NT0)\n11. t79 (NT9)\n\nSo the string is: [t53, t79, t72, t26, t31, t64, t60, t12, t47, t8, t79]\n\nNow, let's try to break this down. Starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4 (which is production 1). So S expands to NT0 and NT4. The string then starts with t53 (NT3) t79 (NT9)... Wait, but the first two symbols are t53 and t79, which are from NT3 and NT9. But according to production 1, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which are different NT0 and NT4, not NT3 and NT9.\n\nHmm, maybe that suggests that the initial split doesn't make sense, and perhaps the first step would be to expand NT0 and NT4 into something else.\n\nLet's consider if NT0 can produce something that starts with t53. Looking at NT0's productions, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (line 4)\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (line 7)\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (line 14)\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6 (line 18)\nWait, actually, reviewing the rules for NT0: the available rules are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT9 (line 18)\nI'm not seeing a direct production of 't53' from NT0, but from NT3, we have t53 as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, for NT4: looking at its productions, I see NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6 (line 3), NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2 (line 4), etc. So no direct 't53' from NT4, but NT3's production gives 't53'.\n\nThis suggests that the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which would then need to be expanded into sequences of non-terminals that can then produce the tokens in the string.\n\nGiven that, let's attempt to derive the string step by step.\n\nLet's start with S: Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo the string is: [t53, t79, t72, t26, t31, t64, t60, t12, t47, t8, t79]\n\nAssuming that the first symbols t53 and t79 come from NT3 and NT9, but that's not how S's expansion via NT0 and NT4 works. So perhaps the initial step needs to be an expansion of NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbols of the string, t53 and"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, especially with Chomsky normal form. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, the grammar is quite extensive. It has a bunch of non-terminals (S, NT0, NT1, etc.) that produce other non-terminals and terminals (which are the 't' followed by numbers). The top-level production is S -> NT0 NT4, so any valid string must be a combination of derivations starting from S.\n\nThe string we're checking is a sequence of terminals (like 't31', 't42', etc.) separated by spaces. So the string is \"t31 t42 t43 t27 t31 t57 t54 t14 t67 t7 t73\".\n\nWait, actually, in the problem description, the string is written as \"t31 t42 t43 t27 t31 t57 t54 t14 t67 t7 t73\", which is a series of tokens. Since this is a context-free grammar, I think each token corresponds to a terminal symbol. So each 'tX' is a terminal.\n\nTo check if this string is in the language, I need to see if there's a derivation from S that results in exactly this string, in order.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nI should start by trying to match the string from the top, starting with the start symbol S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nSo the string starts with t31. Let me check what NT0 and NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT0: there are multiple productions, like NT0 -> NT9 NT7, NT0 -> NT9 NT7 again, NT0 -> NT2 NT9, etc. Also, NT0 appears in some productions like NT7 -> NT4 NT0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has multiple productions, including NT4 -> NT8 NT6, NT4 -> NT4 NT3, etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t31. Looking at the grammar's productions for NT0 and NT4, I need to find if any of their productions can start with t31.\n\nLooking at the NTx productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't72', so that's a terminal.\n\nNT5 -> 't3', which is also a terminal.\n\nNT7 -> 't13', etc.\n\nSo I think the approach is to try to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, perhaps we can parse the string using a CYK algorithm or some other method, but since the string is relatively short, maybe we can manually check.\n\nAnother approach is to see which non-terminals can directly produce a token. For example, NT3 can produce 't72', which is part of the string. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't13', etc.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t31. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t31.\n\nLooking at all the NT productions, I don't see any that directly produce t31. That's a problem. Because in the grammar, each production is either a two-step non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back, I might have missed it. Let me check each NT's productions:\n\nNT3 has 't72', 't73', 't31', 't53', etc. Let me confirm. Yes, looking at the grammar, there are several NT3 productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\n\nNT3 -> 't73'\n\nNT3 -> 't31'\n\nNT3 -> 't31' again\n\nAnd others like NT3 -> 't53', etc.\n\nSo NT3 can produce t31. Similarly, NT7 can produce 't13', and NT8 can produce 't5', and so on.\n\nTherefore, the string begins with t31, which can be produced directly by NT3. So perhaps the derivation starts with S -> NT0 NT4, leading to parts that produce the string's beginning.\n\nWait, but S -> NT0 NT4, so the first symbol is from NT0, the second from NT4. But the string starts with t31, which is from NT3. That might be an issue unless one of the non-terminals in NT0 or NT4 can produce t31 or if the string is constructed in a way that allows that.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Since the grammar is given and the string has a certain structure, perhaps I can try to parse it step by step.\n\nLet me consider the entire string: t31 t42 t43 t27 t31 t57 t54 t14 t67 t7 t73.\n\nI can split this into individual tokens: [t31, t42, t43, t27, t31, t57, t54, t14, t67, t7, t73].\n\nWe need to check if this sequence can be generated by the grammar starting from S.\n\nGiven S -> NT0 NT4, the string must be a concatenation of two parts: one derived from NT0 and another from NT4.\n\nSo, the string should be s = A B, where A is derived from NT0 and B is derived from NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t31. Let's assume this comes from NT0. So A must produce t31... up to some point, and B must produce the remaining tokens.\n\nWait, but the start is S -> NT0 NT4, so the string starts with NT0, followed by NT4. So the tokens should be t01 t02 t03 ... t41 t42 ... etc.\n\nLooking at the given string: it starts with t31, which would be within NT0's production. So let's see what NT0 can produce.\n\nNT0 has several productions. One of them is NT0 -> NT6 NT7. Another is NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc. So, perhaps the derivation starts with NT0 -> NT6 NT7, and then NT6 and NT7 produce some tokens.\n\nBut without knowing the exact sequence, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps each of the tokens in the string is produced by a non-terminal, and we can try to parse the string by breaking it into a series of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to list all the possible NTs that can produce each token in the string.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each token corresponds to a non-terminal that can directly produce it, and then see if the sequence of non-terminals can be derived from S.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to look for a valid deduction. Let's try to see if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t31 t42 t43 t27 t31 t57 t54 t14 t67 t7 t73.\n\nLet me see if I can group these into parts that match the grammar.\n\nGiven that S produces NT0 followed by NT4, perhaps the string can be split into two parts: left part from NT0 and right part from NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be constructed by a series of steps where each non-terminal expands into two other non-terminals, until we get to terminals.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Maybe I can try to see if each token can be produced by some non-terminal, and then see if the structure makes sense.\n\nLet's list each token and see what NT can produce it:\n\n- t31: NT3 can produce t31 (as per the grammar).\n- t42: Looking for NT that produces t42. Checking all NTs, I don't see any production for t42. Wait, let me check the grammar again. I don't see any NT directly producing 't42'. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I missed it. Let me look through all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through all the NTx entries, I don't see any production that directly yields 't42'. Hmm, that could be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the string is constructed. Maybe it's a question of whether the tokens can be derived as a sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is built by replacing the non-terminals step by step, and each replacement breaks down the tokens into other non-terminals and terminals. So, for example, each time a NT is expanded, it's replaced with two symbols.\n\nBut without seeing an actual derivation, it's hard to reconstruct. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nSince the string has 11 tokens, and each step in Chomsky normal form replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the derivation length would be 2n-1 for a string of n tokens. But that's more about the structure than the specific tokens.\n\nAlternatively,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-228","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form, which I think means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. The string to evaluate is \"t14 t10 t72 t69 t79 t23 t67 t20 t21 t13 t73 t22\". \n\nFirst, I should probably look at the grammar rules and see how they can derive this string. Let me start by breaking down the string into tokens: t14, t10, t72, t69, t79, t23, t67, t20, t21, t13, t73, t22. So there are 12 tokens.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that several rules end in t's with numbers, which likely correspond to terminals in the grammar. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23', so each of these t's probably comes from some transformation of the non-terminals.\n\nI'll try to map each token to its corresponding non-terminal. \n\nt14: Looking at the rules, NT4 \u2192 't83', but that's not helpful. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT4 -> 't37' and 't5', among others. Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should work backwards. Each non-terminal is broken down into other non-terminals until I can get to the terminal tokens. Let's take the first token, t14. Let's see which rules produce t14. Looking through the list, I see NT4 \u2192 't83', but t83 isn't in the string. Wait, maybe I need to look for which non-terminals have t14 in their productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any rule where a non-terminal directly produces 't14' immediately, except perhaps through a chain of productions. Maybe I should try to see how 't14' is derived.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be parsed by the grammar step by step. Let me think about possible ways the string could have been formed.\n\nAnother approach: Each step in the grammar produces two symbols. The string has 12 tokens, so the derivation would have gone through 11 steps. The start symbol is S, which is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols after S would be NT0 and NT4. So the initial expansion is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, but the string starts with t14, which is the first terminal. So the first token should come from NT0 or NT4, but given the order, the first symbol would be NT0, so t14 comes from NT0's derivation.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, I see that NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and earlier NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Wait, and NT0 can also directly produce 't23', as in one of the rules: NT0 \u2192 't23'. But in the string, the first token is t14, not t23. So perhaps t14 isn't directly from NT0. That suggests I might have made a mistake. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at all the rules that directly produce a terminal and see if any of them produce t14. Looking through the list, I see NT4 \u2192 't37', 't5', 't27', 't57', etc. But I don't see any rule that directly produces t14. Similarly, other non-terminals like NT2 might produce t10. Let me check NT2's rules: NT2 \u2192 't7', 't26', etc. So 't10' is a t72's part? No, perhaps looking deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token comes from NT0 or NT4. Let's see the rules again.\n\nLooking back, the first rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the initial expansion is NT0 and NT4. The first token is t14, which might come from NT4 if one of NT4's rules produces t14. But in the grammar rules, I see NT4 has several rules, but none directly produce 't14'. All look like they produce combinations of NTx and other symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to trace how each token is generated by the grammar. Let me see if 't14' can be derived from any of the non-terminals. Looking at the list, I don't see a direct production for 't14' except perhaps through a chain. For example, maybe NT4 can lead to 't14' via some combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long and the grammar doesn't allow this combination. I think a better approach is to see if the structure of the string matches the possible derivations from S.\n\nThe string has 12 tokens, so the derivation would be S \u2192 NT0 NT4 (expanding to two symbols each time). Let me try to build the string step by step.\n\n1. Start: S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n2. NT0 may expand into more symbols, and NT4 may as well.\n3. The first token is t14, so if NT0 expands to produce t14, that would be ideal. But I don't see a direct rule. So maybe NT4 must produce the first token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the order. Let me see: the first symbol is t14, which would come from NT4, for example. But I don't see any rule where NT4 directly produces t14. All of NT4's rules produce pairs like NTx and other NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each token must be produced by a non-terminal that eventually expands into a terminal. Let me consider each token and find their possible paths.\n\nt14: I need to find which non-terminal can produce t14 through a series of rules. Looking through the grammar, I don't see any non-terminal with a production directly to t14. So maybe t14 is produced by a chain of non-terminals. For example, maybe NT4 \u2192 ... \u2192 a series of rules that eventually produce t14.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the structure is more complicated. Maybe the string is a concatenation of the results of NT0 and NT4, each of which is a sequence of non-terminals that eventually produce their respective terminals.\n\nFor example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would produce a string that is the concatenation of NT0's expansion and NT4's expansion.\n\nSo the provided string has 12 tokens, presumably the expansion of NT0 and NT4 each contributing some number of tokens.\n\nWait, let me count: the provided string is t14 t10 t72 t69 t79 t23 t67 t20 t21 t13 t73 t22. That's 12 tokens. So if S \u2192 NT0 NT4, each NT0 and NT4 must contribute 6 or 5 tokens. Let me check:\n\nLet me consider NT0: what could it expand into? Looking through the rules, NT0 can expand into NT9 NT7, NT6 NT7, etc. Maybe let me try to find a possible expansion path for NT0 that results in 6 tokens.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can expand into other symbols and maybe lead to the remaining 6 tokens.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to see that each non-terminal always expands into two non-terminals, so the number of tokens doubles each step until terminals are reached. But in the provided string, we have 12 tokens, which is 2^3.5, which isn't a power of two. However, perhaps the initial steps go to more non-terminals, and then some branches turn into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the grammar can produce any string where the non-terminals expand through pairs, perhaps the parity of the number of symbols is always an issue. The starting symbol S produces two non-terminals, so after each step, the number of symbols can increase by adding non-terminals or reduce if non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nWait, each production either keeps the same number of symbols (since it's of the form A\u2192BC, each step replaces one with two) or might terminate if a non-terminal can produce a terminal. So the total number of symbols in the string would follow certain rules. Starting with one symbol (S), then after expansion, two symbols, and so on.\n\nBut in our case, the string has 12 symbols, which is 11 production steps away from S. Let me see if 12 is achievable: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 ... It depends on whether some non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nBut in our case, none of the non-terminals seem to produce a single terminal directly except individual ones, but let me check: Some non-terminals have rules that end with 't-something'. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23', which is a single terminal. Similarly, NT5 \u2192 't15', etc.\n\nWait, no. Looking back, each rule that ends with a 't' is from a specific production.\n\nWait, looking through the rules again:\n\n- Each production that ends with a 't' is just for specific non-terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-224","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF). The grammar provided is quite complex, and the string to check is \"t42 t83 t61 t53 t37 t13 t43 t67 t83 t8 t52 t28\".\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal, and B and C are non-terminals or terminals. This structure is useful because it simplifies parsing and is commonly used in algorithms like the CYK algorithm for context-free languages.\n\nNow, looking at the grammar, I notice that each production alternates between rules with non-terminals on the left and right sides. For example, the start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, NT0 is defined as NT6 NT7, and so on. Each step seems to involve breaking down non-terminals into combinations of other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nThe string to check consists of terminal symbols, each possibly consisting of two letters. To see if the string can be produced by the grammar, I need to find a derivation path that starts from the start symbol S and ends with this string, expanding non-terminals until all are replaced by terminals.\n\nStarting with the entire string, it's a sequence of 12 terminal symbols. Let's count the number of symbols: 12. In CNF, each step of applying a production increases the number of symbols by one because each non-terminal is replaced by two symbols (either two non-terminals or one terminal). Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. So, if you have a string of terminals, you have to see if each part can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, for a string of length n, there must be n-1 productions applied. So for 12 symbols, we'd need 11 productions. But that's a bit abstract.\n\nAnother approach is to model the parse as a tree and see if the string can be obtained by expanding the start symbol S through the productions in the grammar.\n\nGiven the complexity of the grammar, manually tracing each step might be time-consuming. Perhaps I can look for key patterns or terminals that might hint at possible derivations.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many non-terminals produce pairs of other non-terminals, which themselves produce more non-terminals, until we get to the terminals. The terminals are two-character strings like 't42', 't83', etc. Each step is deterministic as per the productions.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that each terminal in the string must appear as a leaf in the parse tree. So, the string is a sequence of such terminals, and each must be reachable from the start symbol via the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to decompose the string step by step, seeing if each part can be mapped to a production.\n\nLet me write down the string: t42, t83, t61, t53, t37, t13, t43, t67, t83, t8, t52, t28.\n\nI need to see if these can be derived from the start symbol S through the given rules.\n\nAnother idea is to check for each terminal whether it's a non-terminal in the grammar. Wait, no, in the grammar, all terminals are the two-character strings, and the rest are non-terminals. So the string is a sequence of these terminals, each of which is either in the grammar as a terminal or as a non-terminal that can produce that terminal.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, the non-terminals are all the symbols starting with 'N' like NT0, NT1, etc. The terminals are the 't' followed by two digits, like t12, t43, etc., and some other two-character strings like t20, t28, etc.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, after some non-terminals, the productions start to produce specific terminal strings, like 't42', 't83', etc. So the grammar's terminals are these specific two-character strings.\n\nSo each of the terminals in the given string must be one of the terminals allowed by the grammar. Let me check if the given string's elements are all present in the grammar's terminal list.\n\nLooking through the grammar's rules, the terminals are things like 't42', 't83', 't61', 't53', 't37', 't13', 't43', 't67', 't83', 't8', 't52', 't28'.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under the non-terminals, some rules produce specific terminals:\n\nFor example:\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT7 -> 't54'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT0 -> 't74'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT7 -> 't43'\nNT4 -> 't8'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT5 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT8 -> 't21'\nNT4 -> 't84'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT8 -> 't84'\nNT8 -> 't81'\nNT0 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT4 -> 't27'\nNT0 -> 't62'\nNT2 -> 't26'\nNT3 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT5 -> 't15'\nNT7 -> 't33'\nNT8 -> 't64'\nNT6 -> 't77'\nNT6 -> 't43'\nNT8 -> 't56'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT8 -> 't73'\nNT7 -> 't76'\nNT6 -> 't61'\nNT2 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't69'\nNT4 -> 't70'\nNT0 -> 't12'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT7 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't7'\nNT8 -> 't57'\nNT2 -> 't63'\nNT9 -> 't79'\nNT8 -> 't53'\nNT8 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't51'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't62'\nNT3 -> 't8'\nNT7 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't52'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT6 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't35'\nNT6 -> 't67'\nNT8 -> 't77'\nNT4 -> 't42'\n\nLooking at these, some two-character terminals are present, like 't83', which is produced by NT8 (look at NT8 -> 't5' and NT8 -> 't84'?

Hmm, but in the given string, 't83' is present, but the grammar doesn't explicitly produce 't83'. Instead, looking back, I see that NT0 -> 't43', NT8 -> 't56' (among others), but 't83' isn't directly produced. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the grammar rules again.

But looking at the given grammar, I notice some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right side.

So the given grammar should still be in CNF.\n\nWait, no, actually, in strict CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right, except for the case when a production becomes a terminal. So the rule S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is fine. Let me check other rules to ensure they're in CNF. For example, NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6 is good. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8 is correct.

The last symbol is 't76'. Looking at the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't13', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc. So 't76' might be from NT4. Checking NT4 \u2192 't47'? Wait, let me look. In the given rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't37' and NT4 \u2192 other productions. Wait, perhaps I need to find where 't76' comes from.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't13', 't43', etc. Wait, checking the grammar, I notice that NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 t72, and NT4 has t32. But wait, looking through, I think I see a rule where NT3 can produce 't76'. Let me check: Yes, there's a rule NT3 \u2192 't76'.

So the last part of the string is a derivation ending with NT3.\n\nNext, before 't76' is 't74', so the last two symbols are t74 and t76.

So we need to see if any production directly produces t39.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\nI see NT3 \u2192 't72', 't69', 't31', 't33', etc. For example, in the rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't31', and in other rules, NT9 \u2192 't24', etc. Also, looking through, I notice that NT3 has a rule NT3 \u2192 't76'.

Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe 't39' is part of a non-terminal sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps 't39' is the result of a non-terminal. Let's check if any non-terminal can generate 't39'.\n\nLooking through the rules for each non-terminal:\n\nNT0: 't23', 't28', etc.\nNT1: I don't see any in the given rules.\nNT2: 't7', 't53', etc.\nNT3: 't24', 't31', 't33', 't39', etc. Wait, yes!

Now, the remaining string is t81 t79 t14 t10 t67 t79 t64 t2 t83 t42 t74 t76.\n\nNext, we need to match this remaining string, which starts with t81. So we need the next non-terminal to produce t81.\n\nSo now, the leftmost symbol is t81, which must be produced by a non-terminal. Let's see which non-terminals produce t81.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't51', 't57', 't81'. Yes, NT8 can produce 't81'.\n\nSo the next step is NT8 \u2192 't81'. Now, the remaining string is t79 t14 t10 t67 t79 t64 t2 t83 t42 t74 t76.\n\nSo now, after the first two steps, the string to parse is t79 t14 t10 t67 t79 t64 t2 t83 t42 t74 t76, and the next symbol is t79. Let's see which non-terminal can produce t79.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't43', etc. Wait, no, looking at the production rules, I see NT76, but wait, perhaps I should check for NT's that can produce t79.\n\nWait, let me check each non-terminal's productions:\n\nLooking through, for example, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't47', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing it.

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a specific type of context-free grammar where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. So, all the rules in the grammar should follow this structure. Let me check if that's the case here.\n\nLooking through the grammar, all the productions seem to be either two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 fits because both NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals, and nothing else is on the RHS. So, it's in CNF. That makes parsing easier, maybe via something like the CYK algorithm or a recursive descent parser, but not necessary for this particular check.\n\nNow, the string given consists of a series of 't's followed by numbers, like `t14`, which I assume are terminal symbols since they correspond to parts of the derived string. But in CNF, each production step can produce exactly one terminal symbol. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So each step of the derivation adds exactly two non-terminals or a terminal, but the entire string is built up by expanding non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nWait, no, the derivation replaces a single non-terminal with either two non-terminals or a terminal. So the string is built by eliminating all non-terminals, which would result in a sequence of terminal symbols. So the string must match the leftmost derivations of the grammar.\n\nBut to check if the string is generated, I might need to see if there's a leftmost derivation that reduces the start symbol S to this string. Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the grammar's structure to see if the parse tree for this string is possible.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to construct a parse tree for the string step by step, ensuring that each step follows the grammar rules.\n\nLet me look at the string: `t14 t31 t24 t2 t72 t9 t61 t28 t32 t10 t5 t83 t64`. So, it's 13 segments, each starting with 't' and a number. That means it's 13 terminals\u2014so the derivation must have expanded 13 terminal symbols. Since S starts as a single non-terminal, each step will expand non-terminals until we have 13 terminals. Each production in CNF increases the number of symbols by one (since A \u2192 BC adds two symbols for one, but we started with one and must end with 13, which is an odd number of symbols, so total steps would lead to 13 terminals.\n\nWait, but the number of steps to get from 1 non-terminal (S) to 13 terminals: Each application of a rule in CNF either replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals (increasing the count by one) or with a terminal (keeps the count the same). So starting from 1:\n\nWe need to reach 13 terminals. So the number of terminals added must be 12. Since each production can either add one or keep it, but only when replacing a non-terminal with two others, it adds one. So if we have k productions of type A \u2192 BC, the total number of terminals would be 1 + k. So 1 + k = 13 \u2192 k = 12. So the derivation would have 12 steps where A \u2192 BC was used, and others where A \u2192 terminal was used.\n\nBut perhaps that's more than I need to think about. Maybe a better approach is to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to assign each segment to a non-terminal and see if I can reconstruct the tree. Hmm... that's a bit abstract.\n\nLet me see how 't14' is derived. In the grammar, 't14' corresponds to the production NT14 something? Wait, looking at the grammar, there are rules where the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side can have other non-terminals or terminals. Specifically, for example, NT0 \u2192 't23', which I guess is a rule that replaces NT0 with t23. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't77' etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, some productions are like S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, each NTx is either a non-terminal or a terminal. For example, looking at the grammar:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT8 \u2192 't21'\n- NT4 \u2192 't84'\n- NT7 \u2192 't33'\n- NT4 \u2192 't9'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT2 \u2192 't26'\n- NT3 \u2192 't24'\n- NT9 \u2192 't44'\n- NT5 \u2192 't15'\n- NT7 \u2192 't33'\n- NT8 \u2192 't64'\n- NT6 \u2192 't77'\n- NT6 \u2192 't43'\n- NT8 \u2192 't56'\n- NT3 \u2192 't2'\n- NT8 \u2192 't73'\n- NT7 \u2192 't76'\n- NT6 \u2192 't61'\n- NT2 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't69'\n- NT4 \u2192 't70'\n- NT0 \u2192 't12'\n- NT9 \u2192 't20'\n- NT7 \u2192 't57'\n- NT4 \u2192 't51'\n- NT5 \u2192 't62'\n- NT3 \u2192 't8'\n- NT7 \u2192 't17'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT0 \u2192 't80'\n- NT3 \u2192 't39'\n- NT3 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't52'\n- NT7 \u2192 't70'\n- NT6 \u2192 't11'\n- NT0 \u2192 't35'\n- NT6 \u2192 't67'\n- NT8 \u2192 't77'\n- NT4 \u2192 't42'\n\nSo, the terminal symbols are those that have an arrow to a single terminal. For example, NT2 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal. Another example is NT5 \u2192 't15', and so on.\n\nSo, to parse the string `t14 t31 t24 t2 t72 t9 t61 t28 t32 t10 t5 t83 t64`, we can note the 't's followed by numbers and see which non-terminals they come from.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to see if the structure can be built from the grammar. Maybe I can look for the rules that produce each terminal step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a left-most derivation tree.\n\nLet me try to see the structure. Since the string is `t14 t31 t24 t2 t72 t9 t61 t28 t32 t10 t5 t83 t64`, there are 13 terminals.\n\nBut wait, in the grammar, some non-terminals are expanded into terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-263","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on my grammar rules, but let's try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has a specific structure where each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to terminals. But looking at the grammar provided, I see rules like S -> NT0 NT4, which is fine. However, there are some rules where the right-hand side has three non-terminals, like NT4 -> NT4 NT3. Wait, that doesn't fit CNF because CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me double-check. Yes, in the given grammar, some rules have two non-terminals, like NT7 -> NT0 NT2 is correct, but others have three or even more, like NT4 -> NT4 NT3. That might mean the grammar isn't actually in CNF, but the user has specified that it is, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the terminals are also considered as non-terminals or it's a mix. Alternatively, perhaps the grammar is structured differently, but I'm not entirely sure. However, the problem says it is in CNF, so I should proceed with that assumption.\n\nNext, I need to analyze the string `t24 t24 t5 t53 t72 t54 t11 t35 t63 t23 t52 t22 t72 t3` and see if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nIn CNF, the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of up to two non-terminals. Since the string is composed of terminals (like t24, t5, etc.), each terminal must correspond to the result of derivations from non-terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string from left to right or right to left, expanding the grammar rules step by step to see if I can match the entire string.\n\nLet me see. The start symbol is S, which expands to NT0 NT4. So S can produce two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4. So initially, the string starts with NT0 NT4? But the string starts with t24 t24 t5..., which are all terminals. So, I think that S must derive to a series of terminals, meaning that after successive expansions, all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT0, NT4, etc., might produce terminals, and each 'derivation' step would replace non-terminals with other non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo, the process would involve expanding S into NT0 NT4, and then each of these non-terminals could further expand, perhaps multiple times, until all symbols in the string are terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should try to build a reduction from the string backward to the start symbol, seeing if each terminal can be matched by a non-terminal's productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a forward approach would be better, but since the string starts with t24, I need to see which non-terminals can derive to t24 through some chain of expansions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see rules where certain non-terminals produce specific terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't72' or NT3 -> 't24'?\n\nWait, let me look through the productions for each non-terminal that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\n\nNT5 -> 't27'\n\nNT7 -> 't43'\n\nNT8 -> 't11'\n\nNT4 -> 't37'\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\n\nNT3 -> 't24'\n\nWait, I see multiple rules where non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 has multiple productions: NT3 -> 't72', NT3 -> 't24', etc.\n\nSo, for the first token 't24', it must come from a non-terminal that can produce 't24' directly. Since in the grammar, NT3 can produce 't24', that's possible. So, the first 't24' comes from NT3.\n\nNow, the structure is S -> NT0 NT4. So, Nbo (non-terminal producing 't24') could be NT3. But how?\n\nWait, no. S -> NT0 NT4, so the first expansion would be S into NT0 and NT4. But the string starts with 't24', which must be the result of NT0 expanding into something, or NT4, depending on how the string is built.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built as a sequence where some non-terminals produce multiple terminals.\n\nWait, this might be getting confusing. Perhaps a better approach is to parse the string step by step, trying to assign each token to a non-terminal's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps building a parse tree from the string would help. Let me try that.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt24, t24, t5, t53, t72, t54, t11, t35, t63, t23, t52, t22, t72, t3.\n\nLet me consider each token and see which non-terminals can produce them.\n\nFirst token: t24. Looking through the productions:\n\nNT3 can produce t72, t24, t53, t31, etc.\n\nSo, t24 could come from NT3 \u2192 't24'.\n\nSimilarly, the second token is another t24, which could also come from NT3.\n\nThird token: t5. Looking for NTs that produce t5. Scanning through:\n\nI don't see any direct rule where a non-terminal produces 't5'. The productions start from 't7', 't43', etc. Wait, maybe I need to check all rules for 't5'. Hmm, in the productions, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't5'. The closest is NT9 -> 't5', NT7 -> 't54', etc. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\nNT9 -> 't5' is present? Wait, in the initial list, I see NT9 -> 't44', 't60', 't54', 't21', 't84', 't81', 't43', 't44', 't64', 't43', 't76', 't57', 't76', 't61', etc., but not a production of the form NTx -> 't5'. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe I misread. Or perhaps t5 comes from a chain of expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nIn the grammar, for example:\n\nNT3 -> 't24' is present.\n\nBut I don't see a production where any non-terminal directly produces 't5'. So the third token is 't5', which might not be directly produced by any rule, so that could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the third token 't5' comes from a non-terminal that can produce 't5' through multiple steps. Let me think.\n\nLooking through the productions, I don't see any direct rule for 't5', but perhaps via some derivations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write down all possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nt24: NT3 \u2192 't24'\n\nt24 again: same NT3.\n\nt5: I don't see any production directly, but perhaps from a non-terminal that can expand to 't5' through two steps.\n\nWait, no. Without a direct production, I can't proceed. So the third token is 't5', and I can't find any non-terminal that directly produces 't5', which would mean this string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in looking through the productions. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the production rules, does any non-terminal produce 't5' directly?\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT8 -> 't9'? No.\n\nNT5 -> 't27'.\n\nNT7 -> 't43', 't57', etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that directly produces 't5'. Therefore, the 't5' in the string would have to be produced by some non-terminal that can expand into a longer sequence, but then we'd have to have 't5' at some point in the expansion, which might not be possible because 't5' isn't directly a terminal but perhaps a longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production S -> NT0 NT4 is the start, and then NT0 and NT4 must derive into sequences ending with 't24' and 't5', respectively.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT, which is NT0, can produce a sequence that results in 't24' as the first symbol, and the second NT, which is NT4, might produce 't5' as the second"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-261","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let me try to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which should make things easier. Each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and exactly two symbols on the right. \n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t77 t61 t3 t63 t15 t64 t13 t72 t40 t7 t74 t57 t12 t80`.\n\nI'm pretty sure the process here is to start from the start symbol S and see if we can derive the string by expanding the non-terminals step by step. But given that the string is quite long and the grammar is extensive, it's going to be a bit complex.\n\nSo, let's start with the start symbol S. According to the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string should be derived from expanding these two non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with t77, which seems to correspond to the production of NT6, since looking through the rules, NT6 \u2192 t77. Wait, let me check: in the rules, NT6 can produce t77 in one of its productions. So maybe NT6 is part of the process.\n\nWait, but let's look at the string again: the first symbol is t77, but if NT6 \u2192 t77, then perhaps S \u2192 NT6 NT4? But S is only supposed to become NT0 NT4. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the first production S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string should be broken down into two parts, the first part derived from NT0 and the second from NT4. So the string should be split into two parts, each corresponding to NT0 and NT4 respectively. Let me check the string: it's 14 tokens. If I split them into two parts after the 7th token, that would make each part 7 tokens. Let's see:\n\nFirst part: t77 t61 t3 t63 t15 t64 t13\nSecond part: t72 t40 t7 t74 t57 t12 t80\n\nDoes that make sense? Let me see if the first part can come from NT0 and the second from NT4.\n\nStarting with NT0: NT0 has several productions. Looking at the rules, NT0 can produce things like NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, NT5 NT5, etc. It also has some terminals. For example, in one of the rules, NT0 \u2192 t23, which is a single terminal. So, the first part of the string needs to be built from NT0, which may produce terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT4's productions include terminals like t37, t5, t8, etc. Let's check NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 ... other long productions, but also some with terminals. For example, looking through the rules, some NT4's productions have t37, t5, t8, etc. So the second part of the string might be built from NT4.\n\nBut wait, looking at the second part: t72 t40 t7 t74 t57 t12 t80. Let me see if that can be derived from NT4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string is built by NT0 and NT4, each producing their own parts. So NT0 would produce the first part, and NT4 would produce the second. Let's check if NT0 can produce the first part and NT4 can produce the second part.\n\nStarting with NT0's productions:\n\nLooking for the first token, which is t77. From the rules, when does NT0 produce a terminal? Looking through the rules, I see that in one production, NT0 \u2192 t23. But t77 is a terminal. So does NT0 ever produce t77?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t77, but NT0's productions don't directly produce t77. Wait, but NT0 can produce NT6 NT7. So maybe the t77 comes from NT6, which is part of NT0's expansion.\n\nSo, for example, if NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then the first token t77 could come from NT6. Let me see if NT6 can produce t77. Looking at the rules, yes: NT6 \u2192 t77 is one of its productions.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I think I might have confused NT6. Wait, the productions for NT6 include several, but in the rules provided, it's listed that NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, NT8 NT9, NT6 NT0, NT2 NT0, etc. I also see that NT6 has a production that directly goes to a terminal, like t77. Let me check:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, here's a rule: NT6 \u2192 t77. So yes, NT6 can produce directly t77. So if NT6 is part of NT0's expansion, then it can produce t77.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second part of the string: the last token is t80. From the rules, NT0 can produce t23, but that's a single terminal. t80 is another terminal. Looking at NT0's rules, do any of them directly produce t80? Let me check: I see NT0 \u2192 t43, t73, t28, t62, etc., but I don't see t80 as a direct production. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe t80 is part of another non-terminal's expansion.\n\nWait, maybe the second part is derived from NT4, which might have some rules that produce the required tokens. Let's look for t72 in the second part.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT4, I see several options, but I don't immediately see t72 as a direct production. But maybe through a chain of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is not compatible with the grammar, but I need a more systematic approach.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to think in terms of the entire string being a concatenation of symbols produced by the two non-terminals NT0 and NT4. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the string should be NT0's expansion followed by NT4's expansion.\n\nSo let me split the string into two parts at some point. The first part would be parsed by NT0, the second by NT4.\n\nLooking for a split where the first part can be generated by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nLet me attempt a split after 7 tokens:\n\nFirst part: t77 t61 t3 t63 t15 t64 t13\n\nSecond part: t72 t40 t7 t74 t57 t12 t80\n\nNow, check if the first part can come from NT0 and the second from NT4.\n\nFor the first part, starting with t77. As we saw earlier, t77 is from NT6 \u2192 t77. So perhaps the first expansion of NT0 is through NT6.\n\nSo let's see: NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nSo, starting with NT0, if it expands to NT6 NT7, then the first token would be t77 (from NT6), then the next token(s) would come from NT7.\n\nLooking at the first part: t77 t61 t3 t63 t15 t64 t13.\n\nAfter t77, the next token is t61. So we have t77 followed by t61. So perhaps t77 is from NT6, and the next part is from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7, let's see what its productions are. NT7 has several rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT7 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- ... others\n\nLooking for a production that can produce something that would lead to t61. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT7 \u2192 ... something that can produce t61. Or perhaps, maybe t61 is from a non-terminal derived from NT7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t61 is a terminal. So if t61 is a terminal, does any of NT7's productions produce t61?\n\nLooking through the rules for NT7, all the productions are into other non-terminals except if any have terminals. Let me check:\n\nNo, I don't see NT7 having a direct terminal production. So t61 must come from a non-terminal that can produce a string that starts with t61.\n\nWait, maybe t61 is produced by another non-terminal downstream. So let's consider that t61 is part of the NT7 expansion. So let's see if the expansion can produce t61 as the second token.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me try to see if any of the non-terminals can produce the required sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial split is not at 7 tokens. Maybe the split is different. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the second part:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-288","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (ChNF). The string is \"t24 t15 t61 t22 t80 t15 t14 t9 t74 t72 t27 t72 t40 t21 t69\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a CFG in Chomsky Normal Form looks like. ChNF is a specific form where the grammar consists of productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol doesn't appear on the right-hand side (RHS) of any production except possibly the start.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, all strings derived from this grammar will start with two non-terminals. The string in question starts with \"t24\", which is a terminal, so that makes sense because S produces NT0 NT4, which are both non-terminals.\n\nThe next step is to look at all the productions and terminals. I notice that many non-terminals eventually lead to terminals like 't' followed by numbers. Each production in the grammar has either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the string should consist of a sequence of terminals, and each terminal must be derived from some non-terminal production.\n\nI'll start breaking down the string step by step. Let's consider each token and see if it can be derived from any production in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t24 t15 t61 t22 t80 t15 t14 t9 t74 t72 t27 t72 t40 t21 t69.\n\nLet's list them:\n\n1. t24\n2. t15\n3. t61\n4. t22\n5. t80\n6. t15\n7. t14\n8. t9\n9. t74\n10. t72\n11. t27\n12. t72\n13. t40\n14. t21\n15. t69\n\nI need to see if each of these can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for each terminal, we can check if there's a production that leads to it.\n\nFirst, t24: Looking through the grammar, I see production NT24? Wait, no, the non-terminals are all named NT followed by numbers, like NT0, NT1, etc. Looking for NT that produce 't24' or any corresponding terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3, NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6, etc. Hmm, maybe it's complicated to track from the non-terminals to the terminals. Alternatively, perhaps some terminals are directly produced, like 't14' from NT2 where NT2 \u2192 't7' 't2'? Wait, actually, looking at the grammar, for NT2, there's a production NT2 \u2192 't7' 't2'. So 't7' is part of this, but t7 is another terminal. So to get t72, let's see if that's derived from NT72, but wait, in the grammar, all the NTs are combinations, like NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for each terminal and see if there's a path in the grammar that can produce them. Alternatively, perhaps all terminals in the string are of the form t followed by a two-digit number, so maybe they are directly produced by non-terminals that have productions ending in those terminals.\n\nWait, for instance, looking at the grammar, I can see that some non-terminals have productions ending with 't14', because I see NT2 \u2192 't7' 't2'\u2014if 't7' is 't7', then t2 would be, but looking further, perhaps NT2 also has other productions. Wait, looking back, I think it's better to list all non-terminals and their possible terminal outputs.\n\nLet me go through each non-terminal and see which terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT2, NT5, NT9, etc. Wait, no, actually, looking at the grammar, many of the productions are of the form NTn \u2192 NTm NTk, but some have terminals. For example, looking through the list:\n\nWait, the initial given grammar has a lot of lines, but I think it's challenging to list all non-terminals. However, some of them seem to directly produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT4 \u2192 't32' and NT2 \u2192 't7' and 't2', etc. Wait, let me find all the productions that directly produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3', 't10', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't43', 't5', 't33', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't23', among others.\n- NT4 \u2192 't37', 't8', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't7', 't9', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't76', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't44', 't51', 't43', 't61', etc.\n\nEach of these non-terminals can produce a terminal.\n\nNow, if each token in the string is a combination of these terminals, derived via non-terminals, then the string can be generated. But since it's in Chomsky Normal Form, every production is either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of terminals, so each symbol must be derived from a terminal production.\n\nSo each token in the string must be directly produced by some non-terminal, i.e., there must be a production NT \u2192 't...', where 't... is one of the tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the string tokens:\n\nt24, t15, t61, t22, t80, t15, t14, t9, t74, t72, t27, t72, t40, t21, t69.\n\nI don't see any non-terminals in the grammar that directly produce 't24', 't15', 't61', etc. All the terminal productions have specific 't' followed by two numbers, but I'm not sure if any non-terminal directly produces these specific combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check. Looking through the grammar, some non-terminals do produce terminals:\n\nFor example, NT4 \u2192 't32', so 't32' is produced by NT4.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 \u2192 't7', 't2', etc.\n\nLooking for 't24'\u2014is there any non-terminal that can produce 't24'? I don't see that. Similarly, 't15'\u2014is there a production like NT15 \u2192 't15'? Looking through the list, I see NT15, but I should check if there's a production NT15 \u2192 't15'. Wait, in the grammar, looking for something like NTxxxx \u2192 't15'.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I think each production that ends with a 't' is a terminal production. So I should check if any of the productions end with these 't' tokens.\n\nLooking back at the provided grammar, for example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't37', 't8', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't76', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't10', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't43', 't5', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't23', 't43', etc.\n- NT2 \u2192 't7', 't2', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't44', 't61', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't11', 't5', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nLooking at these, none of the grammar productions directly produce 't24', which is in the string. So if 't24' cannot be produced by any terminal production in the grammar, then the string cannot be generated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Maybe the non-terminals can derive 't24' through a chain of productions. For example, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and so on, until I reach a terminal.\n\nBut in order for 't24' to be in the string, it must be the result of some production. So if there's no production that directly produces 't24', then it's impossible. Therefore, the answer would be No.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed some production.

{"custom_id":"request-280","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the string `t81 t9 t60 t40 t76 t53 t70 t27 t81 t10 t5 t76 t62 t77 t39` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I recall that the Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each rule has either two terminals or a non-terminal on the left. The grammar provided seems to be in CNF because all the productions on the left side are single non-terminals, and the right sides are either pairs of non-terminals or terminal pairs. I should verify a few of these. For example, `S -> NT0 NT4` is good. `NT0 -> NT6 NT7` is also fine because it's a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals. Similarly, other productions like `NT2 -> 't7' NT2` seem to mix terminals and non-terminals, which might not fit CNF directly. Wait, in CNF, each production can only have terminals on the left side? No, wait. No, CNF requires that every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, if a production has a mix, like A -> aB or Ba, it's not in CNF. Looking back, for example, `NT2 -> 't7' NT2` is mixed. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Oh wait, wait, in the given grammar, I see `NT2 -> 't7' NT2`. That's a production with a terminal followed by a non-terminal. That doesn't fit CNF. Did I misread it?\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar provided isn't strictly in CNF as I thought. But the question says it's given in CNF, so I might have misread some of the productions. Maybe some have the non-terminals on the left, but I should proceed.\n\nNext, the string provided is a series of t-terms, like t81, t9, etc. The grammar has some rules where each NT can produce other NTs or some terminals. For example, `NT0 -> 't23'` and `NT3 -> 't53'` are terminal productions. So the strategy would be to parse the string from the start symbol, which is S, and see if the entire string can be derived through the grammar.\n\nBut manually doing a full parse for a string of 15 symbols sounds tedious. Maybe a better approach is to check if each element in the string matches a left-hand side (LHS) of a production, or if it's built from the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to find a parse tree for the given string. The string is `t81 t9 t60 t40 t76 t53 t70 t27 t81 t10 t5 t76 t62 t77 t39`. That's 15 tokens. Let's list them in order: 0 to 14.\n\nI might start from the start symbol S and see how it can produce the string. S -> NT0 NT4. So S should generate first an NT0 and then an NT4.\n\nSo, the string starts with t81, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT0 can produce 't23' directly, but t81 is 't81'. Wait, looking through the grammar rules for NT X -> 't?':\n\nLooking for any NT X where X can produce 't81'. I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT26 -> 't26' (NT6 -> 't77'... Wait, maybe I'm looking for NTs that directly produce t81.\n\nWait, looking through the given rules, the only NT that directly produces t81 seems to be NT7 -> 't54'? Wait no, t54 is 't54'.\n\nWait, checking all the NT rules that directly produce t-values:\n\nLooking through each production where the RHS is a terminal, for example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7' (but that's NT2 -> 't7' NT2? Wait, looking again: no, I think I may have misread. Let me re-express the grammar.\n\nWait, I think I misread earlier. Let's list some rules:\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT2 -> 't7' NT2: So this is a mixed production, which would not fit CNF. Hmm, this complicates things. Similarly, other NTs have mixed productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the grammar presentation, and some rules are misaligned. Alternatively, perhaps the string to parse uses only terminals, and the NTs correspond to the parse tree nodes. But maybe I need to find a better way.\n\nAnother approach: since the string is a sequence of terminals, perhaps the entire string must be a derivation starting from S. So, perhaps each terminal in the string must be matched by a production in the grammar. The start is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So, the first step is to split the string into two parts: one from NT0 and the other from NT4.\n\nThe string is 15 symbols, so let me see if I can split it into two parts. For example, the first part is some symbols producing NT0, and the second part is some symbols producing NT4.\n\nLooking at the first symbols: t81, t9, t60, t40, t76, t53, t70, t27, t81, etc.\n\nIf I assume that the first part (before some splitting point) is from NT0, and the second part is from NT4, then I need to see if there's a splitting point such that the first part can be derived from NT0 and the second from NT4.\n\nBut considering the entire string is long, maybe it's better to check if each token in the string can be matched by the grammar, starting from S and branching as needed.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is to see if the sequence can be generated by S. Let's try to see the first few symbols.\n\nThe string starts with t81.\n\nLooking for which NTs can produce t81 directly. Looking through all rules for NT X -> a where 'a' is a terminal, we have:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT2 -> 't7' (but mixed with another NT)\nNT22 -> 't81'? Wait, looking through the given rules:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nNT7 -> 't54'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nWait, looking through each production, some have terminals on the right:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't7' NT2 (but perhaps it can derive t7 eventually)\nWait, but to get t81, we might need a specific rule where NT X -> 't81'.\n\nLooking through each NT's production, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces 't81'. So perhaps the production of t81 comes from a chain of derivations. For example, one NT may produce another NT that can produce t81.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible that multiple NTs can produce certain terminals through their productions.\n\nWait, for example, looking at NT7's production: NT7 -> NT0 NT4. If NT0 can produce 't23' and NT4 can produce... well, NT4 -> 't32'? Let's see.\n\nWait, looking at NT4's rules:\n\nNT4 -> 't32' (from a rule? Let me check: Yes, one of the rules is 't32' in some context. So if NT4 can produce 't32', then NT7 can produce NT0 NT4, which is 't23' and 't32', so concatenating gives 't23 t32'. But that's not t81.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm seeing other NTs. For example, looking for any NT that can directly produce 't81'. I don't see such a rule immediately, so maybe it's produced via a combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each t-symbol in the string corresponds directly to a terminal in some production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parsing is possible by recursively breaking down the string into the NTs and their respective productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by S, and each NT can generate a certain part of the string. So, for S -> NT0 NT4, the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nSo, the string is split into two parts: the first part is produced by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nSo, let's try to split the string into two consecutive parts:\n\nSuppose the split is after the 7th symbol, so first 8 symbols: t81 t9 t60 t40 t76 t53 t70 t27\n\nand the second part: t81 t10 t5 t76 t62 t77 t39"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t17 t5 t70 t3 t10 t60 t81 t72 t17 t47 t74 t56 t57`, and the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar rules to see how tokens are generated.

The grammar seems to have a lot of production rules. Let me try to map each token to a rule.\n\nI notice that many tokens like t17, t5, t70, etc., are directly generated by specific non-terminals.

Looking at the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't17' as one of the rules. So S must start with NT4 NT0 (since S \u2192 NT0 NT4), but here we have 't17' as the first token, which is generated by NT4. So perhaps the expansion starts with NT0 NT4.\n\nWait, but S is defined as NT0 NT4. So the first step in the derivation would expand S into NT0 and NT4. The first token is 't17', which is from NT4. Let's see:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 (some expansion) starting with NT4 \u2192 't17'\n\nWait, but NT4 can expand into multiple terms.

Hmm, 't5' is generated by NT0 and NT7.\n\nWait, no, looking at the user's input, I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't5' (from the list, yes, there's a rule). So 't5' can come from NT0 or NT7.\n\nThen t70: Let's see.

From the grammar, I can see:\n\n- `t13` comes from NT4 \u2192 't13'\n- `t37` comes from NT3 \u2192 't37'\n- `t70` comes from NT7 \u2192 't70'\n\nWait, the string has `t7`, `t26`, `t9`, etc. Let me list out each terminal and find their source non-terminals:\n\n1. `t13` \u2192 NT4\n2. `t77` \u2192 Wait, the NT6 productions end with 't60' and 't83', and there's `t77`? Hmm, looking back, I don't see `t77` directly in the grammar. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 't60', 't83', and some other combinations. No `t77` here. Wait, is there another production that leads to `t77`? Let me scan more carefully.\n\nAh, under NT8, I see `t56` and other terminals, but no `t77`. Wait, maybe it's produced by a chain. For example, if NT6 can go to NT9 and NT8, and NT6 is 't77' somewhere. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me look again.\n\nWait, maybe `t77` comes from NT6, but how? Looking at NT6, the productions include 't60' and 't83', but that's all. Maybe `t77` is produced by another route, perhaps through a combination? Or maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the assumption that each terminal maps to a specific non-terminal as per the given productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me see the grammar again:\n\nLooking at NT0, NT4, etc., I see that some of them directly map to terminals, like NT4 \u2192 't13', NT0 \u2192 't23', etc. So for the given string, each terminal corresponds to a specific non-terminal.\n\nNow, the string is `t13 t77 t64 t52 t44 t73 t21 t10 t33 t11 t7 t26 t9 t72 t31 t70`.\n\nLet me map each terminal to its source non-terminal:\n\n1. t13 \u2192 NT4\n2. t77 \u2192 Wait, I don't see `t77` in the grammar directly. Only `t37`, `t13`, etc. So perhaps t77 comes from a higher non-terminal that can produce it. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't72', but that's t72, not t77. Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't56', but our string has t52, t21, etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list each terminal in the string with their possible sources:\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt13 \u2192 NT4 (since NT4 -> 't13')\nt77 \u2192 Hmm, not directly. Maybe it's produced by NT0 or another non-terminal that splits into parts leading to t77. Wait, perhaps I'm missing that NT6 can produce t77? Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT6 has productions: NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, and NT6 \u2192 't60', 't83'. No 't77' here. So how is t77 being generated? Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Perhaps the string has a typo, but I don't think so. Alternatively, maybe it's produced via another path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t77 comes from NT7 or NT8. Let me check NT7 productions: NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6, etc. NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0, etc. NT4 can produce t13, etc. But I'm not seeing a direct way to get t77.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that t77 is generated by a more complex derivation, like through multiple non-terminals. For example, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, and maybe NT9 or NT8 can produce terminals. But in the given grammar, NT9 \u2192 't44' among other things, not t77. So maybe t77 is generated by some longer chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the grammar. Let me look again. Oh, I see that NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8 and also NT6 \u2192 't77'? Wait, no, in the initial grammar, looking back:\n\nWait the initial grammar provided starts with:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\n... and then many other productions, including some direct terminals.\n\nWait, I think I may have misread earlier. Let me scan through the grammar more carefully to see if any non-terminal directly produces t77.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I now see that in the grammar, I spot NT8 \u2192 't51', but that's not t77. Wait, no.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nHere's a part of the grammar:\n\nNT8 -> NT6 NT0\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT8 -> NT5 NT3\n\nWait, elsewhere in the grammar:\n\nWait, here's the grammar as provided:\n\n...\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT3 -> 't76'\nNT5 -> 't27'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't32'\n...\n\nThen, for example:\n\nNT8 -> 't56'\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing a production that leads to t77. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake, perhaps t77 comes from NT6, but looking more carefully through the grammar, I see that NT6 has several productions, but none that result in 't77'. So maybe the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar, making it impossible to generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that NT8 \u2192 't56' and NT6 \u2192 't83' and 't60'... Wait, no 't77' found. So perhaps the string has a terminal that's not present in the grammar. If that's the case, then the string cannot be generated, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing how t77 is generated. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but I have to go with the given string.\n\nSo, looking at `t77`, if it doesn't appear in any production rule of the grammar, then the grammar cannot produce that terminal, which would mean the string isn't in the language. Therefore, the answer would be 'No'.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake because in the grammar provided, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2. Let's see: if NT6 can split into NT0 and NT2, which can further split into other terminals. Let me try to see if any of these can produce t77.\n\nSo, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Let's see:\n\nNT0 can go to NT6 NT7 or other combinations, and NT4 can go to 't13'.

{"custom_id":"request-323","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar looks quite complex with a lot of productions, and the string to evaluate is a series of 't' words. \n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. In our case, the grammar follows this structure because all productions either produce two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t67 t70 t23 t17 t51 t54 t23 t22 t77 t27 t11 t11 t10 t31 t21 t61 t17`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. To do this, I think the best approach is to perform a derivation starting from the start symbol S and see if I can reach the given string. Alternatively, since the grammar is large, maybe I can break it down into smaller parts.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that it starts with 't67' and ends with 't17'. So, I need to find if there's a production that can generate 't67' either directly or through a series of productions. Let's check the grammar to see where 't67' comes from.\n\nLooking at the productions, I see that 't67' is produced by the rule NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9. But wait, actually, looking at the grammar, I see that some non-terminals turn into 't' when they can't go further. For example, NT6 can produce 't77' or 't43', etc. But where does 't67' come from? Looking through, I see:\n\nNT6 -> t83 or from NT4 etc., but not directly. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's check the productions more closely. I think I need to scan the grammar for any production that directly produces a 't' with the correct index.\n\nWait, no, that's not how it works. The 't' symbols are the terminals, and each terminal is a single character. So, for example, 't67' is a single terminal symbol. So, in the grammar, some non-terminals produce sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, all the productions seem to produce pairs of non-terminals or a single terminal. For example, NT6 -> NT7 NT9, but then NT7 and NT9 might produce terminals or more non-terminals. So, perhaps 't67' is produced by a chain of productions.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the productions again. For example, NT6 is defined as NT7 NT9 in multiple places. Let's see where 't67' comes from as a terminal. Looking through the productions, I see:\n\nLooking for 't67', maybe it's produced by some production. Let me check each production for terminals.\n\nLooking through, I see NT6 \u2192 t83, but that's t83, not t67. Hmm. Let me check all productions for terminals:\n\nWait, here's a list of productions that produce terminals:\n\nNT3 \u2192 t72\nNT5 \u2192 t47\nNT7 \u2192 t13\nNT9 \u2192 t43\nNT8 \u2192 t11\nNT0 \u2192 t23\nNT2 \u2192 t7\nNT4 \u2192 t32\nNT3 \u2192 t70\nNT6 \u2192 t83\nNT8 \u2192 t5\nNT4 \u2192 t3\nNT7 \u2192 t43\nNT4 \u2192 t8\nNT3 \u2192 t53\nNT3 \u2192 t31\nNT5 \u2192 t10\nNT0 \u2192 t43\nNT2 \u2192 t26\nNT9 \u2192 t60\nNT8 \u2192 t21\nNT4 \u2192 t84\nNT8 \u2192 t81\nNT0 \u2192 t28\nNT4 \u2192 t7\nNT0 \u2192 t62\nNT2 \u2192 t26\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me go step by step.\n\nI think it's better to see what each non-terminal can produce. For example, NT6 can produce t77 or t43 from the production NT6 \u2192 t77 or NT6 \u2192 t43. Wait, no, looking again:\n\nWait, the productions for NT6 are:\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT6 -> NT3 NT9\nNT6 -> NT8 NT7\n\nWait, no. The user provided a very long grammar. Let's see if any of these production rules produce a 't' directly.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, I don't see any that produce a single 't' directly. All seem to go into more non-terminals. So to get a terminal like t67, there must be a derivation path where it's reached through a series of productions that terminate in terminals.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to see which non-terminals can produce t67. But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nGiven the string starts with t67, so the first step of the derivation must be S \u2192 NT0 NT4 (from the first rule of the grammar). So, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which then must produce t67 ... etc. So, NT0 must eventually produce the first part of the string, and NT4 must produce the remainder.\n\nLooking at NT0, let's check what it can produce. From the grammar, NT0 is part of S's production. Let's look for where NT0 can lead:\n\nLooking through the productions for NT0, I see several:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT7 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT5\n...and so on. It seems that NT0 can produce various combinations, but I'm not seeing where it can produce t67.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the productions for NT0 to see if it can directly produce any 't's. So, looking through:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t77 (from NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9 and then maybe NT9 \u2192 t43, NT7 \u2192 t13: but wait, perhaps a longer chain. Alternatively, does any production of NT0 produce a 't'?\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I think I might have missed it. Let me scan through all the productions for NT0.\n\nNo, in the grammar provided, NT0's productions all seem to be either combinations of other non-terminals or in one case, NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT7 and another, but none directly produce a 't'. For example:\n\nLooking, I don't see any production where NT0 directly becomes a 't' except possibly indirectly through multiple steps.\n\nWait, no, NT0's productions are all combinations, so to get a 't', we'd have to go through a chain of productions that eventually terminate in a terminal.\n\nSo, for example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so NT0 would produce a sub-string ending with t67. Let's look at the first token: t67. So, the substring starting with t67 must be produced by some combination starting from NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as parsing the string step by step, breaking it down into possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the fact that each production in CNF produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or the terminal. So the string length would determine the number of production steps, and whether each step breaks down correctly.\n\nThe given string has 17 tokens: t67, t70, t23, t17, t51, t54, t23, t22, t77, t27, t11, t11, t10, t31, t21, t61, t17. Since each step either splits a symbol into two (so length doubles each time) or not, but in CNF, each step is a single split, so the total number of steps would be log2(n), but the string length here is 17, which is not a power of 2. So, perhaps the length is 17, meaning the number of steps would be 16 (since each step doubles the length). But 2^4 is 16, so 5 steps would give 32 symbols, which is longer than 17. So maybe it's not a straightforward parse. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a parse tree for the given string. Starting from the start symbol S, which produces NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, let me try to break down the string into possible parts that match NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet's consider the first part as NT0 producing t67... I need to see if there's a way to split"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me start by understanding the grammar structure and the string we're evaluating.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. All productions except the start symbol are between two non-terminals or are terminals.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, it's quite extensive with many production rules. Each non-terminal seems to produce a combination of other non-terminals until it eventually produces a terminal symbol, often 't' followed by a number, or a space between the nodes.\n\nThe string to be evaluated is a sequence of terminal symbols: t53, t39, t37, t47, t67, t57, t23, t76, t2, t69, t60, t70, t37, t76, t27, t17, t74. It's important to note that these are all single tokens consisting of 't' followed by a number or a space.\n\nIn CNF, to derive a string, the parse tree must be a full binary tree where each node has exactly two children, corresponding to the two symbols in each production rule. Each terminal in the string corresponds to a production that directly produces a terminal symbol.\n\nGiven the string's length is 17 tokens, I should check if the parse tree for this string has 17 leaves. In a full binary tree, the number of leaves is one more than the number of internal nodes. So, for 17 leaves, there would be 16 internal nodes. Since each internal node corresponds to a production rule that consumes two symbols, the total number of steps in the derivation would be equal to the number of internal nodes.\n\nHowever, this might be a bit abstract. Maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree incrementally, starting from the root and seeing if we can break down the string into the required productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S -> NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols generated by S would be NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet's look at the string: the first two tokens are t53 and t39. So we need to see if NT0 can produce t53 and NT4 can produce t39, or vice versa.\n\nWait, no, because in CNF, each production is applied as a unit. So S -> NT0 NT4 would mean that the entire string must be derived from NT0 followed by NT4. So the first part of the string (t53 t39) should come from NT0, and the second part (t37 t47 t67 t57 t23 t76 t2 t69 t60 t70 t37 t76 t27 t17 t74) should come from NT4.\n\nBut NT4's production rules are:\n\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT6 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT3\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3 (but this is recursion and since CNF shouldn't have left recursion, this might have been removed already)\nNT4 -> NT3 NT2\n\nSo NT4 can derive several combinations. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string starting from the second token: t37 is the third token. Wait, hold on, the first token after S would be the first production's first symbol, then the second production's second symbol. Hmm, maybe I should break down the string step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by parsing the string using the given grammar.\n\nLet me list the string's tokens in order:\n\n1. t53\n2. t39\n3. t37\n4. t47\n5. t67\n6. t57\n7. t23\n8. t76\n9. t2\n10. t69\n11. t60\n12. t70\n13. t37\n14. t76\n15. t27\n16. t17\n17. t74\n\nWait, the first token is t53, so according to S -> NT0 NT4, NT0 must produce t53, and NT4 must produce the rest starting with t39.\n\nSo, NT0 must produce t53. Looking at the grammar for NT0:\n\nNT0's productions are:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT7 NT0\nNT0 -> NT9 NT0\nNT0 -> NT5 NT2\nNT0 -> NT9 NT2\nNT0 -> NT6 NT9\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nWait, perhaps I need to check if any of the NT0 productions result in a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at all NT0 rules, each seems to produce a combination of NT0, NT5, NT6, NT7, etc. None of them directly produce a terminal symbol. All NT0 rules produce two non-terminals. Therefore, NT0 cannot immediately produce t53. This suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect because S produces NT0 NT4, and if NT0 can't directly produce a terminal, then the string can't have a starting t53.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar because the first symbol t53 can't be produced by NT0. Let me make sure I didn't miss any NT0 rule that ends in a terminal. Looking back, all NT0 rules are combinations of other non-terminals. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way for NT0 to produce t53 through a series of productions. But looking at the NT0 rules, none of them are directly producing t53. So perhaps the string isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the string. Let me check: the string starts with t53, but is it possible that the string is split differently? For example, perhaps it's t5 followed by t3, but no, the tokens are individual t with numbers, not single digits. So each token is like t53, which is a single symbol.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol t53 cannot be derived from NT0, which is the first part of S's production.\n<\/think>\n\nNo\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\nTo determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar, we start by analyzing the start symbol S which produces NT0 NT4. NT0 must generate the first token of the string, which is t53. However, examining NT0's production rules reveals that all are combinations of other non-terminals and do not produce a terminal symbol directly, unlike some in the grammar. Thus, it is impossible for NT0 to generate t53, making the string unparable under the given grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each NT is a non-terminal that eventually produces terminal symbols (t's with numbers) or other non-terminals.\n\nThe given string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces: `t20 t84 t42 t80 t81 t64 t23 t69 t32 t74 t67 t39 t8 t15 t5 t13 t17 t53`. So, it's 18 symbols long.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I'll need to see if it can be derived from S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure. The string starts with t20, which is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, which NT produces t20? Scanning the productions, I see:\n\n- NT9 -> 't43'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't54'\n- NT4 -> 't32' (Wait, no, looking again, I think I might have misread. Let me check each production.)\n\nWait, looking for t20: Checking the NT productions:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't33'\n- NT7 -> 't54'\n- NT4 -> 't32' (Wait, no, NT4 is in the productions, let me check which one gives t20. From the list:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT9 -> 't43', NT8 -> 't5', NT7 -> 't54', NT4 -> 't32' (I think I might have misread earlier). Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the list:\n\n- NT9: ends with 't43'\n- NT8: ends with 't11', 't21', 't53'\n- NT7: ends with 't54'\n- NT4: ends with 't32', 't5'\nWait, I see NT4 -> 't5' and NT4 has another production 't8' etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should find which non-terminals can produce t20. Looking through all productions, do any produce 't20'?\n\nLooking through each NT:\n\n- NT9: 't43'\n- NT8: 't5', 't21', 't53'\n- NT7: 't54', 't57'\n- NT4: 't32', 't8', 't5', 't9', etc.\n- NT0: 't23', 't64', etc.\n- NT5: 't33', etc.\n- NT3: 't53', 't72', 't39', etc.\n- NT2: 't7', etc.\n\nI don't see any NT directly producing 't20'. That seems problematic because the string starts with 't20', but none of the NTs directly produce it. That would suggest the string cannot be produced by the grammar, which would answer 'No'. However, maybe there's a rule that indirectly produces t20 through a chain of derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a production. Let me check all NT productions again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, the NTs are:\n\nS, NT7, NT5, NT6, NT0, NT2, NT4, NT8, NT3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking.

{"custom_id":"request-342","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let me try to figure out how to determine if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar is trying to describe. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left side, and either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I see that the start symbol is S, which directly produces NT0 NT4. Each of these non-terminals then further break down into rules, with NTs often combining other NTs or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of tokens: `t47 t37 t83 t83 t39 t12 t44 t23 t9 t8 t84 t60 t57 t28 t63 t40 t54 t83`.\n\nI think I should attempt to parse this string using the given grammar. Parsing in CNF can be done using a recursive descent approach or a dynamic programming method, but since I'm doing this manually, I can try to apply the productions step by step.\n\nStarting with the entire string, I need to see if it can be derived from S. S produces NT0 NT4. So the first step would be to split the string into parts that match NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0 and NT4's productions, I see that NT4 can produce things like t47, t37, etc. Let me look for these tokens in the string.\n\nIn the string, I see 't47' and 't37'. Maybe NT4 can produce these. Wait, actually, in the grammar, NT4's productions are a bit complex. For example, NT4 -> NT5 NT2, or NT4 -> NT4 NT3, etc. But it also directly produces terms like 't37' (I think, looking for 't' followed by a number).\n\nWait, in the grammar, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT3 -> 't72' and others. So I can look for NT3 in the string and see if it produces t72, etc.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production step processes a substring as a single symbol (either a terminal or a non-terminal derived into terminals).\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT4. So I need to parse the entire string into NT0 NT4, which would split the string into two parts: one that NT0 produces and another that NT4 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with 't47', which might come from NT4's production. Let's see NT4's options:\n\nNT4 can produce 't37', 't44', etc. Wait, actually, looking in the rules for NT4, I see NT4 -> 't37' (looking for rows that end with terminal). Wait, in the grammar, under NT4, I see:\n\nNT4 -> 't37' (I think). Let me check the given grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see several lines where NT4 produces things like 't37', 't5', etc. For example, in the last lines:\n\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT4 -> 't9'\nAnd others. So one of NT4's possible terminals is 't37', which is present in the string.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 can produce 't83', which is in the string, as I see 't83' in the string.\n\nWait, but NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals, so I can't directly use them as terminals. So the initial split would have to be that the entire string is parsed into NT0 and NT4, meaning the first part is parsed into NT0, and the second part is parsed into NT4.\n\nSo let me split the string into two parts:\n\nFirst part: 't47' ... (all tokens until NT4 is parsed)\nSecond part: the remaining tokens should be parsed into NT4.\n\nLooking for NT4's production, it can directly produce 't37', 't44', etc. 't47' is in the second part. Wait, 't47' is the first token, but according to S's production, S is NT0 NT4, which would split the entire string into two sequences: the first for NT0 and the second for NT4.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: The string is a sequence of tokens, each of which is either a terminal or a non-terminal. Wait, no, in the grammar, non-terminals are represented as NT followed by numbers. So, for example, S -> NT0 NT4, which would mean that when parsing S, we're expecting the entire string to be split into two parts: one that becomes NT0 and the other that becomes NT4.\n\nSo let's try to parse the entire string:\n\nThe entire string is: t47 t37 t83 t83 t39 t12 t44 t23 t9 t8 t84 t60 t57 t28 t63 t40 t54 t83\n\nSo, it's 18 tokens. Let's see if the entire string can be parsed as NT0 followed by NT4.\n\nSo, first, parse the first part as NT0, and the remaining as NT4.\n\nBut how does that work? Let's say NT0 can produce a certain sequence of terminals, and NT4 can produce another.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is using a recursive descent parser, trying to parse the string into NT0 and then NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into the production of S, which is NT0 NT4, so the string should be a concatenation of the strings produced by NT0 and NT4.\n\nSo let's look for the point where the string splits into NT0 and NT4. For example, the first part ends before the first non-terminal, and the second part starts with the NT4's symbols.\n\nWait, but the string is composed of terminals, but in Chomsky Normal Form, the grammar can generate a string by replacing the initial symbols with other symbols until only terminals are left. So the string is a sequence of terminals. Therefore, the entire string must be the result of starting from S and replacing each non-terminal in the derivation with their productions until only terminals remain.\n\nSo, to check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there exists a way to produce this string by applying the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, I can try to find if it's generated by NT0 and NT4 concatenated.\n\nSo perhaps using the S rule first: S -> NT0 NT4. That would mean the entire string is the concatenation of the production of NT0 and the production of NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, I need to check if it can be split into two parts, each being the production of NT0 and NT4 respectively, and the concatenation of these two parts equals the original string.\n\nSo, let's look at NT0 and NT4's possible productions.\n\nLooking at NT0, it has several productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT5 NT6\nNT0 -> NT7 NT9\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT6 NT0\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT0 NT2\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT9 NT0\nAnd others, but most are combinations of NTs.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has several productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT3 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT0 NT8\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT3\nAnd more.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to work from the end of the string and see if the last part can be derived from NT4, and check if the remaining part can be derived from NT0.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part (before the last 't83') would be up to index 16 (since it's 0-based, the last token is at 17), but wait the string has 18 tokens (indices 0-17). So maybe it's better to split from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to try to find a way to split the entire string into two parts that each correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut this might take a lot of steps. Alternatively, let's look for the possible endpoints.\n\nLooking at the string, I see 't83 t83 t47 t37 ...'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NTs produce 't' tokens. For example:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT8 -> 't11'\nOther NTs have similar terminal productions.\n\nSo, perhaps I can find in the string a terminal that comes directly from an NT's production.\n\nLooking at the string, 't47' is present. Looking back at the grammar, I see NT5 -> 't47', and NT7 -> 't13', etc. So maybe 't47' is"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, let's see. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for terminals which can be either single symbols or variables. Wait, no, in CNF, all productions are left-hand side being a single non-terminal, and right-hand side being two non-terminals, unless it's the start symbol producing a single terminal. But here, I see that most productions go to two non-terminals, except for some that go to terminals.\n\nFirst, I should probably list out all the production rules for the non-terminals and see if I can build the parse tree for the given string. The given string is a sequence of terminals, all of which seem to be two-letter abbreviations like t8, t35, etc. My approach should be to try to match the string by considering possible derivations using the given grammar.\n\nLet me look at the grammar again. The start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So to generate the string, the start would break down into NT0 and NT4.

I need to see which non-terminals produce t8. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT8 can produce t8, among others. For example, NT4 -> t8, and also NT8 can produce t8.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT4 has a production NT8 NT6, and NT8 has a production that includes t8 in one of its rules. Let me check the specific productions:\n\n- NT8-> t8... yes, for example, NT8->'t83' or maybe another rule leads to t8. Wait, looking through the non-terminals, I see:\n\nLooking for NT8\u2192 t8: No, but looking for NT8-> t8. Hmm, maybe I misremember. The grammar's productions are given in a list, so I should parse them more carefully.\n\nWait, for NT8: let me see:\n\nThe grammar has NT8-> NT5 NT3, and also NT8-> NT6 NT0. No direct production that ends with 't8'. Wait, perhaps NT8 can go to 't8'? Let me scan through the grammar:\n\nLooking for 't8':\n\nLooking through the list, I see:\n\n- NT3->t83: 't83' is a terminal.\n- Also, in NT2->'t7', 't84', etc. Wait, looking for 't8':\n\nLooking at the productions, I see NT0->'t80', NT2->'t26', NT3->'t24', etc. Oh, wait, in the productions, I see that NT3-> 't72' and 't70' etc., but 't8' as a terminal only appears once: in the production NT4-> 't8'. No, wait, let's see:\n\nLooking at the productions for terminals, I see:\n\n- NT3-> 't72'\n- NT8-> 't83'\n- NT5-> 't47'\n- NT4-> 't32'\n- NT7-> 't13'\n- NT6-> 't83'? Wait, no, looking through all the productions, I think 't8' as a terminal doesn't appear except once, but maybe in one of the productions.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I realize that some non-terminals like NT0, NT2, NT3, etc., are defined only in terms of other non-terminals except for some cases where they produce a single terminal. Wait, no, because the grammar is in CNF, so all productions are two non-terminals except for the terminals. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct the parse tree starting with the string and see if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t8 t35 t79 t3 t73 t64 t22 t56 t69 t35 t42 t27 t37 t43 t80 t23 t53 t8 t37.\n\nSo I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT4. So the string will start with some combination of symbols from NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut the first token is t8. So let's see which of NT0 or NT4 can produce t8. Wait, NT0 is part of S's production. NT0 is either NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7. NT6 can produce, for example, 't8' as in NT6->'t83' or maybe through other productions. Wait, let me verify:\n\nWait, looking for NT0 productions: NT0-> NT9 NT7, or NT0-> NT6 NT7, etc. Hmm, I think it's getting complicated. Maybe I should check which non-terminals can produce each token in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree step by step, starting with the entire string and applying the grammar rules in reverse, trying to split the string into sections that correspond to each production.\n\nLet's consider the string as a sequence and see how it can be split. The string is:\n\nt8 t35 t79 t3 t73 t64 t22 t56 t69 t35 t42 t27 t37 t43 t80 t23 t53 t8 t37\n\nI need to split this string into chunks that correspond to the right-hand sides of the productions.\n\nThe first step is to see which productions could have been used to get the first token, which is t8. Let's look at the grammar for any production that can produce t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I think NT8 can produce 't8' as in NT8->NT5 NT3, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, in the rules provided, I see NT8->'t83' and other terminals, but not t8. Maybe another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's list all the productions and see where terminals appear.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT3->t72, t70, etc.\n- NT5->t47, etc.\n- NT8->t83, t56, etc.\n- NT4->t32, t27, etc.\n- NT7->t13, t54, etc.\n- NT6->t83, t43, etc.\n- And others produce terminals like NT2->t7, etc.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding the structure. Maybe the grammar allows for terminals to be written directly as a single token. For example, a production like A-> B Z, where B is 't8' and Z is another non-terminal, or A-> 't8' could exist, but I don't see such a production in the given rules. Wait, looking through the rules, I don't see any production that ends directly with a single terminal. Therefore, each terminal in the input string must be part of a production that breaks it down into two non-terminals.\n\nBut that seems complicated because the string consists of two-letter tokens, which implies that each token is a non-terminal that can be expanded step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that 't8' is a terminal that is directly generated by a non-terminal that has a production like NT8->'t8' NTsomething, but I don't see that in the given grammar. Let me check the given productions again.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT8->'t83' (a non-terminal), and I don't see a production that ends with 't8'. Wait, in the grammar, the non-terminals are all two-symbol, like NT8, NT6, etc., but perhaps they can produce single terminals through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the string is made up of abbreviations like 't8' that correspond to a single terminal symbol. So each token in the string is a single character, but in the grammar, perhaps.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting stuck because the grammar seems a bit complex, and I'm not 100% sure how the non-terminals expand into terminals. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol S, which expands to NT0 and NT4. So the string starts with NT0 and NT4. The first token is 't8', which must come from NT0 or NT4.

The grammar provided looks like it's in CNF, with all left-hand sides being a single non-terminal and right-hand sides being either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of all terminals, so each token in the string must be derived directly from a production rule. That means for each token, there's a production that generates it, probably without any intermediate steps because the left-hand sides of the productions only generate terminals or two non-terminals. But since this is a context-free grammar, it's about how non-terminals can be expanded.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I think the starting symbol is S, as it's the first rule.

So each 't' in the string must correspond to a direct production of a non-terminal that expands to that terminal.\n\nSo the idea is that each 't... token is the result of a production where the non-terminal on the left directly goes to that 't...'.\n\nFrom the grammar, I can see rules like:\n\nNT2 -> 't7' etc. So for each 't...', I can find which NT (non-terminal) can produce it.\n\nSo for example, t67: Let's find what NT67 is. Wait, the grammar has NT6 -> 't83'. Wait, no, the grammar seems to have NTs with numbers like NT0, NT1, etc. Each seems to map to certain 't' tokens.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I notice a lot of rules where NTs go to a terminal and another NT.

But in that case, the string would have to be derived by expanding S through NTs, each producing other NTs or terminals.\n\nBut the string has all terminals, so each token must be directly generated by a production rule.\n\nWait, perhaps each t... is a terminal, meaning that the NTs in the productions that generate them must have a production that goes directly to that t.\n\nSo, for example, let's see if t67 is a terminal in any rule:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules starting with NT6:\n\nNT6 -> 't83',\n\nNT6 -> 't77',\n\nNT6 -> 't43',\n\nNT6 -> 't61',\n\nAlso, NT2 -> 't7', so perhaps that's where t7 comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the rules. The rules are given as NTx -> NTy Nz or NTx -> a single terminal.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that in the list of rules, each rule is given, but perhaps some are repeated.\n\nWait, in the list, I see:\n\nFor example,\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\n\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\n\nEtc.\n\nSo that's multiple rules. But I don't see any production that leads to t67.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t67.

The terminals in the grammar are mostly 't' followed by numbers, like 't72', 't56', etc. Each of these represents a single character in the string we need to check.\n\nLooking at the string, it consists of these terminals: t72, t56, t84, t67, t72, t10, t47, t28, t35, t31, t8, t60, t84, t56, t53, t39, t56, t47, t28, t77. Each is separated by a space, so each should correspond to a production in the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, the leftmost derivation path should produce the entire string. So I can probably start from the start symbol S and see if a leftmost derivation can exactly match the string.\n\nLooking at the start symbol: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols of the string should be the terminal expansions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two are t72 and t56. So I'll check what NT0 and NT4 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0 has several productions. Let me look them up:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 | NT9 NT7 | NT9 NT0 | NT2 NT9 | NT5 NT5 | NT5 NT7 | NT4 NT0 | NT7 NT7 | NT6 NT0 | NT5 NT5 (wait, are there more?)\n\nWait, compiling all NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0 (this is recursive)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 ... but NT4 isn't directly in NT0, wait, I might have confused. Wait, the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so NT0 and NT4 each need to produce some terminals.\n\nBut in the string, after t72 (which is NT0's expansion?), the next is t56, which should be NT4's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 other options as well, but each product is two non-terminals.\n\nSo, t56 is the expansion of NT4. So, which production of NT4 produces t56? Let's check.\n\nThe productions of NT4 are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n- ... Hmm, checking the NT4 entries in the grammar:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, NT4 has several productions ending with 't' numbers. For example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 t32, but wait, that's probably a terminal production. Wait no, let's look carefully.\n\nWait, the grammar entries for NT4 are:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT4\n- NT4 \u2192 NT27 (since NT4 \u2192 t27, as per the given productions: \"NT4 -> t27\" and others, but in the grammar it's written as NT4 -> t32, which is perhaps a terminal? Wait, no, because in the grammar, NT4's are non-terminals, but in the given productions, I think some of them directly produce terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, under NT4, there's:\n\n- NT4 -> t32 (so that's a terminal production, outputting 't32')\n- And others like NT4 \u2192 t5, t8, etc. So perhaps in the grammar, NT4 can directly produce these terminals.\n\nSo, looking for 't56'\u2014is there a production that directly outputs t56? Checking the given grammar, looking for NT4's productions:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT4 -> t32\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT4 -> t27\n- NT4 -> t8\n- NT4 -> t3\n- NT4 -> t13\n- NT4 -> t28\n- NT4 -> t7\n- NT4 -> t2\n- NT4 -> t70\n- NT4 -> t62\n- NT4 -> t27 again\n- NT4 -> t51\n- NT4 -> t39\n- NT4 -> t28 again\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT4 -> t32 again\n- NT4 -> t7\n- NT4 -> t43\n- NT4 -> t56\n- NT4 -> t84\n- NT4 -> t9 (another)\n- NT3 -> t... wait, no, NT4's direct productions are listed as:\n\nLooking again:\n\nThe production lines starting with NT4 are:\n\nNT4 -> t5\nNT4 -> t32\nNT4 -> NT3 NT4\nNT4 -> NT6 NT0\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT0 NT5\nNT4 -> NT7 NT4\nNT4 -> NT27\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nWait, no, more accurately the lines in the grammar under NT4:\n\n- NT4 -> t32\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT4 -> t8\n- NT4 -> t3\n- NT4 -> t13\n- NT4 -> t28\n- NT4 -> t7\n- NT4 -> t2\n- NT4 -> t70\n- NT4 -> t62\n- NT4 -> t27\n- NT4 -> t51\n- NT4 -> t39\n- NT4 -> t28 again\n- NT4 -> t9\n- NT4 -> t32\n- NT4 -> t56\n- NT4 -> t84\n- NT4 -> t9 again\n- NT4 -> t43\n- NT4 -> t56 again\n- NT4 -> t84 again\n- NT4 -> t...\nWait, seems like multiple NT4 productions produce the same terminal. So, looking for 't56' in NT4:\n\nLooking through the NT4 productions under the grammar, I can see that NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 t56, right? Because in the grammar, there's \"NT4 -> t56\" and also \"NT4 -> t84\".\n\nSo in the given grammar, NT4 has a production that directly outputs t56. So for the second token in the string 't56', NT4 can directly produce it. So that would happen when the symbol NT4 is expanded into t56.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nSo the first expansion is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, where NT0 expands to t72 and NT4 expands to t56. So that's the first and second tokens.\n\nNow, the third token is t84. So, after t56 (NT4), what's the next step?\n\nWait, no: in the string, after t72 comes t56, then t84. So let's backtrack. So after NT0 and NT4, the string so far is t72, t56. Then comes t84.\n\nWait, but S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and in the derivation, the leftmost symbol is NT0. So we have to first expand NT0, then NT4.\n\nSo the initial leftmost symbol is NT0, which can produce several things. Let's consider which production of NT0 can produce the next symbols.\n\nAfter NT0 and NT4, the string is \"t72 t56 t84...\". So the expansion of NT0 is t72, then NT4 is t56, then the next is t84.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, let me correct myself. The string is \"t72 t56 t84 t67 t72 t10 t47 t28 t35 t31 t8 t60 t84 t56 t53 t39 t56 t47 t28 t77\""}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. This helps in some parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but I'm not sure if I need that here. Since the grammar is given with all rules in CNF, that's a good start.\n\nThe string starts with `t5` and ends with `t31`. I notice that a lot of these tokens are terminal symbols ending with numbers, but some of them might be non-terminals? Wait, looking back at the grammar, I see that the non-terminals are like NT0, NT1, etc., and the terminals are like 't5', 't47', etc. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol, meaning that the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nI think the process is to check if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions. The start symbol is S.\n\nLet's list the productions and terminals:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nNT0 and others have productions like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, etc.\n\nLooking at the string, it starts with `t5`, which is a terminal. So the derivation must begin with that. I need to see if there's a production that leads to starting with `t5`.\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules, I see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nAnd some others, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should list all NT0 productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5 again.\n\nWait, so NT0 can produce combinations that include NT5, NT6, NT7, NT9, etc. Now, looking at the string, the first part is t5, which could correspond to a non-terminal that can produce 't5', like NT5.\n\nLooking through the NT5 rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3\nWait, but do any NT5 rules produce 't5'? Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT5, are there any productions that end in 't5'? I see:\n\nLooking for any terminal like 't5' in NT5's productions. Oh, I see some 't' terms in the rules, but it's more about terminal symbols like NT5-> 't5'?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the symbols. The terminals at the end are like t5, t47, and so on. So in the grammar, I have:\n\nNT5 -> 't5' ?\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\nLooking for where NT5 goes to a terminal:\n\nLooking at:\n\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT5 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT3\nWait, but then I see other rules:\n\nWait, there's a rule NT5 -> NT6 NT7, wait no, I think that's NT6.\n\nWait, maybe I should look more carefully:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't47', etc.\n\nI see:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT6 -> 't83'\nNT8 -> 't11'\nNT4 -> 't84'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't32'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo each non-terminal can directly produce a 't' followed by some number. So each of these is a terminal symbol.\n\nThis means that in the string, each 'tX' is a terminal derived from a specific non-terminal. For example, t47 comes from NT5, t27 comes from NT5 as well.\n\nSo each 't' token corresponds to a non-terminal that can directly produce it. So the task is to see if the sequence of these non-terminals can be derived from S.\n\nSo, the string is a sequence of t's, each corresponding to a specific non-terminal. Let's map each 't' to the corresponding NT:\n\nt5: Looking for which NT \u2192 't5'. I see:\n\nLooking at all grammar rules, NT5 -> 't47', but I don't see t5 anywhere. Wait, did I miss it? Let me check all the rules again. Oh, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't5' ?\n\nWait, no, in the rules, for example:\n\nWait, yes! Wait, let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't5'. Looking:\n\nLooking through all rules, for example:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't47' (so t47 comes from NT5)\nNT0 \u2192 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33' (so t33 is from NT5)\nWait, and where does t5 come from? Did I miss it?\n\nWait, looking at the last rules:\n\nLooking for NT5 \u2192 't5'?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me list which NT produce which 't's:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47' and 't33'\n- NT4 \u2192 't37', 't84', 't32'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11', 't5'\nWait, wait! I see NT8 \u2192 't5', so 't5' comes from NT8.\n\nYes, here's where:\n\nLooking for 't5', it's directly from NT8, as NT8 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nt47: comes from NT5\n\nt27 comes from NT5 (since NT5 can produce 't33' and 't3' etc. Wait, no, looking at NT5's rules:\n\nWait, in the NT5 rules, I don't see 't27'. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because I think I'm missing something. Let me check:\n\nIn the NT5 rules:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6\nNT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3\nWait, none of these are 't27'. Wait, but in the given string, there's a t27. Where does t27 come from?\n\nWait, maybe it's from NT2. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT2 rules:\n\nLooking at NT2:\n\nNT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6\nNT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, so NT2 can produce 't7' directly, but I don't see a rule that produces 't27' directly. So perhaps t27 comes from NT27, but since the grammar doesn't go that deep, maybe it's through some other way.\n\nWait, but the grammar is in CNF, so all non-terminals have two symbols on the right. So 't27' can be derived only if the non-terminal producing it has two NT symbols, but 't27' is a terminal, so that's only possible if the production rule leads directly to 't27'.\n\nWait, that's conflicting because in CNF, all products are two non-terminals, except the start symbol. So perhaps the 't's are only the result of some non-terminals being expanded.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Since all the given rules have only two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol S, the 't's can only be directly produced by the start symbol if S can produce a terminal directly, but in the given grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which are non-terminals, so S can't directly produce a terminal. Therefore, the 't's in the string must be produced via some non-terminals, so each 't' must come from a chain of productions expanding into that terminals.\n\nSo, the string is `t5 t47 t27 t27 t12 t61 t79 t73 t3 t44 t21 t60 t51 t84 t53 t54 t61 t5 t26 t31`.\n\nEach token is a 't' followed by a number.

{"custom_id":"request-405","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t37 t37 t31 t7 t12 t32 t43 t7 t80 t2 t62 t40 t51 t8 t53 t15 t57 t64 t32 t15 t11`. \n\nFirst, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. Each of these non-terminals further breaks down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI notice that the string consists of only terminal symbols, none of the non-terminals (like NT0, NT1, etc.), so each token in the string must correspond to a production that directly gives that terminal.\n\nLet me list out the string parts to see if they match any terminals in the grammar:\n\nt37, t37, t31, t7, t12, t32, t43, t7, t80, t2, t62, t40, t51, t8, t53, t15, t57, t64, t32, t15, t11.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that certain symbols like NT3, NT5, etc., produce specific terminals. For example, NT3 is defined in multiple places, sometimes producing 't72', 't76', etc.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string from the start symbol S, which is NT0 NT4. So the first step is to have NT0 and NT4. Let's see if the string starts correctly.\n\nThe first part is t37 t37. So the first part is t37. Looking at the productions from NT3 and NT4:\n\nNT3 can produce t72, t54, t53, etc. Wait, but in the grammar, NT4 -> t32, t84, etc. Wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, the grammar productions are all in the form of NTx -> NTy NTz. The only terminals are those that have 't' followed by a number. So each production rules for non-terminals define how they produce strings.\n\nI think I need to build a parse tree starting with S = NT0 NT4.\n\nWait, but the string is a sequence of t... so I need to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar step by step.\n\nMaybe it's easier to work backwards, trying to see if the string can be split into parts that match each production step.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to match the string by starting at S and seeing if each step produces tokens in the string.\n\nWait, the grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT4. So the first step is to split into NT0 and NT4. So the string must start with something that can be generated by NT0 and something by NT4, concatenated. So the string starts with two t... tokens. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the string, the first part is t37 t37 t31 t7 t12 t32 t43 t7 t80 t2 t62 t40 t51 t8 t53 t15 t57 t64 t32 t15 t11.\n\nWait, the first two are t37, which might come from NT3 or other NTs.\n\nLet me check the productions. For example, NT3 can produce t72, t54, etc. Wait, but t37 is different. Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, are there any productions that produce t37 directly? I don't see any. Wait, perhaps t37 is produced by a non-terminal. Let me check each production rule.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 -> t23\n\nNT3 -> t72, t76, etc.\n\nNT7 -> t13, t43, etc.\n\nWait, so t37 isn't directly any of the terminals. Or is it? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't37' directly. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the grammar uses a different structure. Maybe the left-hand side symbols don't directly produce 't37' but are part of a chain leading to it.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to follow the production chain down from NT0 and NT4 to see if they can generate the required string tokens.\n\nLet me start with S->NT0 NT4. So the string starts with whatever NT0 produces followed by NT4.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't37'. So let's see if NT0 can produce 't37'.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT9\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT2\n\nWait, NT0 is split into two non-terminals. So to get 't37', one of the non-terminals must produce it.\n\nLooking at each production of NT0, do any of them have a terminal as a child, which could be 't37'?\n\nWait, but wait, the grammar is in CNF, so all productions are A -> BC, and only the base symbols are terminals. So 't37' is a terminal, which must be produced directly by some non-terminal. But looking through the grammar, is any non-terminal directly producing 't37'?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, for example:\n\nNT3 -> t72\n\nWait, so is 't37' produced by any non-terminal? Let me check all the NT productions to see if any produce t37 directly.\n\nLooking through all the NT productions, I don't see any production that produces 't37'. That's a problem because the string starts with 't37', but if NT0 and NT4 can't produce it, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe I missed it. Let me recheck each production rule.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT7 -> t13\n\nNT3 -> t72, etc.\n\nNT5 -> t47\n\nNT0 -> t23\n\nLooking through each production, I don't see 't37' being produced directly. So that would mean the string cannot be generated because the starting symbols can't produce the first token.\n\nWait, but maybe the non-terminals can chain to produce 't37'. For example, if NT0 can produce a string that starts with 't37'. But in the grammar, each production of NT0 splits into two non-terminals, so NT0 is split into two parts, each of which is another non-terminal.\n\nSo, if the first part is, say, NT6, which then could produce another non-terminal, but does any production of NT6 produce a terminal? Let's see:\n\nNT6's productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\n\nNT6 -> NT6 NT7\n\nWait, so NT6 can't produce a terminal directly; it's a two-step process. So for instance, if the first 't37' is from NT6, but none of the productions of NT6 produce a terminal. So that's impossible.\n\nSame goes for the other productions. Each NT in the start or in the string seems to only split further, not produce terminals. Which implies that the initial string is only made up of these non-terminals, which are then combined. But the given string is entirely terminal symbols, which suggests that the entire string must be derived through splitting all the way down.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so when you expand S, it's S -> NT0 NT4, each of which must further expand into two non-terminals. This continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the entire string should be a series of terminal symbols resulting from such expansions.\n\nSo in this case, the string consists of 21 tokens. Let me count: 21, yes.\n\nSo each of these must result from a terminal symbol.\n\nTherefore, the initial step is S, which is NT0 NT4. So the first step would be that the string starts with NT0's expansion, then NT4's.\n\nEach of those non-terminals produces two non-terminals, which in turn produce two non-terminals each, and so on, until we end up with all terminals.\n\nSo perhaps I should model this as a series of splits, trying to match the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can parse the string backward, starting from the end and seeing if it can be reduced by the grammar.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to map the string in reverse, checking if each terminal can be part of a production.\n\nWait, but this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's try to see if each token in the string can be matched as a terminal produced by some non-terminal.\n\nAs I saw before, the first token is 't37', and none of the NT productions seem to produce 't37' directly. Unless I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check each NT again more carefully.\n\nLooking through the NT productions:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-400","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is `t84 t5 t11 t35 t39 t67 t20 t73 t24 t11 t70 t31 t56 t62 t22 t64 t67 t3 t70 t26 t7`. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what a grammar in CNF looks like. CNF has two main characteristics: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can be directly rewritten as a terminal string. Additionally, there are no \u03b5-productions, meaning no non-terminal can produce the empty string. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I notice several rules. For instance, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the start symbol S initially breaks into NT0 and NT4. \n\nNext, I should consider the string and see how it could be broken down into these non-terminals. The string starts with 't84', so I'll look for production rules that produce 't84'. Scanning through, I see NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT2 and NT7 \u2192 NT13, but I don't see 't84' directly. Wait, maybe I need to look again.\n\nWait, in the given rules, I see NT3 \u2192 't72' and NT8 \u2192 't5' and others. Let me check all the terminal productions. Hmm, 't84' appears in several production rules as a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 't37' and NT8 \u2192 't5' etc. Wait, no, 't84' is first in my string. Let me check if any non-terminal directly produces 't84'. Scanning through the rules: there's NT4 \u2192 't84', which is one of the rules (NT4 -> t37 and others). Wait, no, looking again, I think NT4 \u2192 't9' or 't5' or 't84'\u2014yes, I see that NT4 \u2192 't84' in the rules provided. So, that's a rule I can use.\n\nSo, the first token 't84' must come from NT4. Let's note that. So, the string starts with NT4, which splits into two parts. Now, NT4 has several productions. Looking at the rules, NT4 can produce 't37', 't5', 't28', 't8', 't27', 't32', 't9', 't7', 't43', etc. So 't84' must come from NT4's rule. Looking at the rules, I see NT4 -> 't84' is indeed one of the productions. So, the first term t84 comes from NT4.\n\nNow, according to the structure, NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT2. So, after t84, the next terms should be reachable from NT0 and NT2. Let's see what the next tokens are: after t84, we have t5, t11, etc.\n\nWait, the string is a flat list of tokens. So, the next token after t84 should be split into two parts, meaning the leftmost non-terminal(s) after t84.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each production produces exactly two non-terminals. So, the initial split of S is into two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4. When NT4 is resolved, it's into two non-terminals, say A and B. Then, each of A and B can split into two non-terminals, recursively, until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut the string is a list of terminals, so we need to see if each non-terminal in the derivation can produce the correct sequence of terminal symbols.\n\nSo, let's consider the string. The whole string needs to form a single derivation starting from S.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, t84 is produced by NT4, which is the second part of S. Now, I need to check how the rest of the string unfolds.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a top-down parsing approach, starting from S and trying to derive the string step by step, matching each terminal token accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is long, maybe it's a leftmost derivation. Let me think.\n\nSo, starting with S, which produces NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe first symbol is t84, which comes from NT4, which is the second part. So, the first token in the string is part of the second non-terminal, so perhaps in the leftmost derivation, after S \u2192 NT0 NT4, we first expand NT0, and then NT4. So, after t84 is produced by NT4, what's left are the other tokens starting from the first, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the reverse approach: look at the string and see if it can be built by the grammar. Each symbol in the string must be a terminal that is produced by the non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to see each step as the leftmost derivation.\n\nLet me try this step by step.\n\nThe string is: t84 t5 t11 t35 t39 t67 t20 t73 t24 t11 t70 t31 t56 t62 t22 t64 t67 t3 t70 t26 t7.\n\nWe'll consider the string as a list, so the first element is t84, followed by t5, etc.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t84, which is NT4's production. So, the initial split after S is NT0 (which is the first part) and NT4 (which is the second part, but in the string, the first symbol is t84, which is from NT4). So, we need to process after the first symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to split the string into possible segments that each non-terminal could produce.\n\nBut that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can construct a parse tree bottom-up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should check if each symbol in the string can be explained by the terminals in the grammar, considering their origin.\n\nWait, let's note all the terminal symbols in the string to make sure they're covered by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the terminals are:\n\nt84, t5, t11, t35, t39, t67, t20, t73, t24, t11, t70, t31, t56, t62, t22, t64, t67, t3, t70, t26, t7.\n\nNow, I can check which non-terminals can produce these terminals.\n\nIn the grammar, for each terminal mentioned, there exists a production rule. For example:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't84' (one rule)\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' (another)\n- NT4 \u2192 't9', 't7', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't13', etc.\n\nSo, all the terminals in the string must correspond to the productions of non-terminals.\n\nNow, let's consider if each terminal can be produced by a non-terminal.\n\nCheck each token:\n\n1. t84: Yes, NT4 \u2192 t84\n2. t5: NT5 \u2192 't5' (wait, in the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 't5' once, right? Looking: yes, NT5 -> 't5' is one of the rules.\n3. t11: Looking for where t11 comes from. Maybe NT11 is a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, all the non-terminals are written as NT followed by a number, e.g., NT0, NT1, etc. So, no NT11; perhaps it's from a parent non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps each step needs to be broken down.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to construct a parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to model the string step by step.\n\nWe have the string: t84, t5, t11, t35, t39, t67, t20, t73, t24, t11, t70, t31, t56, t62, t22, t64, t67, t3, t70, t26, t7.\n\nStarting from S, which produces NT0 and NT4.\n\n- The first symbol in the string is t84, which must be a terminal.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, let's look at the string: t32 t44 t3 t17 t23 t80 t83 t72 t9 t56 t52 t62 t70 t37 t2 t61 t33 t39 t70 t33 t40 t3.\n\nSo, each token in the string is a symbol from the grammar, except maybe the 't's followed by numbers. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has productions where terminals are things like 't32', 't44', etc. So each token in the string is a terminal symbol. That means each token must be produced by a production that ends with that terminal.\n\nThe grammar's non-terminals are S, NT0, NT1 to NT9, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9. Wait, in the initial grammar, it's only S and NT followed by numbers? So all non-terminals are either S or NT followed by a digit.\n\nLooking at the string, all tokens are 't' followed by two digits, and also some like 't7', but in the string, they are all two digits. Wait, the string given is: t32 t44 t3 t17 t23 t80 t83 t72 t9 t56 t52 t62 t70 t37 t2 t61 t33 t39 t70 t33 t40 t3.\n\nWait a second, some tokens end with a single digit, like 't9', 't2', etc. But the grammar's terminals are all two-digit strings like 't32', 't44', etc. So that's a problem. Because in the grammar, none of the productions end with a single 't' followed by one digit. All the terminals in the grammar are two digits, except maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar provided. The grammar has various productions ending with 't' followed by a number, but I think all the terminals are two-digit sequences. For example, NT2 \u2192 't7'. Wait no, let me scan through:\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are 't32', 't44', etc. So the productions that produce terminals are:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, no, checking the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nBut wait, in the given grammar, it's written as 't7'? Or is that with a number after 't'?\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, later, I see NT2 \u2192 't7' \u2014 but wait, in the grammar, is that 't7' or 't2'? Let me check the full grammar provided.\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a list, and some of the productions end with 't' followed by numbers. For example:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nWait, no: looking at the grammar, I think I made a mistake.

The user's grammar has:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\n\nAnd other lines like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'\n\nNT5 \u2192 't47'\n\nSo, some terminals are single 't' followed by numbers, like 't7', 't23', etc. So in the grammar, the terminals are strings like 't7', 't23', 't32', etc. So in the string we're evaluating, each token is either one of these two-character 't' followed by a number.\n\nSo the given string has tokens like t32, t44, t3, t17, etc. Wait, wait: t3 is one 't' followed by '3', but in the grammar, the terminals are all two-digit, like 't32', 't44', etc. So is t3 a terminal? Or is it a non-terminal?\n\nLooking back, the grammar has rules where NT3 can produce 't72', which is a two-character terminal. But are there any rules that produce a single-character terminal? For example, is there a rule that produces 't' alone?\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, I don't see any production that ends with a single 't' followed by a digit or letter. For example, I don't see a production like NT2 \u2192 't', or NT3 \u2192 't'. So, all terminals in the grammar are two-character strings like 't3', 't7', 't23', etc.\n\nThis means that any occurrence of a single 't' followed by a number in the string would be invalid because it's not a terminal in the grammar. For example, 't3' in the string would require that there's a production for NT3 that produces 't3', but I don't see such a production. The closest is NT3 \u2192 't72', but that's two digits.\n\nTherefore, any string containing a single 't' followed by a number cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: t32 t44 t3 t17 t23 t80 t83 t72 t9 t56 t52 t62 t70 t37 t2 t61 t33 t39 t70 t33 t40 t3.\n\nIn this string, there are a few tokens that are single 't' followed by a number: t3, t2, t3, t37, t2, t3.\n\nFor example, 't3' is a problem because if NT3 \u2192 't', it's not a production rule in the grammar.

I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what CNF is. CNF is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals (variables) and a is a terminal symbol. This helps simplify parsing and makes certain algorithms more efficient because each production strictly has two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the right.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules are of the form NT followed by non-terminals. Some of them are terminal symbols, like NT2 \u2192 't7', which means that 't7' is a terminal that directly appears in the string.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t63 t28 t23 t22 t69 t83 t53 t42 t7 t64 t22 t47 t8 t70 t20 t7 t33 t11 t26 t76 t42 t17`.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar rules.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the derivation starts with NT0 and NT4, which are both non-terminals. Each of these can be expanded into other non-terminals, which eventually should lead to terminal symbols that match the string.\n\nThe string has 21 tokens, so the derivation would have to produce exactly 21 symbols. Since S starts with two non-terminals, each expansion should lead towards terminal symbols.\n\nI think a good approach is to try to parse the string from the start by considering the grammar's productions. Since it's CNF, the parse tree should be a binary tree where each internal node has exactly two children.\n\nBut manually doing this for a 21-symbol string seems complex. Maybe I can look for patterns or see if any rules produce the terminal symbols present in the string.\n\nLooking at the string tokens, I notice that some are terminals like t63, t28, etc. Now, looking at the grammar rules, many of them lead to terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't7', NT3 \u2192 't72', and others.\n\nI think I should start by seeing if the first token in the string, 't63', can come from a non-terminal in the grammar. Looking at the rules, I don't see an immediate rule that directly produces 't63'. Looking through, most terminals are things like 't7', 't8', 't5', etc., so I don't see 't63' being a direct production. That might be a problem because if 't63' can't be derived directly, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me check all the rules for terminals. Scrolling through, I see rules like NT6 \u2192 't83', NT4 \u2192 't37', but nothing like 't63'. Hmm, so 't63' is a terminal that's not directly produced by any single rule in the grammar. \n\nIf that's the case, then the string contains a symbol that the grammar can't produce, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.

CNF has productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals or two terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that most of the rules are production rules for non-terminals leading to other rules, except some like NT2 \u2192 't7', NT9 \u2192 't60', etc. These are the terminal productions that will appear in the string.\n\nThe given string consists of a sequence of terminals, so the approach is to parse the string from the beginning by matching the start symbol S and using the productions to derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. From S's productions, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first step is to produce NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2 or other terms, and eventually some of these lead to terminals like 't32', 't27', etc. So I need to find a derivation path where combining NT0 and NT4 can generate the first few 't's.\n\nBut manually parsing a 23-token string with this grammar would be time-consuming. However, maybe I can look for patterns or check if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t3, then t81, t3, t5, t27, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals appear multiple times. Let's see for 't3':\n- NT3 \u2192 't72' or other rules leading to t3, perhaps via NT7 \u2192 t43 or other pathways.\n\nWait, maybe I can check individually:\n\n't3': Where does 't3' come from?\nLooking at the rules, NT3 has several productions, one of which is NT3 \u2192 't72'. But I'm looking for 't3', so maybe other pathways. Wait, wait, wait, in the rules, NT3 has several productions ending with terms. Let me check all NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n\nWait, I see that NT3 can also be produced as a combination of NT4 and NT6, among others. But I don't see a production that directly leads to 't3' except maybe through another non-terminal? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking. Let me scan the rules again for NT3:\n\nYes, looking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT7 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT3 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n\nBut none of these directly give 't3' except probably through other non-terminals. Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting, and perhaps 't3' comes from elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps 't3' is a dead end, meaning it can't be derived, implying the string isn't generated.\n\nWait, let me think again. For 't3' to appear, there must be a production that emits 't3'. But looking at the provided grammar, do any NT's directly produce 't3'? For instance, looking through each rule's terminal options:\n\nLooking for 't3', I see NT5 \u2192 't3' (since NT5 is a non-terminal, but in the rules, some NT5 productions are 't3' like NT5 \u2192 't3' via NT5 \u2192 't62' no, wait, looking at the rules:\n\nWait, in the rules, I see NT5 has several productions:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't47' (I think that's a typo, but maybe 't47' is a terminal).\nWait, let's list all the NT5 productions:\n\nLooking at NT5:\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT6\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT5 \u2192 NT0 NT5\n- NT5 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 other stuff\n- Wait, I see that NT5 has production NT5 \u2192 't3'? Wait, in the rules, I see \"NT5 -> 't47'\", but looking again:\n\nIn the provided rules for NT5, one is NT5 \u2192 't3' is not present. Let me verify.\n\nWait, the rules for NT5 are:\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT5\nNT5 -> NT5 NT6\nNT5 -> NT3 NT9\nNT5 -> NT6 NT7\nNT5 -> NT6 NT3\nNT5 -> NT7 NT3\nNT5 -> NT9 NT6\nNT5 -> NT0 NT5\nNT5 -> NT4 NT3\nNT5 -> NT3 NT7\nNT5 -> NT7 NT3\n... and I don't see any direct production of 't3' from NT5. Instead, some of the non-terminals (like NT0, NT2, etc.) have productions that lead to terminals.\n\nBut looking back, NT3 \u2192 't72', but we need 't3'. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait! Let me check the grammar again. I see that in the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a NT3 production leading to 't3' via another path.\n\nWait, let's look again. In the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for 't3' in terminal options:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't13'?\nWait, maybe not. Let's check for 't3':\n\nLooking through, I see NT3 \u2192 't72' and 't31', but nothing directly giving 't3'. Maybe I'm wrong and 't3' isn't directly produced by any NT. Alternatively, perhaps 't3' can be derived via some combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains a 't3' that can't be generated, meaning the overall answer is 'No'.\n\nBut how? Let's take the string's first token: 't3'.\n\nLooking for a production that can generate 't3'. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and another symbol.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, do any of the NTs directly produce 't3'? Or can 't3' be produced via a series of steps from an NT?\n\nLooking at all the NT rules:\n\nLooking for where 't3' can appear as a terminal production. The only NT that can directly emit a terminal string (i.e., has a production ending in a terminal) is NT9, which emits 't57', 't44', etc.\n\nWait, NT2 can produce 't7', which is in the string. Similarly, NT4 can produce 't32', 't27', etc.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the provided grammar. In the grammar, some NTs produce a single terminal, like:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23' (among others)\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nNT5 \u2192 't10' etc.\n\nBut 't3' is not directly emitted by any of these. However, looking further, NT3 can be produced via NT7 via NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, and so on. But does any path lead to 't3' as a terminal?\n\nWait, NT3 can be derived from other non-terminals. For example, NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3, so NT3 can branch into NT5 and NT8 products.\n\nWait, but without any direct or indirect production of 't3' as a terminal, maybe the string cannot be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't3' comes from another NT like NT5 via some productions. Let me see: Looking at NT5 \u2192 't3'?

Since the grammar is already in CNF, which simplifies parsing, I'll approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of the grammar. All productions are binary (A \u2192 BC, etc.), and the start symbol is S. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers or letters (like NT7, NT0, etc.), and the terminals are specific 't' followed by numbers (like t76, t40, etc.), plus NT3 and NT2 expanding to some other terminals.\n\nThe goal is to parse the given string into the grammar. Parsing can be done with either top-down (like CYK or recursive descent) or bottom-up methods. Since the grammar is in CNF, recursive descent with appropriate lookahead might work, but considering the complexity, perhaps a top-down parser approach manually would be better here.\n\nLet me list all the productions and terminals for clarity.\n\nNon-terminals:\nNT0, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9\n\nTerminals and their corresponding non-terminals in the productions:\n- t76: NT3\n- t40: NT4\n- t73: NT5\n- t39: NT5\n- t21: NT8\n- t63: NT2\n- t27: NT9\n- t79: NT9\n- t60: NT6\n- t43: NT7\n- t56: NT4\n- t11: NT6\n- t7: NT2\n- t44: NT7\n- t77: NT6\n- t33: NT0\n- t52: NT8\n- t37: NT3\n- t64: NT8\n- t60: NT6\n- t60: NT6\n- t23: NT0\n- t56: NT4\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, some of these are already terminals. For example:\n- NT3 \u2192 t76, t70, t73, etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 t23, t28, etc.\n\nWait, actually, when I look at the productions, some NT's directly produce terminal symbols. For example, NT3 can produce t76, t70, t73, etc. Similarly, NT0 can produce t23, t28, etc.\n\nSo first, I should note all the possible ways each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nFor example:\n- t76 comes from NT3\n- t40 comes from NT4 \u2192 t43, t5, etc., but wait, looking at the grammar, NT4 can produce NT4 NT3 and other combinations eventually leading to terminals. Wait, but in the given grammar, NT4 has multiple productions involving other non-terminals. Wait, no, NT4's productions are:\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\n\nWait, that's a bit complex. So to get t40, which is NT4, I need to see if NT4 can derive it. Wait, no, all the productions of NT4 produce other non-terminals, except when they eventually lead to terminals via other expanding non-terminals.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Each NT production either becomes two NT's or a terminal. For example, NT4 \u2192 t43, or more specifically, looking at the grammar:\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT4 has several productions, none of which are direct terminals except for NT4 \u2192 t37, perhaps? Wait, let me check each grammar rule:\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\nNT7 \u2192 NT13 (t13?), but actually, the last lines have:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'  (t72)\n\nNT5 \u2192 't47'\n\nNT7 \u2192 't13'\n\nWait, I need to clarify which NT productions lead to which terminals. Let's go through each NT and see which terminals they can produce directly.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar, every production that ends with NT... \u2192 something that's a terminal, like NT3 \u2192 t76, NT0 \u2192 t23, etc.\n\nSo, for each NT, list all the terminal symbols they can produce.\n\n- NT3: t76, t70, t73, t37, t39, t53, t57, t72, t76 again, t70, t73, etc. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's extract each NT's terminal productions:\n\nLooking through all the rules, NT3 has several rules ending with 't':\n\n- NT3 -> t76\n- NT3 -> t70\n- NT3 -> t73\n- NT3 -> t53\n- NT3 -> t39\n- NT3 -> t31\n- NT3 -> t37\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, instead of manually listing each, perhaps it's better to note that each NT can produce a set of terminals. For example, NT3 produces t76, t70, t73, etc., each from a specific production rule.\n\nSimilarly, each NT has certain terminal symbols they can produce.\n\nNow, the given string is a sequence of these terminals:\n\nt76, t40, t73, t39, t21, t63, t27, t79, t60, t43, t56, t11, t7, t44, t77, t33, t52, t37, t64, t60, t60, t23, t56.\n\nI need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which is NT0 NT4. So the string should start with a parse where S expands into NT0 NT4, and each of these non-terminals can generate their respective parts.\n\nLet me attempt to split the string into two parts: the part generated by NT0 and the part generated by NT4.\n\nThe entire string is:\n\nt76 t40 t73 t39 t21 t63 t27 t79 t60 t43 t56 t11 t7 t44 t77 t33 t52 t37 t64 t60 t60 t23 t56.\n\nSuppose NT0 generates the prefix, and NT4 generates the suffix. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex split, but for simplicity, let's try this initial split.\n\nBut first, let's check each part.\n\nNT0's productions can lead to which terminals:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has several rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT0\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nND0 -> NT6 NT6\nNT0 -> NT9 NT6\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see all NT0's productions and the terminals they can produce.\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT0 has the following direct terminal productions:\n\nLooking at each rule for NT0:\n\n1.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the left side or a terminal symbol on the left.\n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar rules to see the production rules. The terminals are marked with arrows pointing to strings like 't33', 't54', etc., and the non-terminals are all other symbols on the left side of the rules. Since the string consists of all terminal symbols, I need to check if the grammar can derive this string.\n\nI think a good approach is to parse the string using the grammar. Since it's in CNF, the leftmost derivation method might be systematic. Each step in the derivation replaces the leftmost non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. But since the string is a sequence of terminals, each step must generate a terminal followed by non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by listing the string: t33 t54 t72 t8 t64 t70 t81 t27 t69 t10 t70 t64 t56 t39 t9 t77 t60 t3 t47 t8 t64 t73 t14 t40\n\nI notice the first symbol is t33. Looking at the grammar, where can t33 come from? Let's check the productions for NT3. I seeNT3->t53, NT3->t31, NT0->t33. Oh, wait, there's also NT0->t33. So if the first non-terminal is NT0, it can produce t33. That seems possible.\n\nSo the first part is NT0 -> t33. Now, moving on to the next symbol, t54. Let's see if t54 is in any production. Looking through the NT54... Wait, I see NT4 -> t32, but that's for NT4. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me scan the grammar again for NT54. Hmm, not directly seeing it. Maybe I need to backtrack because I might be missing a production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should build a parse tree. Let me try to do a leftmost derivation. Starting with S, which is the start symbol.\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nSo, first, I need to expand NT0 and NT4. Let's see what NT0 can become. From the grammar, NT0 has multiple productions. One of them is NT0 -> t62, but earlier we used NT0 -> t33. So perhaps I confused the first step. Let me correct that.\n\nIn the first step, S -> NT0 NT4. If we choose NT0 -> t33, then the first part becomes t33. Now, NT4 can produce various things. Let me see the NT4 productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 can produce t37, t5, t8, t9, t32, etc. I'm looking for what would produce t54. Hmm, I don't see a direct production for t54 in the NT4 rules. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for NT54. If I don't see it, maybe it's a derived symbol. Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently. Let me check each production step by step.\n\nStarting with S, we have NT0 and NT4. Let's pick NT0's production that gives t33: NT0->t33. Then NT4 needs to produce t54. Let's look at NT4's rules. Scanning the list, I see NT4->t37, NT4->t5, NT4->t32, NT4->t8 (but doesn't have a t54). Wait, is there a rule for NT4 that produces t54? I don't see it. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let me scan the grammar again. I see NT4->t8, but nowhere does it produce t54. If that's the case, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe the first non-terminal isn't NT0. Let's try NT4 producing t54. But I don't see NT4->t54. So that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion is wrong. Let's re-examine the start symbol. The start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So the first step is to substitute S into NT0 NT4. Now, let's look at the productions for NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, no, I think I got it wrong. In the first step, S expands to NT0 and NT4. Then each of those can be further expanded. So perhaps I should focus on the expansion of NT0 and NT4 to derive the first few symbols.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. Another approach is to try to match the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as needed. Let me start by looking at the string and trying to match it to the grammar.\n\nThe string starts with t33. Looking for production rules that produce t33. From the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> t33\n- NT7 -> t54? No, NT7 can produce t43, t13, etc.\n- Wait, looking at the NT3 rules: NT3->t53, NT3->t31, NT0->t33. So t33 comes from NT0.\n\nSo first, NT0 must produce t33. Then, the next symbol is t54, so after t33, the NT4 must produce a sequence that starts with t54. But looking at NT4's rules, I can't find any that directly produce t54. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the NT4 can produce other non-terminals that eventually lead to t54 through their productions. Let's look back at NT4's rules. NT4 is derived from the start as the first non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the NT4 productions: \n\n- NT4->t8 (no t54)\n- NT4->t37 (no)\n- NT4->t5 (no)\n- NT4->t32 (no)\n- NT4->t7 (no)\n- NT4->t14 (no)\n- Also, NT4->t47 (no)\n- etc. Wait, no, NT4->t37 and t5, but not t54.\n\nHmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the string doesn't start with t33. Let me check the string again: it starts with t33, t54, t72, t8, etc. So if the first symbol is t33, perhaps it's correct.\n\nBut then, what about t54 in the second position. Since NT4 can't produce t54 directly, maybe it's produced by a combination of rules.\n\nWait, perhaps NT4 is expanded into non-terminals that in turn produce the next symbols. Let me try to see what comes after t33 and then t54.\n\nLet me think about the possible expansions. Since after S -> NT0 NT4, if NT0 is expanded to t33, then NT4 must expand into a sequence that starts with t54 and then the rest of the string.\n\nBut NT4 doesn't produce t54 directly. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the first t33 isn't from NT0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string starts with another part of the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe the initial step is S->NT0 NT4, and NT0 produces something else that starts with t33. Let me check NT0's productions.\n\nNT0 has multiple rules: one of them is NT0->t62, but that's longer. The crucial ones are NT0->t33 and NT0->t74, maybe? Wait, looking at the list:\n\n- NT0->t23\n- NT0->t28\n- NT0->t35\n- NT0->t39\n- NT0->t40\n- NT0->t43\n- NT0->t56\n- NT0->t60\n- NT0->t67\n- etc.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that NT0->t33. So if I substitute that, then the second symbol, t54, must come from NT4.\n\nBut what can NT4 produce? Maybe through a chain of substitutions.\n\nLooking at the NT4 productions: one of them is NT4->t47. If I look for the next symbol being t54, is there a way for t47 or other non-terminals to chain together to get t54?\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think if there's another way. Maybe the string starts with another production.\n\nWait, let me take a different approach. Let me look for the production rules that"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The entire string is the concatenation of several 't' symbols with numbers. Since all these 't' symbols are terminals, I need to see if the grammar can produce each of these terminals.\n\nLooking at the productions, I notice that some are defined as terminals.

Looking through the productions, I don't see 't10' directly. Maybe it's derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces t10.

So in the string, t10 would be the result of NT5 -> 't10'.

Also, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except when the start symbol can derive a terminal directly. \n\nLooking at the grammar provided, it seems all productions are in CNF because each rule is a single non-terminal on the left, and the right side has exactly two nonTerminals or terminals. So each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nNow, the string has 26 tokens, all of which are two-digit numbers, and some are single characters, but all seem to correspond to the terminals in the grammar. For example, 't83' is a terminal, 't67' is another, and so on.\n\nThe approach I'll take is to see if I can parse the string step by step using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can apply the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for CNF grammars. But given the complexity of the grammar, it might be easier to manually check by finding a derivation path.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the presence of each input token in the grammar and see if a leftmost derivation or rightmost derivation could build up the string. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the string for any terminal that's a direct production. For example, 't83' appears in the grammar under NT8 \u2192 t83? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't27' (Wait, NT5 is already defined to produce 't27'? Or is it 't27' as another rule?)\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't32'\n... and so on.\n\nWait, looking at NT3:\n\nNT3 has multiple productions:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't27' (Wait, that's under NT5, not NT3. Wait, no: looking at the grammar, the line is NT5 -> 't27'. So in NT5, one of the productions is 't27'.\n\nSimilarly, NT7: NT7 -> 't13'\nNT9: NT9 -> 't43'\nNT3 also has:\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT3 -> 't76'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT3 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't10'\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, in the string, the first token is 't83', which I need to check if any rule produces 't83'. Looking through the grammar:\n\nI see NT8 -> 't83' as one of the productions. Yes, under NT8.\n\nSimilarly, 't67' is under NT6.\n\nSo the string starts with t83 t67. Since each production in CNF produces two non-terminals, the initial steps would involve symbols that derive these terminals.\n\nLet me outline a possible approach:\n\n1. Check if 't83' can be derived by any non-terminal. From the grammar, NT8 \u2192 t83. So in the first step, a non-terminal A must derive t83. Since A must be NT8.\n\n2. Similarly, the next token is t67, which is derived from NT6 \u2192 t67.\n\nSo the string starts with t83 t67, which would come from NT8 NT6, because in the grammar, NT8 has a production that includes t83 and a non-terminal, and NT6 has t67.\n\nWait, let's look:\n\nLooking for a production that can lead to t83 and t67. Let's see:\n\nNT8 can derive t83 (as mentioned) or also NT8 \u2192 t5 (since I see NT8 \u2192 t5).

Since our string has 't84', 't67', etc., perhaps this is beyond our current scope.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to map each token to their possible sources.\n\nWait, perhaps I can map each token in the string to their possible generating NT.\n\nFor example:\n\nt83 is NT8 \u2192 t83 (NT8 is a non-terminal)\nt67 is NT6 \u2192 t67\n\nSo the string starts with NT8 NT6.\n\nNow, in the grammar, is there a rule that allows NT8 \u2192 NT6 something? Or perhaps NT8 and NT6 can be derived from a common non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, as per the given grammar:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, the start symbol S can produce NT0 and NT4.\n\nNT0 has several productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking for NT0:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0 has:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT0\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT2 NT4\nOther productions of NT0 are to various terminals, like t23, t74, etc.\n\nWait, but in our string, the first two tokens are t83 t67, which come from NT8 t83 and NT6 t67. So, to get NT8 t83 and NT6 t67, the rule would be NT8 NT6 \u2192 t83 t67. But looking for that, is there a rule? \n\nWait, no. Because in the grammar, the non-terminals don't combine into a terminal. Each non-terminal can produce either a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of it differently: The string starts with t83 t67. So, the start symbol S (which produces NT0 NT4) would generate a sequence where the first part is the NT0 production that can lead to t83, and the second part is NT4 that can lead to t67.\n\nWait, that might not be directly possible because S's production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, meaning that the entire string is built from the concatenation of a NT0-derived string and an NT4-derived string.

{"custom_id":"request-486","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So each production is either splitting into two non-terminals or producing a single terminal symbol.\n\nThe string given is: `t5 t37 t67 t81 t31 t8 t52 t70 t57 t54 t74 t73 t2 t81 t21 t7 t67 t74 t43 t40 t62 t24 t83 t42 t26`\n\nWow, that's a lot of t's with numbers. First, I should probably look at each production rule and see which terminals are being used and how they might combine to form the string.\n\nThe grammar has a series of non-terminals: S, NT0, NT1... up to NT7, NT8, NT9, etc. Some of the productions are S -> NT0 NT4, which I assume is the starting point. Each production seems to break down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nI'll start from S and see how it can derive the string. S can become NT0 NT4. Then, each of those can be expanded further until I get terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice that most symbols are terminals like t5, t37, etc. The non-terminals, though, would have to be expanded into sequences of terminals.\n\nLet me see some rules for NT0 and NT4. NT0 has several productions, one of which is NT0 -> NT9 NT7. NT9 -> 't43', and NT7 has several options, like NT7 -> NT4 NT0 or NT7 -> NT4 NT6. NT4 -> NT8 NT6 and NT8 -> 't5' among others.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5. Let's see if any production leads to t5. Checking the rules, NT5 -> 't47', NT4 -> 't32', etc. Hmm, maybe looking for t5, let's see what produces 't5'. Looking at the production NT7 -> NT7 NT0, but that's not helpful. Maybe NT9 -> 't43', which isn't t5.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t5, which is the result of a production that eventually gives t5. Looking through the rules, I see NT3 -> 't76', but that's t76, not t5. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me list all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT3 can produce 't72', 't39', 't10', 't53', 't24', 't51', 't33', 't50', 't76', etc. Wait, perhaps I'm missing the ones for each NT.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to map all the NT's that directly produce terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72', 't31', 't53', 't24', 't51', 't33', 't50', 't76', 't73', 't39', 't10', 't5', 't51', 't24'... Hmm, seems like multiple ways, but t5 is one of them. So NT3 can produce t5.\n\nSo t5 is in NT3. So maybe the string starts with NT3.\n\nLooking at the string, after t5, it's t37, which is another terminal. Let me see which NT produces t37.\n\nLooking at NT3's rules: NT3 can produce t37 via rule NT3 -> 't37'? Wait, looking at the provided rules, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't53', 't33', 't50', 't76', 't73', etc. Wait, no, I might have miscounted. Wait, let me go through each NT rule and see.\n\nWait, in the list above, I see several:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT3 -> 't31'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't24'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT3 -> 't33'\n... etc.\n\nWait, but is there a rule where NT3 -> t37? Alternatively, perhaps the string is built from sequences of NT's that produce terminals in a certain order.\n\nWait, perhaps the string might start with S -> NT0 NT4. So NT0 can produce t23 via NT0 -> 't23' directly. But the string starts with t5, not t23. Hmm, that's a problem. So S -> NT0 NT4 would require NT0 and NT4 to be expanded into substrings that start with t5 and t37, but NT0's start symbol is t23, not t5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe more steps are needed. Perhaps S can produce other sequences through multiple productions. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string backwards or try to find the path from S.\n\nLet me outline the string: t5, t37, t67, t81, t31, t8, t52, t70, t57, t54, t74, t73, t2, t81, t21, t7, t67, t74, t43, t40, t62, t24, t83, t42, t26.\n\nWow, that's a long string. So 24 elements. Trying to see how these could be derived from S.\n\nFirst, S expands to NT0 NT4. Let's see if t5 can be derived from NT0 or NT4.\n\nLooking at the NT0 productions, one is NT0 -> NT9 NT7. NT9 can produce 't43', and NT7 can produce 't54', 't13', etc. So if NT0 expands into, say, t43 and 'something else', but 'something else' could derive into t5, perhaps? Or perhaps we have multiple steps.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t5, which is derived from NT3. So perhaps S must expand into a chain that eventually leads to NT3 producing t5 as the first symbol.\n\nBut S is NT0 and NT4. So how does NT0 or NT4 lead to t5?\n\nLooking at the rules for NT0: One of them is NT0 -> NT9 NT7. And NT9 -> 't43', NT7 could produce t54, t13, etc. So combining NT9 and NT7 might give something like 't43' followed by something else. But how to get t5 from that? Maybe further expansion.\n\nWait, maybe it's too complicated. Perhaps I should try to identify possible derivations step by step.\n\nAnother approach: the string length is 24. The grammar is context-free, so perhaps it can parse any length string. But given the specific symbols, perhaps the grammar is designed to have certain features.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can group the symbols into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write down the possible sequences of NT's that could produce the string. Let's see, starting from t5, which is an NT3. So the first part is NT3.\n\nThen it's followed by t37, which must be produced by NT3 as well, but wait, no, each symbol is derived via a production. So perhaps t5 is derived from one NT, and t37 from another, but the order in the string depends on their non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to construct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that the string has to be a concatenation of production sequences. Each symbol in the string corresponds to a terminal derived from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, for each symbol in the string, we can trace back to which NT it comes from.\n\nt5 \u2192 possible NT3.\n\nt37 \u2192 Looking at NT3's rules, I don't see 't37' as a terminal. Wait, checking:\n\nIn the rules, NT3 has several 't' rules. Let me go through them.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 can produce 't72' (NT3 -> 't72'), 't31' (NT3 -> 't31'), 't53' (NT3 -> 't53'), 't24' (NT3 -> 't24'), 't51' (NT3 -> 't51'), 't33' (NT3 -> 't33'), 't50' (NT3 -> 't50'), 't76' (NT3 -> 't76'), 't73' (NT3 -> 't73'), 't39' (NT3->'t39'), 't10' (NT3->'t10'), 't5' (NT3->'t5'), 't51' ("}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-506","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier. Each production rule has either two non-terminals on the left or a terminal on the left with exactly one non-terminal on the right. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. It starts with S -> NT0 NT4, so the start symbol is S, which expands into NT0 and NT4. NT0 and NT4 are also non-terminals, each of which expands into combinations of other non-terminals. The string that's given is a sequence of terminals, all 't's followed by numbers, which seems to be the output of the grammar.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string using the grammar, starting from the start symbol and seeing if I can break down the string into the necessary components. Since it's a context-free grammar, I'll use a top-down approach, possibly using a parse tree or something similar.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t61 t74 t14 t73 t7 t26 t9 t12 t7 t62 t62 t74 t15 t14 t54 t40 t83 t54 t11 t69 t81 t51 t26 t83 t44 t11.\n\nEach 't' followed by a number is a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these terminals appear in the correct order according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with S, which is NT0 NT4. So the string must start with the expansion of NT0 followed by NT4's expansion.\n\nNT0's production rules are quite a few: for instance, NT0 -> NT6 NT7, or NT0 -> NT9 NT7, or NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc. So I need to find a path where the initial part of the string can be derived from NT0.\n\nLooking at the string, the first terminals are t61, t74, t14, etc. So maybe NT0 can produce t61 t74...? Wait, I need to check the productions for NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5 (but wait, that's NT5 NT5, not NT0 NT0)\nWait, the initial S is NT0 NT4, so the first step is to expand NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. The grammar's start symbol is S, which expands into NT0 and NT4. So I need to expand NT0 and NT4 into their components, and so on until I reach terminals.\n\nI should perhaps look up which non-terminals can produce which terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't64', so if NT6 is in a production, it can produce a terminal t64. Similarly, NT4 has rules like NT4 -> NT8 NT6, which seems to go into more non-terminals, but looking through the rules, I see NT4 -> 't43' is a possibility in one of the rules.\n\nLooking at the NT4 rules in the grammar:\nNT4: ... Looking through, I see:\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't8'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT4 -> 't84'\n- NT4 -> 't7' (from the later lines, yes, NT4 -> 't7')\nWait, but looking back, in the grammar, there's a line: NT4 -> 't7' but actually, let me make sure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT4, one of the rules is NT4 -> 't7'. So for example, if NT4 can produce 't7', then that's a terminal. So similarly, NT0 has several rules that produce terminals, like NT0 -> 't12', 't43', etc.\n\nSo let's try to find a way the string starts with 't61' being produced by NT0. So looking at NT0's rules, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5 (but wait, that's not NT0, that's another production.)\n\nWait, no. NT0's rules are:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT0 appears several times. The key rules are:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5 (Wait, is that NT5? Because in the grammar, I see lines like NT5 -> 't53', etc.)\n\nWait, so NT0 can expand into NT6 NT7, or NT9 NT7, or NT5 NT5.\n\nWait, NT5 NT5: Wait, the initial S is NT0 NT4, so if NT0 expands into NT5 NT5, then NT4 needs to expand into something as well.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider constructing a parse tree for the entire string.\n\nLet me start step by step.\n\nThe string is of length 30: 30 elements, each a terminal.\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo the entire string must be a combination of the strings generated by NT0 and NT4. So the first split is the string into two parts: the part generated by NT0 and the part generated by NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, it's 30 elements; let's say the first m elements are generated by NT0, and the remaining (30 - m) by NT4, where m depends on how each non-terminal expands.\n\nBut to figure out m, I need to know how NT0 and NT4 generate the string. Alternatively, I can attempt to split the string into parts that correspond to NT0's expansion and NT4's expansion.\n\nBut maybe an easier approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is suitable for context-free grammars. However, given the complexity and the number of non-terminals, it might take a while, but it's feasible.\n\nAlternatively, I can attempt recursive parsing, starting with S and trying to match the string.\n\nLet me outline the initial steps.\n\nStep 1: S is NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, the entire string is t61 t74 t14 t73 t7 t26 t9 t12 t7 t62 t62 t74 t15 t14 t54 t40 t83 t54 t11 t69 t81 t51 t26 t83 t44 t11.\n\nSo, I need to parse the entire string into a tree where the root is S, with two children NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, each NT0 and NT4 must be parsed into a string that appears in their respective places.\n\nLet me first try to parse the first part as NT0 and then the second part as NT4.\n\nBut first, let's see: the terminal 't61' appears early in the string. Let's see if any NT0's expansion begins with 't61'.\n\nLooking at the NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (but wait, that's 't53' and 't53'? Maybe not relevant for starting with 't61'.\n\nWait, looking deeper, there's a rule: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then NT6 can produce various terminals. Let's check:\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT9\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- Wait, I see NT6 has several rules, including NT6 \u2192 't61'. Looking through:\n\nIn the grammar, I see lines like:\n\nNT6: -> 't11'\nYes, under NT6: 't11' appears. So NT6 can produce 't11'.\n\nWait, but how does that fit?

{"custom_id":"request-509","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: t69 t84 t20 t24 t37 t3 t60 t62 t40 t11 t47 t81 t69 t77 t73 t2 t31 t26 t12 t12 t23 t63 t84 t54 t11 t72.\n\nFirst, I remember that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side consists of two non-terminals or a terminal. So, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's all in CNF because every production right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Each production is either two symbols or a terminal. So that's good.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals, so the grammar must derive this by replacing non-terminals with these terminals step by step.\n\nI think the approach is to construct the derivation tree bottom-up or parse top-down, but since the string is long and the grammar seems complex, maybe I can look for patterns or specific productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm would be effective. But the CYK algorithm requires that the grammar is in a specific form, and I'm not sure if this grammar fits that. Also, the grammar has many non-terminals, which would make CYK computationally intensive, not just a manual task.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string is formed by substituting the starting symbol S through a series of productions. So, starting from S, can we derive the string by expanding each non-terminal into terminals or other non-terminals until we get the string.\n\nLet me look at the start symbol S. It's defined as S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, S must be split into two parts: NT0 and NT4, each of which needs to derive a sequence of terminals.\n\nLooking at the right-hand side of S, it's NT0 and NT4. So, each of these must produce a string that can be multiplied by the other to form the overall string. Wait, no, in context-free grammars, when you have A \u2192 BC, B and C are replaced in parallel. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4 means both NT0 and NT4 must be expanded into strings, and their concatenation forms the entire string.\n\nSo, the overall string should be the concatenation of the string derived by NT0 and the string derived by NT4. So, the string should be the same as concatenating the string of NT0 and NT4.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if the given string can be divided into two parts: the part derived by NT0 and the part by NT4. If so, then check each part against their respective non-terminals.\n\nLet me count the tokens: the string has 29 tokens. Each token is separated by a space, so it's a list of 29 elements.\n\nNow, let's check each production for NT0 and NT4 to see what kind of strings they can produce.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT0:\n\nNT0 has multiple productions, with different right-hand sides. For example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nWait, some seem redundant. Let me check all productions for NT0:\n\nLooking through:\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- ... and more. It seems NT0's productions end up simplifying, especially since some rules result in NT0 -> NT5 NT5, which might eventually lead to terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the possible terminal sequences each NT0 and NT4 can generate.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to work from the string and see if each part can be constructed by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me split the string into two parts, since S is NT0 NT4. Wait, actually, each part is derived by NT0 and NT4, and their concatenation forms the entire string. So, the first part is the derivation of NT0, the second part is the derivation of NT4.\n\nSo, for S, the string is the concatenation of NT0's string and NT4's string. So, I can check if the entire string is the concatenation of two substrings, each being the result of NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nLooking at the entire string: t69 t84 t20 t24 t37 t3 t60 t62 t40 t11 t47 t81 t69 t77 t73 t2 t31 t26 t12 t12 t23 t63 t84 t54 t11 t72.\n\nLet me see how to split it into two parts. Since it's concatenation of NT0 and NT4, and S is NT0 followed by NT4.\n\nWait, that's not quite right. Because in context-free grammars, production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 means S is replaced by NT0 followed by NT4 in the same order. So the entire string is just the concatenation of the outputs of NT0 and NT4.\n\nSo, the entire string is nt0_str + nt4_str.\n\nThus, I can attempt to split the given string into two parts: the first part must be nt0_str and the second part must be nt4_str.\n\nSo, I can try all possible splits and see if either part can be generated by NT0 and the other by NT4.\n\nBut that's a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can look for specific patterns in the string to see which part is nt0_str and which is nt4_str.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the production rules for NT0 and NT4 to see the possible sequences they can form.\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (maybe redundant)\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (multiple options)\nNT0 also has other productions, like NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT8 and others, but perhaps it's more productive to look for how NT0 can reach terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each production for NT0 eventually leads to terminals, so the string generated by NT0 can be any combination where each step is a series of replacements via NT0's productions.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe I can find the possible sequences from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT7\nNT4 also has other productions, like NT4 \u2192 NT37 directly, but that might be a terminal.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, at the end, there are productions like NT4 -> 't37', which is a terminal. Similarly, other non-terminals resolve to terminals.\n\nWait, let me look for end productions. For example, in the end of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37', which is a terminal. So, that's a direct production from NT4 to terminal 't37'.\n\nSimilarly, other non-terminals might resolve to specific terminals.\n\nSo, perhaps for NT4, one of the productions is NT4 \u2192 't37', meaning that NT4 can directly produce the terminal 't37'.\n\nLooking at the string, I can check if 't37' is present. Yes, it's at position 5: t37.\n\nSo, the string after 't37' would be the rest of NT0's output.\n\nWait, let me see. If NT4 produces 't37', then in the string, 't37' must be the last symbol of NT4_str, right?\n\nBecause in the concatenation, S is NT0 followed by NT4, so NT4's string would be the latter part.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, the entire string is nt0_str followed by nt4_str. So, the entire string is nt0_str + nt4_str.\n\nIf NT4 can directly produce 't37', then 't37' would be the last element of nt4_str, so the last token in the entire string would be part of nt4_str. But the entire string ends with t72, which is 't72'. Hmm, so 't37' is in the string, but it's earlier. Let's see where.\n\nLooking at the full string:\n\nt69 t84 t20 t24 t37 t3 t60 t62 t40 t11 t47 t81 t69 t77 t73 t2 t31 t26 t12 t12 t23 t63 t84 t54 t11 t72.\n\nLooking for 't37': it's the fifth token."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parse the string step by step using the grammar. Each token must appear as a terminal in one of the productions. Let me list the tokens and see their possible sources:\n\nt69: NT5 -> NT6 NT7 \u2192 t83 t54 \u2192 so t69 is t83 t54. But wait, t69 is a separate token? Or does each production that reaches a terminal directly correspond to that token. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, it might be easier to see if each token corresponds to a possible terminal in any production. Let's check which tokens are present: t69, t64, t2, t47, t72, t24, t57, t43, t54, t15, t23, t23, t7, t31, t22, t74, t63, t11, t63, t72, t14, t22, t33, t43, t81, t69.\n\nEach of these should have a production in the grammar.

Wait, perhaps it's part of a longer expansion. For example, NT6 can become t77 or other things, but t69 is another token.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps I should check each token to see if they are present as terminals in the grammar. Wait, the user provided a list of all the productions, each line starts with a non-terminal followed by -> and the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I notice that some tokens are used as terminals, like 't72' comes from NT9 -> 't72', 't47' comes from NT7 -> 't47', etc.\n\nNow, let's go through each token in the string:\n\n1. t69: Do any NT produce t69? Checking all productions... Not seeing any NT that directly produce t69. Hmm, maybe it's part of a longer chain. For example, NT3 -> t76 or others, but wait, I don't see t69 anywhere. Wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me double-check the rules given.\n\nLooking again, I see NT8 -> 't5' and t64 is from NT4 which is t5 and t83. Hmm, perhaps the approach is to see if each token is a terminal in some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is built by concatenating the terminals of the productions in the order of expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of the terminals produced by the non-terminals expanded from S. So each symbol in the string must correspond to a terminal in some production.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t69. From the grammar, I don't see any production that directly produces t69. Wait, maybe t69 is from NT5: NT5 -> NT6 NT7, which is t83 and t54. So t83 and t54 are t69 combined? No, that's not possible because each production in the grammar uses separate symbols. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grammar format. \n\nWait, is the grammar in Chomsky Normal Form? Yes, each production is either a non-terminal or a pair of non-terminals or a single terminal. So t69 is a terminal symbol, but I need to check if any rule produces t69.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any rule that produces 't69'. Hmm, but in the production rules, I see NT5 -> NT6 NT7, which are t83 and t54. So t69 is not directly produced. But t69 could be part of a longer chain. For example, if another production includes t69. Let me check all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the productions, I see NT4 -> 't47', but that's separate.

Oh wait, maybe there's a rule that produces t69 indirectly. But I don't see that.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Maybe we need to parse the string using the grammar. Starting with S, we can try to see if it can derive this string.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t69 t64 t2 t47 t69 t72 t24 t57 t43 t54 t15 t23 t23 t7 t31 t22 t74 t63 t11 t63 t72 t14 t22 t33 t43 t81 t69.\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S = NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, our start is NT0 NT4.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT0 and NT4 both have rules.

{"custom_id":"request-524","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, CNF is a specific form where each production is either a single terminal, or two non-terminals. That usually makes parsing easier, but in this case, I'm just trying to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, and according to the first production, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string we're evaluating should start with NT0 and followed by NT4. Wait, the given string starts with 't74 t60...', which I assume corresponds to the NT0 production because the string starts with t74 and then t60. Let me check the NT0 productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that NT0 can go to several options: NT9 NT7, NT6 NT7, NT0 NT5, etc. Each of these seems to be combinations of other non-terminals until they eventually resolve into terminals.\n\nNow, the string begins with t74. Let me track which NT should produce t74. Looking for t74 in the grammar, I see in the rules that NT0 can go to NT5 NT5, which could eventually result in t74. Wait, let me see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nThen, each NT5 can produce NT6 NT7. NT6 can produce NT7 NT9, and so on. Wait, no, I think I should break it down step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar. Let's consider each part:\n\nThe string is: t74 t60 t67 t84 t80 t57 t10 t56 t79 t14 t28 t83 t27 t62 t7 t17 t62 t13 t35 t54 t37 t13 t77 t64 t80 t37 t70.\n\nWait, the first part is t74, so that's likely from NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, where each NT5 eventually becomes t74. Let me see if after t74, the next part is t60. Hmm, t60 is a terminal, and in the grammar,NT9 can go to t60. Let me see:\n\nLooking at NT9 rules: NT9 \u2192 t43, but also NT9 can produce NT5 NT2. Wait, perhaps more importantly, NT9 \u2192 t60 is one of the rules (from the long list). So NT9 produces t60.\n\nSo if the string starts with t74 followed by t60, that suggest:\n\nt74 is from NT0, which might be derived as NT5 NT5, where each NT5 produces something, and one of those productions could be NT9 NT6, perhaps leading to t74 and then another step.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for each terminal in the string and see which non-terminals they can come from.\n\nLet me list the terminals in order:\n\n1. t74\n2. t60\n3. t67\n4. t84\n5. t80\n6. t57\n7. t10\n8. t56\n9. t79\n10. t14\n11. t28\n12. t83\n13. t27\n14. t62\n15. t7\n16. t17\n17. t62\n18. t13\n19. t35\n20. t54\n21. t37\n22. t13\n23. t77\n24. t64\n25. t80\n26. t37\n27. t70\n\nEach of these terminals comes from specific rules. For instance:\n\n- t74: NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5; then each NT5 needs to produce t74, which is probably through NT5 \u2192 t74 via some rule, but looking back, I don't see NT5 \u2192 t74. Wait, where is t74 in the grammar?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see that NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Then, each NT5 can go to NT6 NT7, but eventually, I think NT9 can go to t60, NT7 to t77, etc. Wait, maybe t74 is from NT0, which is split into NT5 and NT5, each producing t74 somehow.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check which NT can produce t74. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Then NT5 can produce NT6 NT7, but how does that lead to t74? Let's see further down:\n\nLooking for t74: In the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 t37, but that's after several expansions. Hmmm, perhaps t74 is from NT8 \u2192 t74? Or maybe others.\n\nWait, in the provided string, the first terminal is t74. So, in the grammar, is there an NT that can produce t74 directly? Or via a sequence of productions?\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through all the rules for NTs ending with \u2192 terminal, I think NT0 can produce t74 via some path.\n\nWait, perhaps NT9 can produce t60. Let me check NT9: NT9 can go to t60, which is one of the terminals. So if the string starts with t74, let's see, how does that happen.\n\nWait, perhaps I should track a possible parsing path. Let's say the string starts with t74, which must come from NT0. Then, the rest of the string is t60, t67, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\n1. The first symbol is t74. Let's find where t74 comes from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and each NT5 can produce NT6 NT7. Then, NT6 can go to NT9 NT8. NT9 can go to t60 or other options. Wait, maybe that's not directly t74.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t74 is produced by NT7 \u2192 t74, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me scan all the NT rules to see where t74 comes from.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\nNT0: rules include producing NT5 NT5, etc.\n\nNT4: rules include things like NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 t37, etc.\n\nNT7: rules include NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find each terminal and see how it can be generated.\n\nFor t74, perhaps it's produced by NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and each NT5 produces t74. Wait, is there a NT5 \u2192 t74 in the rules? Looking at NT5 productions, I don't see a rule that directly produces t74. Instead, NT5's productions are:\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3, NT5 \u2192 NT8 NT7, etc. But none of these directly produce a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps t74 comes from NT9, but looking back, I don't see NT9 \u2192 t74 either. Hmm, maybe t74 is from NT0 via a different path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t74 comes from NT9, but maybe through another NT. Wait, perhaps NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and each NT5 goes to NT6 NT7. Then, NT6 can go to NT9 NT8, and then NT9 can produce t60 or something else. Hmm, not matching t74.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look for all NT productions that produce a terminal:\n\nLooking through all NT productions, the terminals mentioned are t74, t60, t67, t84, t80, t57, t10, t56, t79, t14, t28, t83, t27, t62, t7, t17, t62, t13, t35, t54, t37, t13, t77, t64, t80, t37, t70.\n\nEach of these must be produced by some NT production with a terminal.\n\nLooking for, for example, t74: Is there any NT production that ends with t74?\n\nLooking at each NT:\n\n- NT0: Has rules like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. Looking for t74: None directly. So perhaps t74 is produced at a deeper level.\n\nWait, perhaps t74 comes from NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and then NT9 \u2192 t74.

{"custom_id":"request-547","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t57 t77 t12 t43 t53 t54 t83 t5 t80 t70 t15 t22 t32 t5 t53 t40 t5 t51 t80 t35 t15 t73 t63 t51 t79 t5 t80 t40`. \n\nFirst, I should recall that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that most non-terminals lead directly to terminal tokens. For example, NT0 reduces to 't23', NT2 to 't7', etc. Some of the non-terminals have multiple productions, such as NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0 and NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6.\n\nTo parse the string, I need to build a derivation starting from the start symbol S. The string must be derived exactly through a series of production rules.\n\nStarting with the string, let's see if it can be generated step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t57`. Looking at the grammar, the production NT4 \u2192 t57 is present. So S \u2192 NT4 NT0 (from S's production) should be used here.\n\nSo the first part of the string is `t57 t77 t12 ...` Wait, no, S is NT0 NT4. So the first token should be NT0 or NT4. S generates NT0 and NT4. The first token is t57. Looking at NT0 productions, I don't see a direct production that starts with NT0 \u2192 t57. However, looking further down, there's NT4 \u2192 t57. So the first step is S \u2192 NT4 NT0 \u2192 t57 (if NT4 can directly produce t57, but I need to check the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at NT4: the productions are several. One of them is NT4 \u2192 t57. So yes, NT4 can produce t57. So from S, the first thing could be t57, with the rest of the string being generated from NT0.\n\nSo now, the remaining string is `t77 t12 t43 t53 t54 t83 t5 t80 t70 t15 t22 t32 t5 t53 t40 t5 t51 t80 t35 t15 t73 t63 t51 t79 t5 t80 t40`. \n\nNext, after NT4 generates t57, NT0 needs to generate the rest. So now the problem is whether the remaining string can be generated from NT0.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT0, I see that it has multiple productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Also, NT0 can produce 't23', 't43', etc., from the productions listed.\n\nWait, let's list possible NT0 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0's productions are:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 't23', 't43', etc.\n\nBut looking at the remaining string, after t57, the next token is t77. Let's see if t77 can be from NT0 via a production.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 ... do any NT0 productions lead directly to t77? I don't see in the initial look, but perhaps through a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that each derive from specific non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider parsing the string using a top-down approach with a stack, starting from S and trying to match each token.\n\nStarting with S: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So first token must be either from NT0 or NT4. We have t57, which is from NT4, so that's the first token. Now the remaining string is from NT0.\n\nSo now, target string after S is NT0 is: t77 t12 t43 t53 t54 t83 t5 t80 t70 t15 t22 t32 t5 t53 t40 t5 t51 t80 t35 t15 t73 t63 t51 t79 t5 t80 t40.\n\nNow, let's see what NT0 can produce. The initial step after S is produced by NT4 \u2192 t57, so the rest of S's production is NT0. So we need to parse the rest of the string starting from NT0.\n\nLooking at the grammar for NT0, it has productions like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and some direct t's. Let's see if the first token in the remaining string, which is t77, can be derived from NT0.\n\nBut in the list of NT0's productions, I don't see a production that directly leads to t77. So perhaps through multiple steps. Let's try to see how t77 can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider breaking down the string into parts that match the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to try to find a leftmost derivation that can produce the given string.\n\nLooking at the production rules, let's see if any steps can be taken.\n\nThe first token is t57, which comes from NT4. So the initial part is S \u2192 NT4 NT0 \u2192 t57 NT0. Now, we need to generate the rest of the string from NT0.\n\nNT0 has several productions. Let's see which ones could lead us toward the rest of the string.\n\nLooking at the production NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Let's see what NT6 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2. Wait, that's a bit circular, but then NT2 can produce 't7' directly, among others.\n\nWait, let's try to follow this path:\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT4 NT0 \u2192 t57 NT0.\n\nThen, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nNow, the string becomes t57 (from NT4) followed by the result of NT6 NT7.\n\nNow, the next tokens after t57 are t77, t12, etc. So after t57 comes t77, which would come from NT6 or NT7, depending on their derivations.\n\nBut NT6's first production is \u2192 NT0 NT2, and NT7 has several productions, one of which is NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, which is a more complex path.\n\nAlternatively, let's check NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2 \u2192 t23 (from NT0) and t7 (from NT2). Then t23 t7, which would produce a sequence of tokens, but let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nAnother thought is that perhaps the given string is a t57 followed by steps that don't correspond to any possible derivations. But I might need to proceed more methodically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long and complex, and without a structure, it might not match any possible path in the grammar. Alternatively, maybe the grammar can generate the string through multiple layers of derivations.\n\nBut without a clear path, it's hard to tell. Another approach is to see if the string can be split into parts that each align with the grammar's possible productions.\n\nFor example, after t57 from NT4, the next token is t77. Let's see where t77 can come from.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the NTx rules, I don't see any NTx \u2192 t77. So perhaps this approach is dead.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 t57\nSo, if I have NT7, and if NT7 produces NT4 and NT0 or NT4 and NT6, then perhaps the string could have a segment starting with t57.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that the first token is NT4 \u2192 t57, then the remaining string is generated by NT0.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT4 NT0 \u2192 t57 NT0, we have the next part is generated by NT0. The first token after t57 is t77.\n\nIf NT0 can produce t77, perhaps via a chain of productions. But in the grammar, I don't see NT0 \u2192 t77. So perhaps through a chain of NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and then NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2, and NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc.\n\nThis seems complicated.

I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can sometimes have a terminal. This structure should help in parsing the string systematically.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it starts with S -> NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be derived from these two non-terminals. The string provided is: t9 t74 t57 t61 t70 t73 t51 t83 t3 t7 t44 t56 t7 t32 t63 t39 t52 t39 t24 t81 t80 t74 t31 t72 t32 t63 t20 t37.\n\nI notice that each 't' is followed by a number, which seems like a terminal symbol. So each part after 't' is a single terminal. I need to see if the entire string can be formed by expanding S according to the rules.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, the derivation process will generate a tree where each node has exactly two children, except for the leaves which are terminals. So the string should be a full binary tree with 2^n -1 nodes, where n is the number of levels. Wait, let me verify the length.\n\nThe string has 27 tokens. Let's see: 2^n -1 = 27 \u2192 2^n =28 \u2192 n is not an integer, which is impossible. That's a problem because for a full binary tree derived from a CFG in CNF, the number of terminals must be 2^k -1 for some k. 27 is not such a number because 2^5 -1 is 31 and 2^4 -1 is 15. Thus, 27 is not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me count again. The string has t9 (1), t74 (2), t57 (3), t61 (4), t70 (5), t73 (6), t51 (7), t83 (8), t3 (9), t7 (10), t44 (11), t56 (12), t7 (13), t32 (14), t63 (15), t39 (16), t52 (17), t39 (18), t24 (19), t81 (20), t80 (21), t74 (22), t31 (23), t72 (24), t32 (25), t63 (26), t20 (27), t37 (28). Wait, I miscounted earlier. It's actually 28 tokens. But 2^5 -1 is 31, which is more than 28. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think again. The start symbol S produces NT0 and NT4. Each of these non-terminals can be expanded further according to the productions. Since it's CNF, each production is two non-terminals except possibly the start. So the derivation tree for S would have S as the root, each node having two children, leading to a perfect binary tree. The number of terminal symbols must be 2^depth -1. So depth 5 gives 31 terminals, depth 4 gives 15, depth 6 gives 63. 28 is not a power of two minus one, so this suggests that the string length isn't compatible, meaning it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nTherefore, even without checking the actual productions, the string length doesn't fit the required pattern for a full binary tree derived from a CFG in CNF.

{"custom_id":"request-561","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is quite long, filled with 't' followed by numbers, and it's a bit intimidating at first glance. But I remember that for CNF grammars, the way strings are derived follows a specific pattern, often involving derivations that are directly tied to the length of the string.\n\nFirst, I should recall that context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This means that every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. Since all the productions in the given grammar seem to fit this structure, I'm on the right track.\n\nNow, when a string is generated by such a grammar, the length of the string relates directly to the number of productions applied during derivation. Each step in the derivation either replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals (increasing the length by one) or replaces it with a terminal (keeping the length the same). But since the string is being built, each terminal added must eventually be produced by some production.\n\nI think a key here is that in a CNF grammar, a string of length n must have been derived in exactly n-1 steps. For example, starting from the start symbol S, which is a single non-terminal, each step either adds a terminal or splits a non-terminal into two. So, a string of length 27 would have been derived in exactly 26 steps.\n\nLooking at the provided string: `t73 t56 t37 t63 t56 t15 t80 t28 t26 t2 t44 t84 t7 t81 t52 t81 t63 t39 t44 t64 t28 t60 t21 t42 t74 t47 t37 t33 t70`. That's 30 tokens, so the string has length 30. According to the property of CNF, the derivation length should be 29 steps. \n\nAnother thing to check is the structure of the productions. The non-terminals seem to be producing other non-terminals, which in turn produce terminals. So for each 't' in the string, I should trace back how it's generated. For example, 't73' must be generated by some production: looking at the grammar, 't73' is derived from NT6 \u2192 NT15 NT7, or maybe through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, 't73' is actually generated from NT4 \u2192 NT13, then NT4 produces 't42', which can't be right. Maybe I'm mixing up the NTs and the t's. Alternatively, perhaps each non-terminal eventually produces a specific terminal. It might be helpful to identify which non-terminals produce which terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a lot of NTs that directly produce a terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't47', etc. So each NT can have a specific terminal it expands to. The string is a sequence of these terminals, so I need to check if each terminal is produced by some NT.\n\nLet's take the first word, 't73'. Looking through the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't73' (from the production NT8 -> 't5' and NT8 -> 't73'). Wait, looking at the list, I see NT8 has multiple productions, one of which is NT8 -> 't73'. So 't73' is directly a terminal from NT8.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because in the grammar, NT8 has multiple productions, some to NTs and one to 't73'. So each 't' in the string must come from a terminal production of some NT.\n\nSimilarly, the entire string is a sequence of 't's with numbers, and each 't' (like 't73', 't56', etc.) must be produced by a non-terminal in the grammar. So if I can trace each 't' back to its corresponding NT production, then each step is valid.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that in a CNF grammar, the derivation of a string of length n will have exactly n-1 applications of productions that produce two non-terminals, and the rest produce terminals. Each application of a non-terminal that doesn't produce a terminal increases the length by one, but each terminal production doesn't change the length.\n\nBut this approach might not be straightforward for such a long string. Maybe a better way is to think about the structure of the grammar and see if all the terminals present in the string can be found as expansions from some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are NTs like NT3, NT5, NT6, etc., each producing specific 't's. For example, 't56' may be produced by NT8, since NT8 \u2192 't56' is a production? Let me check: looking at the grammar, I see NT8 \u2192 't56' is one of the productions. Wait, the productions for NT8 are listed as NT8 -> NT6 NT0, NT8 -> NT5 NT2, NT8 -> 't5', and NT8 -> 't60'. So no, 't56' isn't directly produced by NT8. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the grammar to see what each NT produces as a terminal. The grammar has a lot of rules where NTs produce terminal strings. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72' (NT3 \u2192 't72' perhaps? Wait, looking at the grammar, I see NT3 has a production NT3 \u2192 't72' (looking for 't3x' in the rules). Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7', NT3 \u2192 't53', NT5 \u2192 't47', NT6 \u2192 't83', NT7 \u2192 't60', NT8 \u2192 't56', etc. So each of these NTs produces a unique terminal string.\n\nSo for each 't' in the string, I need to ensure that it's present in the grammar as a terminal from some NT.\n\nFor example, 't73' must have an NT that can produce it. Looking through the rules, I see that NT6 \u2192 't60' and other 't's, but not 't73'. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, I think I misread the grammar. Let me look again. The productions include NT6 \u2192 't61' (NT6->'t61'), NT4\u2192't42', NT0\u2192't23', NT6\u2192't63', etc. Hmm, perhaps 't73' is a typo or I'm not seeing it correctly.\n\nWait, no, looking through the grammar provided, I see that none of the NTs directly produce 't73'. For example, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nLooking for 't73' as a production, I see:\n\nNo, I don't see any NT directly producing 't73'. So that would be a problem. Because each 't' in the string must be generated by some NT's terminal production.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake in reading the grammar? Let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't72', 't39', 't33', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't47', 't70', 't62', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't60', 't56', 't83', 't77', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't5', 't60', 't64', 't21', etc.\n- And so on.\n\nWait, 't73' isn't among the terminals of any NT in the production list I see. For example, perhaps I'm missing a production where an NT leads to 't73'. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the actual string has a different term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't73' isn't a terminal but is derived from a non-terminal that eventually produces it through multiple steps. But in a Chomsky normal form grammar, the NTs that are non-terminals would produce other NTs or terminals, so 't73' must be a terminal symbol, generated directly by an NT.\n\nSo if 't73' isn't in the list of terminals, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the grammar\u2014maybe there's a rule where an NT produces 't73'.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar provided:\n\nHere are the rules starting with NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT6 -> NT3 NT7\nNT6 -> NT8 NT6\nNT6 -> NT7 NT6\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT6 -> NT9 NT7\n... and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps 't67' is in there?

Wait, does any NT produce \"t26\"?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that one of the rules is NT2 \u2192 't7', but \"t26\" isn't directly a terminal. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's derived from further expansions. So maybe \"t26\" is part of a longer derivation chain.\n\nBut wait, let me look at the first few tokens to see the structure. The string starts with \"t26 t54 t77 t17...\". So perhaps it's a sequence of NTs being expanded. Let me map each token to possible NTs.\n\nWait, let me check each position:\n\n1. t26: Maybe NT26? But I don't see a rule named NT26. Alternatively, perhaps it's part of an NT rule. Looking at the grammar, do any NTs produce \"t26\"?\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't32', \"t5\", etc. I don't see any NT directly producing \"t26\". Hmm, maybe it's part of a longer path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and \"t26\" is produced by a specific NT.\n\nWait, looking again, I see that NT2 \u2192 't7', and other NTs might produce longer sequences. Alternatively, perhaps \"t26\" is derived from a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the string is broken down into a sequence of non-terminals and terminals, and the string must match a leftmost derivation path.\n\nAnother approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, it's suitable for a recursive descent parser or a reduction using the grammar rules.\n\nLet me attempt to see if the first token \"t26\" can be derived. However, looking through the rules, I don't see any NT that directly produces \"t26\". So, that's a problem. That would mean the first token in the string can't be generated by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, let me double-check the rules provided. Scanning through the grammar, I see rules like NT2 \u2192 't7', NT3 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't47', etc., but I don't see any rule for NTx where x is 26. So, unless \"t26\" is part of a larger production, but in CNF, each rule only produces two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nSo, for \"t26\" to come into play, it must be the result of a direct rule, like NTx \u2192 t26, but I don't see such a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me scan all the rules again. I see that NT2 \u2192 't7', but nothing leads directly to t26. Similarly, NT9 \u2192 't60', but that's t60, not t26.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the first token \"t26\" is not present in any of the direct rules of the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because the first symbol 't26' is not in the terminal symbols of the grammar.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem states that the string may or may not be in the language. So, if the first token isn't present, the answer is definitely 'No'. So, does this mean the string isn't generated by the grammar?\n\nYes, that's the conclusion. I don't see any rule that directly produces 't26', so the string starts with a symbol that the grammar can't produce, making the entire string invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-585","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to carefully think through the steps and see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that CNF grammars have production rules where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So all rules are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, I see that most of the rules are of the form NTX -> NTY NTZ, which fits CNF. However, I should check if all rules are either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Scanning through, I notice that some rules have a single terminal on the right, like NT0 -> 't23', which is fine. So the grammar is indeed in CNF.\n\nNext, I need to check if the given string can be generated by this grammar. The string is: `t60 t12 t2 t43 t17 t42 t39 t79 t57 t8 t42 t57 t28 t72 t20 t47 t76 t76 t60 t63 t67 t39 t21 t42 t81 t5 t54 t53 t83 t40`.\n\nThis string seems quite long, but I'll try to break it down. The first step is to look for the start symbol, which in this case is S. So the string must start with S's expansion. From the grammar, S produces NT0 NT4, so the first two non-terminals should be NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbols are 't60', 't12', etc. Wait, the string should start with either a terminal or the leftmost non-terminal. Since S -> NT0 NT4, both NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals. So the first production after S would be a sequence like (something) (something else). \n\nI think a better approach is to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let me outline the process:\n\n1. The entire string must be generated by applying the productions step by step, starting from S.\n\nSo let's start by considering the first two transitions from S. The first symbol after S is 't60', which would come from some expansion. Looking at the grammar, 't60' corresponds to NT6 -> 't60'? Wait, no. Looking back at the grammar details, I see that NT8 -> 't5', and many others, but I don't see NT6 going directly to 't60'. Let me check the provided rules again.\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 has several productions, such as NT6 -> NT9 NT8, NT6 -> NT0 NT2, etc., but I don't see a direct terminal production for NT6. Hmm, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check again. Oh, yes, looking through all the rules, I don't see any NT6 -> 't60'. So perhaps 't60' comes from another non-terminal that is connected through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the string and see the order of terminals and see if they can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be broken down into the productions. Let me list the terminals in the string in order:\n\nt60, t12, t2, t43, t17, t42, t39, t79, t57, t8, t42, t57, t28, t72, t20, t47, t76, t76, t60, t63, t67, t39, t21, t42, t81, t5, t54, t53, t83, t40.\n\nThis is a long string, but each terminal step must correspond to a production that directly produces that terminal, or through intermediate steps.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production step is straightforward: two non-terminals. So the string must be a series of terminals that are derived from a sequence of non-terminals expanding into terminals.\n\nSince the string starts with 't60', that terminal must come from a production of a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't60'. So I look for a non-terminal that can produce 't60' directly or through a chain.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that NT6 has some productions, but none seem to directly produce 't60'. Wait, checking again, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan the rules provided again.\n\nLooking at the rules, I see:\n\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT9 -> 't44' (Wait, no, looking at the details, I see NT9 has rules like 't21', 't44', etc., but no 't60'. So perhaps I was wrong, there's no NT6 -> 't60'. Therefore, 't60' must come from another non-terminal that transitions to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is constructed by a series of non-terminals each contributing a terminal, with each step being a binary split as per CNF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to build the leftmost derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to parse the string backward, checking if the last symbol can be derived correctly.\n\nWait, the last symbol is 't40'. From the grammar, which non-terminal can produce 't40'? Looking through, I see NT5 -> 't33', NT4 -> 't32', etc. Wait, in the provided rules, there's NT32? No, wait looking for 't40', I don't see it directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe this approach is taking too long. Let me think of another strategy. Perhaps I can count the symbols. Each production in CNF splits a non-terminal into two, so the length of the string should be 2^n - 1 for some n, where n is the number of productions. Let me count the number of 't's in the string.\n\nThe string has 31 symbols (assuming each 't' is a separate symbol with a number). 31 is 2^5 - 1, since 2^5 is 32, minus 1 is 31. So that suggests that the length matches the maximum for n=5. But maybe not, since some steps can have different splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a valid derivation of 30 splits. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that directly helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each symbol in the string is present in the grammar. That is, for each 'tX', X must correspond to a terminal that exists in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are represented by 't' followed by a number. Let me list all the terminals present in the grammar:\n\n' t40 t5 t54 t53 t83 t40' \u2013 wait, looking carefully:\n\nI think the terminals are all the letters 't' followed by a number. Based on the grammar provided, the terminals are:\n\nt0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t12, t17, t20, t21, t23, t24, t27, t28, t33, t37, t39, t42, t43, t47, t53, t54, t57, t60, t63, t67, t72, t76, t79, t81, t83.\n\nWait, but in the string given, I see 't60', 't12', 't2', 't43', 't17', 't42', 't39', 't79', 't57', 't8', 't42', 't57', 't28', 't72', 't20', 't47', 't76', 't76', 't60', 't63', 't67', 't39', 't21', 't42', 't81', 't5', 't54', 't53', 't83', 't40'.\n\nAll these are present in the terminals of the grammar. So the string consists of terminals only; no non-terminals yet.\n\nBut to generate this, the grammar must expand each terminal step by step.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each step must split into two. So the total number of symbols should be 2^n, starting from S, which is initially one symbol.\n\nWait, no.

From the given rules, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT0 NT4. So the first step is to see if S can produce the entire string.\n\nThe string starts with `t73`. Looking at the rules, I see that NT7 has a production to 't73', like NT7 \u2192 't73'. So for T0, there's a production. Wait, the rule NT7 -> 't73' is there, but I also see other rules for NT7, like NT7 -> NT4 NT0, NT7 -> NT4 NT6, etc.\n\nBut since the first symbol is 't73', it must come from NT7. So the first part of the parse would involve NT7. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 ... and then NT0 would need to produce something that gives the next symbols.\n\nWait, but let's break it down step by step. Maybe using the CYK algorithm would be a good approach, but since the string is quite long, that might take a while. Alternatively, I could try to see if each step of the grammar can produce the symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the terminal symbols in the string and see which non-terminals can derive them. Let's start by mapping out all the terminal symbols in the string:\n\nt73, t3, t81, t14, t77, t77, t70, t56, t77, t62, t76, t22, t52, t52, t14, t84, t53, t12, t79, t35, t39, t80, t15, t10, t33, t15, t31, t76, t26, t27.\n\nI need to see if the grammar can produce this sequence. I remember that in CNF, the leftmost derivation is used. So the start symbol S must produce a string where each symbol is a non-terminal except the last, which is a terminal.\n\nWait, but looking at the start symbol S, it's NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols in the derived string must be the first symbols of the productions of NT0 and NT4. Wait no, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals except for the terminals. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first step is S produces something like NT0 NT4, then each of those can produce more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if I can parse the string using the grammar. Let me try to see for each step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with `t73`. Looking at the grammar, the terminal symbols start with `t73` in the production NT7. So the first symbol must come from NT7.\n\nLet me look for the production NT7 \u2192 't73'. It exists, so NT7 can produce 't73'. So that's the first symbol.\n\nNow, the next symbol is `t3`. Looking at the rules, which non-terminals can produce 't3'? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. Wait, I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal can derive 't3'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at NT3, which is one of the rules. I see that NT3 has several productions ending with 't3' or other symbols. Wait, in the given rules, NT3 can produce 't3' because there's a rule NT3 \u2192 't3', right? Looking back, yes, I see a line: NT3 -> 't3'. So NT3 can produce 't3'.\n\nWait, but in the first step, NT7 produces 't73', which is the first symbol. Then, the next is 't3', which is from NT3. So how does that connect? Because after NT7, we need to have something that can produce 't3' as the next terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial steps would be to expand NT7 into 't73', and then the next part should be something that starts with NT3. So after 't73', we have 't3', so perhaps NT7 is followed by NT7 again, but let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this by parsing the string step by step.\n\nWait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should try to parse the entire string using the grammar.\n\nLet's try to see.\n\nThe string starts with 't73', which is produced by NT7. So we have NT7 as the first component. But in CNF, after S, we have NT0 NT4. So after that, each of those can generate more symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, NT0 must generate the next part of the string, and NT4 must generate the rest. But how?\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with NT7, and since the start symbol is S, which is NT0 NT4, maybe we need to find a way to have NT7 be part of either NT0 or NT4.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire string as being generated by NT0 and NT4 from S.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the entire string and see if it can be divided into a sequence where each symbol is either a terminal or derived by a non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build a parse tree.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, maybe it's better to look for conflicts or patterns.\n\nWait, looking at the first few tokens: t73, t3, t81, t14, t77,...\n\nWait, the first symbol t73 comes from NT7. So NT7 must be one of the non-terminals in the leftmost part. So how do I get from S to NT7? Because S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so at least one of NT0 or NT4 must produce NT7 as part of their derivation.\n\nWait, so let's suppose that:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n2. NT4 \u2192 ... and then ... \u2192 another non-terminal that starts the parsing.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals. So I can try to find the first non-terminal that can produce the sequence starting with 't73'.\n\nThe first token is 't73', which comes from NT7. So the first part must involve NT7.\n\nBut S is NT0 NT4, which means that in the initial step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So perhaps one of NT0 or NT4 can expand into NT7.\n\nBut looking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 doesn't have a production that starts with NT7, as far as I can see. The rules for NT0 are things like NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, etc. Wait, looking at the rules:\n\nFrom the given, the NT0 rules are:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nAlso, NT0 has some rules with NT5 and NT6, but I don't see NT0 \u2192 NT7 directly. So perhaps NT0 can produce something involving NT7.\n\nBut another thought: Since the first symbol is 't73', which comes from NT7, and S is NT0 NT4, perhaps S must derive NT7 somewhere in the expansion. But that might not be directly possible unless either NT0 or NT4 can produce NT7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first expansion is S \u2192 NT7 something else. Wait, no, because S is defined as NT0 NT4, not NT7. So perhaps the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and then NT0 must produce tokens that eventually derive the string.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think step by step for each symbol in the string and see if each can be produced by the available non-terminals.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt73, t3, t81, t14, t77, t77, t70, t56, t77, t62, t76, t22, t52, t52, t14, t8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-606","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, let's start by understanding what CNF means. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. The grammar provided seems to follow this structure with various non-terminals and terminals.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is: t5 t31 t5 t2 t40 t51 t84 t57 t20 t23 t44 t63 t37 t73 t13 t70 t17 t3 t83 t22 t37 t77 t15 t73 t2 t31 t74 t84 t33 t54 t60.\n\nFirst, I should note that each production in the grammar either produces a terminal or a pair of non-terminals. Since this is a binary grammar (each production has exactly two non-terminals on the left), I can use a bottom-up parsing approach, like the CYK algorithm, to check if the string is in the language.\n\nBut wait, I'm more familiar with the CYK algorithm, so maybe I'll go with that. The CYK algorithm works by constructing a table where each cell contains the possible non-terminals that can derive the substring corresponding to that cell. Let me outline the steps I need to follow:\n\n1. **Initialize the table**: The number of rows equals the length of the string. Each row corresponds to a position in the string. The first row contains each terminal as an individual symbol, so each cell will have the corresponding non-terminal that directly produces that terminal.\n\n2. **Fill in the table**: For each row (from the second to the last), and for each possible starting column, determine all possible non-terminals that can derive the substring starting at that column and spanning the length of the row.\n\n3. **Check for the start symbol**: After filling the table up, if the start symbol S can be derived for the substring covering the entire string, the string is in the language.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The string starts with t5 and ends with t60. Let's see which non-terminals produce t5. Looking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't14'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- Others produce t's like t3, t4, etc.\n\nSo, t5 can be produced by NT5 or NT8. Let me see: Looking more carefully, in the rules, NT8->'t5'). Hmm, but wait, some of the rules might be more general. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see rules like NT8 -> NT5 NT3 and other more specific rules, including NT8 -> 't5'. Similarly, NT5 has multiple rules, including NT5 -> 't47' among others.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find which non-terminals can directly produce each t in the string. For 't5', let's check each production:\n\nLooking through all the rules, I see NT5 and NT8 can produce 't5'. NT5->'t47' is a production for NT5, but that's a specific one, perhaps. Wait, looking more carefully, in the given rules:\n\nLooking for productions where the right-hand side is a terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47' (this seems like a mismatch because 't5' is different)\nWait, maybe I misread. Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps the rules are a list where some produce terminals. Looking through:\n\nIn the grammar, I see NT5 has several rules, like:\n\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT5 -> 't27'\nND5 -> 't72' (Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the rules go from NT5 to various things, some are terminals. Let me list all NT5's productions:\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT5 -> 't47' (I think a typo, perhaps it's supposed to be 't5'? Or maybe it's correct as 't47'.)\nWait, in the grammar provided:\n\nLooking carefully, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't47', NT0 -> 't74', NT8->'t11', etc. Hmm, so 't5' is not directly produced by any rule except maybe NT8? Let me check NT8:\n\nLooking through the grammar, find all rules for NT8:\n\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT2\n- etc.\nWait, no, I think I may have missed that. Let me scan again.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking for NT8's rules:\n\nNo NT8 -> 't5' in the provided grammar. Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the rules line by line.\n\nLooking for NT8 in the grammar:\n\nLooking through all lines, I see NT8 has:\n\n- NT8 -> 't5' (Line 24), but actually, upon closer look, the line says \"NT8->'t5'\". So yes, there's a rule NT8->'t5'. Wait, but in the provided grammar, the line \"NT8 -> 't5'\" is correct. So NT8 can produce 't5'. Okay.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has rules including NT5->'t5'? Or is it 't47'? Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar, under NT5, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't47' (line before NT7->'t13'), so that's 't47', which doesn't help with 't5'. But then there's another NT5 production: \"NT5->'t33'\". Hmm, but in the given string, the first token is 't5', so the first step would be looking for which non-terminals can derive 't5', which are NT8 and perhaps others.\n\nWait, maybe I should create a list for each terminal, which non-terminals can produce it. That would help in building the table.\n\nSo for each terminal 'tX' in the string, find possible NTs that can produce it.\n\nFor 't5':\n\n- NT8->'t5'\n\nSo the first element is NT8.\n\nFor 't31':\n\nLooking for any production where terminals include 't31'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, under NT6, I see:\n\n- NT6->'t77'\n- etc.\n\nWait, 't31' is produced by which non-terminals? Let's see NT3 has:\n\nLooking through all NT3 rules:\n\n- NT3->'t72'\n- NT3->'t53'\n- etc.\n\nWait, the terminal is 't31', looking through all NT rules, I don't see any production that directly produces 't31'. Hmm, that's a problem because the second token is 't31', and our grammar doesn't directly produce 't31' from any production. So does that mean the string cannot be generated by the grammar?\n\nWait, but maybe 't31' can be derived from a combination of non-terminals. Let me check if any non-terminals produce 't31' as part of a two-symbol production.\n\nWait, NT3 has:\n\n- NT3->'t72'\n- NT3->'t53'\n- NT3->'t31'?\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, under NT3, I see:\n\n- \"NT3->'t72'\"\n- \"NT5->'t47'\"\n- \"NT7->'t13'\"\n- \"NT3->'t70'\"\n- ... etc.\n\nWait, let me check the provided grammar more carefully. The user provided the grammar in a list format, each rule on a new line. Let me scan through to see if any rule ends with 't31'.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Line 17: NT3->'t53' (so 't53')\n- Line 18: NT5->'t47' (not relevant to 't31')\n- Line 20: NT8->'t5'\n\nWait, I don't see any NT producing 't31' directly. Hmm, so the second token is 't31', which isn't produced directly by any rule. So if that's the case, then the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but the initial string starts with 't5', which is produced by NT8. Then 't31' needs to be produced by something, but maybe the first step is to have a non-terminal that can produce t5 and t31 together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't31' is an intermediate step. Let me see if any non-terminals produce 't31' in combination.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Since all productions on the left have exactly two symbols on the right, each production represents a step in the derivation where a non-terminal is replaced by two other symbols.\n\nThe string is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals map directly to specific 't' terms, like NT0 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't72', and so on.

Wait, looking at the grammar, NT0 has multiple productions: NT0\u2192t20, but I need to check. From the provided grammar, NT0 has: NT0 \u2192 t28, t43, t5, t74, t80, t9, t77, t77, t83. Wait, perhaps I should go through each 't' and see which non-terminal it comes from.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to build a reverse mapping: for each 't' in the string, find which non-terminal it's associated with.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 't' corresponds to a production like NT0 \u2192 't23', so 't23' is NT0. Similarly, t43 is NT7, t28 is NT0, t56 is NT8, t42 is NT6, t20 is NT0, t5 is NT6, etc.\n\nSo let me list each 't' in the string and map it to the non-terminal:\n\nt28 \u2192 NT0\nt56 \u2192 NT8\nt42 \u2192 NT6\nt67 \u2192 NT6\nt28 \u2192 NT0\nt42 \u2192 NT6\nt64 \u2192 NT8\nt22 \u2192 NT4\nt74 \u2192 NT0\nt40 \u2192 NT0\nt7 \u2192 NT?\nWait, looking for t7. Hmm, looking at the grammar, I don't see a direct mapping for t7. Wait, the production NT2\u2192t7 is present: NT2\u2192t7. Or more accurately, looking for where 't7' is generated. Let me check: the provided grammar includes NT2 \u2192 't7', which is under NT2 productions. So 't7' comes from NT2.\n\nSimilarly, t15 comes from NT5, because NT5 \u2192 t15 (check the grammar: yes, under NT5 productions, there's NT5\u2192t15). Wait, let me confirm: looking at the grammar, under NT5, it's NT5 \u2192 t15. So t15 is NT5.\n\nt32 is from NT5 as well, since NT5\u2192t32.\n\nt64 is NT8.\n\nt20 is NT0.\n\nt39 comes from multiple non-terminals, but looking at the grammar, it's under NT3: NT3\u2192t39 (at least). So t39 is NT3.\n\nt52 is from NT5: NT5\u2192t52? Wait, checking the grammar: under NT5, it's NT5\u2192t33, NT5\u2192t32, etc. Wait, let me find the exact productions:\n\nLooking at the grammar, in sections, under NT5:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t15\n...\nAlso, NT5 \u2192 t32\n...\nAnd also NT5 \u2192 t52? Looking through the full grammar list, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, under NT5, we have:\n\nNT5\u2192t15,\n...\nAlso, in another part: NT5 \u2192 t33,\nAnother: NT0 \u2192 t52 (but wait, NT0 is on the left, and that's the production). Wait, no, looking more carefully, I think under NT5, it's:\n\nLooking through all the NT5 productions: I see NT5 \u2192 t15, t32 (in NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and something else), and also, under NT5\u2192 t10?

Let me list all NT5 productions carefully:\n\nThe grammar has:\nNT5 \u2192 t47 (from NT4\u2192t42, etc.? Wait, perhaps I'm misreading.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar lines:\n\nLooking for NT5: I see several lines:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 t15\n- NT5 \u2192 t33\n- NT0 \u2192 t52 (but that's NT0, not NT5)\n- NT5 \u2192 t39? No, perhaps looking at when a NT3 is replaced: Looking for NT5 production towards t39: I don't see it. So perhaps t39 comes from NT3.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the grammar and create a mapping of 't' to non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by processing the string from the start and trying to split it into symbols that correspond to the left-hand sides of the grammar, then recursively check each part.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe a better approach is to see if all the 't's can be mapped to non-terminals, and then see if we can form the string by replacing the non-terminals with their productions, checking recursively.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to map each 't' in the string to the non-terminal that generates it, and then ensure that the overall string can be built through the grammar.\n\nSo let's list each 't' and note the non-terminals:\n\n1. t28 \u2192 NT0\n2. t56 \u2192 NT8\n3. t42 \u2192 NT6\n4. t67 \u2192 NT6\n5. t28 \u2192 NT0\n6. t42 \u2192 NT6\n7. t64 \u2192 NT8\n8. t22 \u2192 NT4\n9. t74 \u2192 NT0\n10. t40 \u2192 NT0\n11. t7 \u2192 NT2\n12. t15 \u2192 NT5\n13. t32 \u2192 NT5\n14. t64 \u2192 NT8\n15. t20 \u2192 NT0\n16. t39 \u2192 NT3\n17. t52 \u2192 Wait, I don't see a direct mapping for t52. Looking through grammar, NT0 \u2192 t52, but that's for NT0, not another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps I need to check again. Hmm, looking at the grammar, in the NT0 productions, there's a line: NT0 \u2192 t52. So 't52' comes from NT0, not any other non-terminal.\n\n18. t5 \u2192 looking at the grammar, where does t5 come from? Looking through, I don't see any production generating 't5', but perhaps I'm missing it. Wait, the grammar includes NT3\u2192t53 and others, but not 't5'. Hmm, maybe it's from a different production. Alternatively, perhaps I misread it. Let's check: in the grammar, NT4\u2192t5, yes, because line says NT4\u2192t5. So 't5' comes from NT4.\n\n19. t61 \u2192 I don't see 't61' in any production. So perhaps this is a problem because 't61' may not correspond to any non-terminal.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar for 't61'. Looking through the grammar lines, I don't see a production that generates 't61'. So 't61' cannot be produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, which means that the string contains a 't61' that can't be generated, making the entire string ungrammatical.\n\nWait, that seems to be a major issue. Because if any of the 't's in the string can't be mapped to a non-terminal, then the string isn't part of the language.\n\nSo first, let me check for 't61' in the grammar. Looking through all the lines, under the grammar, none of the productions end with 't61'. So 't61' is not present. Therefore, the string has 't61' which isn't possible, so the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar seems to follow CNF since all productions on the left are single symbols on the right.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, all elements are 't' followed by numbers, which are likely terminals. The grammar's right-hand sides consist of terminals and non-terminals, so each step in the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two other symbols until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string has 34 tokens. Since each production in CNF replaces a non-terminal with exactly two symbols (either non-terminals or terminals), the length of the string should be a power of 2. Let's check: 34 is not a power of 2 (2^5=32, 2^6=64). So that's a red flag. \n\nWait, that doesn't necessarily mean it's invalid. If the grammar allows a string of any length, but in CNF, the derivation tree's height is related to log2(n+1), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the string's length doesn't match the number of steps required, making it impossible.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the initial string is 't28 t7 t44 ...' up to 34 tokens. Let's check how many tokens there are in the string. I'll count them: the string separated by spaces includes 34 elements. Hmm, that's 34, which is 34. Let me recount: t28 (1), t7 (2), t44(3), t80(4), t32(5), t21(6), t23(7), t26(8), t57(9), t53(10), t21(11), t57(12), t33(13), t40(14), t8(15), t84(16), t3(17), t77(18), t77(19), t39(20), t5(21), t35(22), t74(23), t27(24), t37(25), t9(26), t47(27), t31(28), t3(29), t81(30), t47(31), t81(32). Wait, so that's 32 tokens. Oh, I must have miscounted earlier. So the string has 32 symbols, which is 2^5, so that fits the number of steps required in a derivation starting from S, which in CNF would produce after each step 2^n symbols.\n\nBut wait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first expansion would produce two non-terminals, which then each could expand into two more, etc. The length after each step is a power of two, but the string we have is 32 symbols, which is 2^5, so it would require a derivation that starts from S and goes through 5 expansions, each time doubling the number of symbols.\n\nBut I should check if each 't' symbol in the string is present in the grammar as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, I see that several rules have terminals as their right-hand sides. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23', NT2 \u2192 't7', etc. Each terminal corresponds to one of these 't' numbers in the string.\n\nSo each step of the derivation should replace a non-terminal with two symbols, either non-terminals or terminals. The string must be constructed by such replacements, ending with all terminals.\n\nBut the key point is that 32 is a power of two, so in terms of the derivation steps, it's possible. However, another approach is to look for any obvious inconsistencies. For example, if a production leads to a certain terminal, but it doesn't appear anywhere, or if a production is required but it's missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a way to parse the string step by step, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can notice some terminals that don't appear in the grammar, but looking at the string, all 't' numbers from t7 to t84 are present as terminals in the grammar, so that's fine.\n\nAnother approach: check if all the terminals in the string are indeed terminal symbols in the grammar. For example, t84 is present in NT8 \u2192 t84, so it's a terminal. Similarly, t43 appears in NT4\u2192t43 and NT5\u2192t43, etc. So all 't' numbers in the string are terminals.\n\nThus, the string is possible as a combination of these terminals, but I need to see if there's a path through the grammar that produces exactly this sequence.\n\nBut considering the string has 32 symbols, which is manageable, but writing out the entire parse tree would be time-consuming. Perhaps I can check for whether each terminal follows from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be broken down step by step. Let me try to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nFor example, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S can generate a string where the first symbol comes from NT0 and the second from NT4. Let me check if the first few symbols can be derived this way.\n\nBut the string starts with t28 t7 ... So perhaps NT0 \u2192 t28 ... but looking at the grammar, NT0 has several productions. Let me look at NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, NT6 NT9, and others like NT5 NT5, NT9 NT9, etc. Also, NT0 appears in NT9's productions and others.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, here are the productions for NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT3 NT7 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check the list again. The user provided a long list, but it's a bit confusing.)\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT6 NT9\nNT0 -> NT3 NT7?

Let me try to list all NT6 productions:\n\nLooking back:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT5 NT6\n\nWait, no, perhaps more accurately:\n\nFrom the initial list, for NT6, the productions are:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\n\nWait, no, the user's initial list is long, but perhaps I'm missing some. Let me check from the start.\n\nLooking through all productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT2\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n\nWait, but also:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8? Wait, I'm getting confused. The initial list is long, and I might be missing NT0's other productions. Let me see:\n\nLooking further down, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT3 NT7 (Is this correct?

The string provided is quite long, with 30 tokens separated by spaces. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) means. In CNF, every production rule is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This helps in parsing because it simplifies the grammar, making it easier to apply certain algorithms like the CYK algorithm.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it seems to consist of a set of non-terminals and terminals. The non-terminals are represented by letters like S, N, T, etc., and the terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like t5, t64, etc.\n\nMy goal is to see if the given string can be derived by the grammar. One approach is to try to parse the string using the grammar, but since the string is quite long, it might be tedious to do manually. Alternatively, I can check for certain patterns or lengths that the grammar enforces.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. Each production is left-branching and only has two symbols on the right side, except for the terminals which are single symbols. So, each production is either a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nAnother point is that the grammar defines a certain context-free language. Since it's in CNF, perhaps it's suitable for a parser that uses the structure of CNF, like the recursive descent parser. However, without writing a parser, I need another way.\n\nMaybe I can look for patterns in the string that correspond to the productions. Let's list all the terminals in the string: t5, t64, t37, t73, t8, t51, t14, t20, t3, t7, t39, t74, t12, t61, t63, t84, t84, t3, t47, t63, t14, t56, t44, t7, t57, t33, t37, t2, t37, t27, t67, t73.\n\nI notice that some terminals occur multiple times, like t73 appears twice, t7 thrice, etc. The grammar must have a way to generate such sequences.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, several produce a terminal followed by another production. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which would expand to NT0 and NT4, each of which have their own productions.\n\nBut manually expanding each step would take too long. Maybe I can look for possible expansions that result in the given terminals.\n\nWait, another idea: since the grammar is in CNF, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. The overall process of generating the string from S would involve a number of steps equal to the depth of the parse tree, which would correspond to the length of the string minus one (since each production adds one symbol or two).\n\nThe given string has 30 symbols. In a binary tree, the number of nodes is one more than the leaves. So, if the string has 30 symbols, it would correspond to a parse tree with 29 nodes. However, the grammar's rules might allow for different structures. But this approach might not be the most straightforward.\n\nPerhaps I should try to reverse-engineer the string by seeing if each terminal appears in the grammar. Looking at the string, all terminals are of the form t followed by a number. Checking each one to see if it's present in the grammar:\n\n- t5: Yes, appears in several rules (NT3 \u2192 't53', etc.)\n- t64: Yes, NT6 \u2192 t83, so t64 if it's part of a longer production.\nWait, each terminal is a single symbol, but in the grammar, some productions directly map to a terminal. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', so t72 is a terminal. But in the string, I see t64, which I need to check if there is a rule that produces it.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see rules like NT6 \u2192 t83, but t64 doesn't directly appear. Wait, maybe t64 comes from a production that eventually expands to it through other rules. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must be a single expansion from S. Let me consider the structure of the grammar. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So, the first two symbols in the generated string should be part of the expansion of NT0 and NT4. Looking at the string, the first two symbols are t5 and t64. So, for the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would generate something that starts with NT0 followed by NT4. Let's see what NT0 and NT4 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0 has two productions:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nSo, looking at the first few symbols: t5 t64. Let's see if NT0 can produce t5 and NT4 can produce t64.\n\nLooking up NT0's productions: Suppose NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then the first symbol after S would be NT6, which needs to produce t5. Let's see what NT6 can do. NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT9 or other possibilities, but maybe t64 is part of another production.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should check if each terminal in the string is present in the grammar as direct productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT0 can produce t74. Wait, in the grammar rules, I see several where NT0 is mapped to a terminal:\n\nLooking through the list:\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT0 \u2192 t74\n- NT0 \u2192 t43 (twice)\n- NT0 \u2192 t52\n- NT0 \u2192 t80\n- NT0 \u2192 t77 (twice)\n- NT0 \u2192 t40\n- NT0 \u2192 t12\n- NT0 \u2192 t53\n- NT0 \u2192 t67\n- NT0 \u2192 t35\n\nWait, no, looking back: Actually, some NT0 productions produce a terminal, like NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Or perhaps I misread.\n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. The user provided a long list of rules, some of which have the form NTx \u2192 'ty' meaning that NTx produces the terminal 'ty'.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT5 \u2192 't33'\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- NT7 \u2192 't54'\n- NT0 \u2192 't74'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT7 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't8'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT5 \u2192 't10'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- ... and so on.\n\nWait, I see that several NTx rules map directly to a 't' followed by a number. For example, NT8 \u2192 t5, NT0 \u2192 t23, etc.\n\nSo, to see if the string starts with t5 t64, maybe after expanding S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the NT0 could be producing t5, and NT4 producing t64.\n\nBut wait, looking at NT0's productions, does it ever produce t5?

The string is composed of tokens like 't47', 't44', and so on. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. The grammar provided has all these forms, so that's correct. The starting symbol is S.\n\nThe string to check is: t47 t44 t2 t22 t37 t77 t57 t77 t11 t64 t84 t63 t77 t53 t17 t27 t69 t39 t79 t5 t52 t51 t13 t72 t80 t40 t20 t31 t56 t43 t10 t2 t40.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the given grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the parse tree should consist of binary trees where each node is either a terminal or has exactly two children.\n\nLet's start by looking at the symbols. First, 't47' and 't44'. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 -> t54. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me check the productions:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see a production where NT7 directly produces 't47' or 't44'. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, under NT3: some rules produce 't72', 't70', etc. Let's see where the symbols come from.\n\nLet me list the terminals and see their sources. For example:\n\n- 't47' appears in NT4's production: NT4 -> t37, t32, etc. Wait, no. Looking through the grammar, for example, NT4 is defined in several places:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT7 -> t13 (I think that's incorrect because NT7 is a non-terminal, but maybe I'm missing something.

Hmm, in the production rules, I don't see a direct production for 't47', but looking further, I see NT48 (Wait, no...

Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but assuming the problem statement is correct, I need to see where these 't's come from.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 't' is the result of a chain of productions. For example, 't44' could be reached through multiple steps, but for a string as long as this, that's impractical to track step by step.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to look for any non-terminals that directly produce these 't's.\n\nWait, let me make a note: \n\n- 't47' is produced by NT5.\n\n- 't44' is produced by... Hmm, perhaps looking back at the grammar, I might have missed a production.\n\nWait, I see in the rules, NT7 -> 't13', NT7 -> 't43', and NT7 -> 't57', but I don't see 't44' directly. Perhaps it's produced via another path.\n\nWait, maybe 't44' is part of another production.

{"custom_id":"request-647","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which I remember is a form where each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the left and exactly two symbols (either terminals or non-terminals) on the right. That might help because some parsers or algorithms like the CYK algorithm can work with this form, but I'm not sure if I need any of that here.\n\nFirst, I'll need to understand the grammar better. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, which produces NT0 NT4. Each NT here is a non-terminal symbol, and the terminals are the 't' followed by a number. So the string I need to evaluate consists of these terminals, and each production in the grammar must eventually resolve to these terminals.\n\nThe string given is:\n\nt51 t26 t63 t64 t83 t84 t62 t23 t33 t63 t8 t21 t74 t60 t32 t72 t47 t72 t79 t73 t77 t72 t26 t33 t39 t52 t20 t84 t20 t14 t51 t35 t84\n\nThat's quite a long string, 35 tokens I think. Each token is a terminal, so each must be the result of a production where all non-terminals are expanded.\n\nI'll start by trying to break down the string into possible non-terminals and see if the grammar can produce this sequence.\n\nFirst, starting from S -> NT0 NT4. So the string must start with the symbols that NT0 can produce and thenNT4 can produce, concatenated together. So the entire string is the concatenation of two parts: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't51'. So let's see what NT0 can produce. NT0 has several productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT6 NT0\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\n\nWait, but to make this manageable, I'll make a note of all the possible terminals and how they're produced.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0, the possible terminals it can reach are:\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n1. NT0 -> NT6 NT7: So this would require NT6 and NT7 to produce their respective terminals.\n2. NT0 -> NT9 NT7: Similarly, terminals from NT9 and NT7.\n3. NT0 -> NT5 NT5: Both NT5s producing their terminals.\n4. NT0 -> NT2 NT9: NT2 and NT9 producing terminals.\n5. NT0 -> NT6 NT0: This is recursive, so it would eventually need to expand into terminals.\n6. NT0 -> NT2 NT9: Same as above.\n\nLooking at NT0's possible expansions, each path leads to two non-terminals being resolved. Similarly, NT4 has several productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT3 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT4 NT7\n\nBut wait, NT4's start is producing NT4, which is non-terminal, so it's producing through NT4's productions.\n\nThis process might get complicated quickly, but maybe I can approach this step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a sequence of steps where each terminal corresponds to a production step. Since each production in CNF is of the form A -> BC, each step in the derivation would involve two symbols being concatenated.\n\nThe given string has 35 terminals, so the derivation must have 34 steps because each step adds one terminal, but given that in CNF each step processes two symbols, maybe that's not correct. Wait, in CNF, each production has two symbols on the right, so each production step in the derivation can potentially produce one terminal from two, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production step takes two symbols (left as A, right as BC) and replaces A with BC. So when building the parse tree, each non-terminal at each level splits into two child symbols. The initial step would start with S -> NT0 NT4, so the parse tree has two children: NT0 and NT4.\n\nEach of those, if non-terminals, would split further according to their productions. Each time, a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, which could be terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo the entire derivation starts at S, splits into NT0 and NT4, then each of those splits again, and so on until all symbols are terminals.\n\nGiven that, the string is a sequence of terminals and the question is whether there's a way to split the string into pairs that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case since each production step can produce two terminals at once, but perhaps the string as a whole should be built by concatenating pairs from the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, the string could be the result of a sequence of replacements where each non-terminal is expanded into a pair of symbols, which themselves could be terminals or non-terminals, recursively until the end.\n\nBut considering the string length is 35, which is odd (since each step doubles the number of symbols unless a terminal is produced), it's possible that the number of symbols must be compatible with the grammar's derivation.\n\nWait, but in reality, the number of symbols after expansion could vary since some terminal productions might add a single terminal symbol, but in this grammar, each production expands one non-terminal into two others, so each step leads to an increase in the number of symbols by one. Hmm, but that might not be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this using a recursive approach, checking if the string can be split into segments that match the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me try to approach this by identifying possible pairs in the string that match any production rule.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which is designed to determine if a string is generated by a grammar in CNF. But implementing the CYK algorithm would be time-consuming, and since I'm just trying to figure it out manually here, maybe there's a way to see if the string can be broken down step by step.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt51 t26 t63 t64 t83 t84 t62 t23 t33 t63 t8 t21 t74 t60 t32 t72 t47 t72 t79 t73 t77 t72 t26 t33 t39 t52 t20 t84 t20 t14 t51 t35 t84\n\nLet me see if I can find starting points.\n\nStart with S -> NT0 NT4, so the string must start with NT0 expanding into some sequence and NT4 expanding into another. So the string should be split into two parts: part1 = NT0's expansion, part2 = NT4's expansion.\n\nLooking at part1: t51...? Let me see. The start might be NT0 -> NT5 NT5, which is two terminals.\n\nBut looking at part1, after t51, I see t26, which is a possible term. Wait, what does NT0 -> NT5 NT5 produce? If NT5 can produce two 't's, perhaps t51 is from NT5.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions, such as NT5 -> NT9 NT6, which would produce terminals if NT9 and NT6 can.\n\nBut stepping back, perhaps it's better to try to find the end of the string and see if it matches NT4's possible productions.\n\nThe last few symbols are t72, t33, t39, t52, t20, t84, etc. Wait, t72 is a terminal.\n\nLooking at NT4's possible expansions, perhaps it can end with something like t20 t84, which might correspond to a production rule.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT4, I see NT4 -> NT8 NT7, which would produce two terminals. Let's see what NT8 and NT7 can produce.\n\nWait, NT7 has productions like NT7 -> NT4 NT0, NT7 -> NT4 NT6, etc. Let's see if NT7 can produce a terminal pair.\n\nBut maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

{"custom_id":"request-662","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided CFG. The string is quite long, but I'll start by analyzing the grammar and the string step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That simplifies things because CNF ensures that the derivation is efficient and we can apply the CYK algorithm if needed. But since the string isn't too long, maybe I can parse it manually or look for a pattern.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So any valid string should be a concatenation of the two symbols generated by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me check the NT0 and NT4 productions. NT0 seems to have several rules leading to combinations of other NT symbols and terminals. For example, NT0 can produce NT9 NT7 or NT7 NT9, etc. Similarly, NT4 can produce various combinations, including terminals like t5, t8, t13, etc.\n\nThe string given is: \"t10 t26 t56 t42 t13 t83 t56 t11 t84 t5 t27 t40 t60 t8 t27 t33 t51 t9 t56 t10 t57 t37 t52 t72 t72 t47 t22 t5 t81 t22 t26 t8 t73 t5\"\n\nI notice that the string has a lot of t's followed by numbers. Each t seems to correspond to a terminal in the grammar. My task is to see if this string can be derived from S using the given productions.\n\nLet me break down the string into individual terminals: t10, t26, t56, t42, t13, t83, t56, t11, t84, t5, t27, t40, t60, t8, t27, t33, t51, t9, t56, t10, t57, t37, t52, t72, t72, t47, t22, t5, t81, t22, t26, t8, t73, t5\n\nNow, I'll try to find a way to build this string from the grammar. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the string must start with something derived from NT0 followed by something from NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0 and NT4 productions, especially the ones that produce terminals:\n\nWait, but in CNF, the productions only have two non-terminals or terminals. So each production is a binary split. That means the entire process is a series of splits, each time replacing a symbol with two others until you reach the terminals.\n\nBut this is complicated because the string is long, and manually tracing each step would take too long. Maybe I can see if each t corresponds to a terminal in some production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some NT symbols directly produce terminals:\n\n- For example, NT6 \u2192 't83', which is in the string as t83.\n- Similarly, NT8 \u2192 't5', which is t5 in the string as the 10th element.\n- NT4 \u2192 't13' (t13 is present as the 5th element)\n- NT8 \u2192 't42' (t42 is the 4th element)\n- NT4 \u2192 't27' (t27 is the 10th element)\n- NT0 \u2192 't26' (t26 is the 2nd element)\n- Wait, but looking at NT0's productions, there's NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and sometimes it goes to terminals directly. For example, in some cases, NT0 produces 't26' directly? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, under NT0:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5\n- Wait, but none of the direct productions under NT0 are the terminals given. So perhaps NT0 is expanded into non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can produce 't13', 't5', 't27', etc. So t13, t5, t27, t56, etc., must be reachable through the grammar.\n\nLet me list out the terminals in the string and see if I can find a sequence in the grammar.\n\nt10: Does any production lead to t10? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the NT rules, I see that some have NT8 \u2192 't84', 't81', etc. Hmm, no NT directly producing t10.\n\nWait, but maybe t10 is generated through a series of non-terminals. Let me look at the NT productions for 't10'. For example, in the grammar:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't13'\n- NT10: Hmm, is there any NT rule leading to 't10'? Checking the grammar, I don't see any NT symbol that directly produces 't10'. Wait, maybe it's an NT production that eventually leads to 't10' as a combination of other non-terminals. So to have t10 in the string, we need a derivation where the symbol eventually produces 't10'.\n\nBut looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any NT producing 't10' directly, and I'm trying to see if any combination of symbols can produce 't10' by further splitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string starts with 't10', so perhaps the leftmost non-terminal is derived into 't10' somehow. Without knowing exactly how, this might be a red flag\u2014perhaps the string isn't generated because a necessary non-terminal isn't present.\n\nWait, but let me step back. Maybe I can use the CYK algorithm to check the string against the grammar. The string is quite long, but if I can outline the steps, I can see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string has a mix of terminals that don't align with the productions. For example, in the string, there are multiple 't5's, 't27's, but also some 't83's and 't84's. Without a clear path through the grammar, it's possible the string isn't generated correctly.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps it's easier to look for specific rules that generate parts of the string. Alternatively, perhaps some terminals don't appear in the grammar, but that's not the case here\u2014they all seem to have corresponding rules.\n\nWait, looking at the string: t10 is the first term. The grammar doesn't directly produce t10, so unless t10 is a result of some derivation from other NT symbols, the string might not be valid. Alternatively, perhaps it's produced as part of a larger split.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t10 isn't directly produced, but through a series of steps. Maybe, for example, an NT symbol expands into another NT symbol that can then produce t10. Let me think.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I don't recall any NT symbol leading to 't10' directly or via a chain. So if the string starts with t10, which cannot be generated directly from the grammar, then the string should return 'No'. But perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps t10 is present in some production. Let me check all NT symbol rules for 't10'. I don't see any, so perhaps the string contains a terminal that isn't present in the grammar's productions, which would make it invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't10' is a typo or misrepresented. But the user provided the string, so assuming it's correct.\n\nTherefore, since the first terminal in the string is 't10', and there's no production in the grammar that directly or indirectly generates 't10' as a terminal, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar. Thus, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-664","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating, but let's try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of either two non-terminals or a single terminal. That makes parsing easier, but here I just need to check if the string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar provided looks pretty extensive, with a bunch of production rules. It's going to take a while, but maybe I can find a pattern or a way to trace the string back to the start symbol.\n\nLet me look at the string I need to evaluate: `t44 t24 t72 t43 t83 t32 t47 t23 t39 t20 t57 t27 t80 t35 t37 t3 t32 t20 t73 t47 t26 t28 t14 t12 t42 t10 t21 t17 t37 t26 t74 t84 t28 t64`.\n\nEach token here is a terminal symbol, I assume, based on the grammar. So every element in the string must be produced directly by some production rule.\n\nGiven the grammar, I need to see if each of these tokens can be derived through the rules, perhaps building a tree or checking if each part can be produced.\n\nLet me start by looking for known terminal symbols. For example, I see 't24', which might have a production like NT24 -> t24, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any production rule where NT24 is a non-terminal. Wait, maybe I'm missing it. Let me scan through the production rules.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see 'NT5 -> NT5 NT2' but that's a production for NT5. Not sure if that's relevant. Wait, no, looking again, actually, the grammar I have is all these rules, and each NT has its own production. Hmm, no, the way it's presented, each line is a production for the non-terminal on the left. So if I'm looking for, say, 't24', maybe I can find which non-terminal, when expanded, can produce 't24' directly.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see for example:\n\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT9 -> 't43'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nand so on.\n\nWait, so some of the non-terminals directly produce these 't' tokens. So 't24' would come from some NT. Let me go through each token and see where they can come from.\n\nWait, but going through each token one by one might take a long time. Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards from the string and check if each production step is valid.\n\nAnother approach is to model the string as a series of terminals, and each step in the string corresponds to a step in the derivation starting from S. The goal is to go from S to the string, expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the grammar. Each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each step in the derivation either consumes a terminal or splits into two non-terminals. Since the string is the result of successive productions, the length of the string can give me an idea about how many steps the derivation took.\n\nIn many cases, the number of symbols in the string should be of the form 2^n, but here it's a long string with 41 symbols. Wait, starting from S, each non-terminal can produce two non-terminals, so each step can increase the number of symbols. But the actual count depends on which productions are taken.\n\nBut rather than getting bogged down in the length, I should focus on each token and see if they can be produced by some rule.\n\nLet me try to see a few examples.\n\nThe string starts with 't44'. Looking at the grammar, I don't see any production for NT44 listed. Wait, but maybe it's derived via another path. Or perhaps it's a typo, but no, I have to go with the given grammar.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see that NT27 is 't27' (from NT5 -> 't27'), and NT44 is produced by? Let me check the rules again. Looking through the rules:\n\nNT4 -> t37\nWait, no, in the list, NT4 has several productions, such as NT4 -> NT8 NT6, etc. But I don't see an NT4 -> 't44' or anything directly. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check that the grammar includes 't44' somewhere. If I don't see a production rule, then perhaps the token 't44' isn't part of the language, meaning the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nBut let me double-check the list of rules. scrolling through the list:\n\nLooking for 't44' in all the right-hand sides:\n\nI don't see any production that directly produces 't44'. For example, is there a NT44 in the rules? Or perhaps a rule where NT44 is a terminal?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mislooking. Maybe the notation is such that the tokens are the end symbols, so non-terminals can only be left, but it's possible that some non-terminal produces a 't' token directly.\n\nLooking at the grammar, let's find all the terminal symbols. For instance:\n\nNT3 -> 't72' \u2192 3 \u2192 t72\nNT7 -> 't13' \u21927 \u2192 t13\nNT5-> 't47' \u2192 5\u2192t47\nNT6-> 't83' \u21926\u2192t83\nNT8-> 't5' etc.\n\nWait, but I don't see any directly producing 't44'. So if the grammar doesn't have a rule that directly produces 't44' from a single non-terminal, it's impossible to have 't44' in the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe 't44' is a result of expanding some non-terminal, but from the rules I'm given, I don't see any NT that produces 't44' directly, and none that could produce it through other rules.\n\nSo perhaps the string is not in the language generated by the grammar because there's a 't44' that can't be derived from any rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string is not correctly parsed because some of the tokens after 't44' don't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

{"custom_id":"request-683","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but the grammar is quite extensive, with many non-terminals and productions. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a context-free grammar in CNF looks like. CNF is a form where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except that the start symbol can go to a terminal. Additionally, the rhs must have two non-terminals. Wait, no, actually, the start symbol might have a production where the rhs is a single terminal or a single non-terminal. Hmm, but according to the productions given, it seems like the start symbol S has multiple productions, all breaking into two non-terminals. Looking at the grammar:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\nNT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n...\nOther productions are like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, etc., and eventually, many NTs have productions that go down to terminals. So it's a typical CNF grammar where each rule is two non-terminals, and the non-terminals eventually resolve to terminals.\n\nNow, the string to check is: `t64 t53 t81 t39 t13 t15 t60 t84 t81 t84 t7 t13 t21 t74 t10 t13 t11 t14 t21 t51 t81 t17 t22 t12 t54 t73 t77 t73 t83 t74 t3 t52 t57 t83 t63`.\n\nThis is a list of terminals, each presumably corresponding to a single symbol from the grammar. Each production is a step that produces two terminal symbols, so each terminal symbol would come from a production that terminates at a terminal.\n\nTo check if the string is generated, I can try to parse it using the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a shift-reduce parser would be suitable. Alternatively, checking if the derivation can be formed by applying productions step by step.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long and the grammar is extensive, maybe I can do this by checking whether each pair of symbols in the string (since each production in CNF generates two symbols) can be matched by the productions of the non-terminals.\n\nBut first, the length of the string should be considered. Since the start symbol S produces two non-terminals, the string length should be 2^n, where n is the number of parsing steps. However, in this case, the string length is 36 symbols. Let's check if it's a power of 2: 2^5=32, 2^6=64. 36 is not a power of 2, which suggests that maybe it's not generated by the grammar. But that's just a heuristic\u2014whether the length is a power of 2 could indicate it's possible, but not certain.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production is A\u2192BC, so each step replaces a non-terminal with two symbols. So the initial step starting with S would produce two symbols. Then each of those can produce two each, leading to four, then eight, etc. So the total number of symbols generated after n steps would be 2^n, which must be a power of two. Therefore, if the string has a length that's not a power of two, it's impossible.\n\nWait, the string here has 36 symbols. Let's check if 36 is a power of two. 2^5 is 32, 2^6 is 64. So 36 is not a power of two, which would imply that it's impossible for the grammar to generate a string of length 36. Therefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has a length of 36, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols in any derived string must be a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-679","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, CFDs, right. The string I need to check is \"t7 t23 t76 t31 t56 t31 t74 t83 t81 t53 t21 t73 t2 t14 t79 t21 t60 t23 t33 t70 t80 t79 t51 t39 t26 t70 t37 t70 t53 t14 t27 t60 t28 t83 t79\". Wow, that's a long string with multiple tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, let me think about the grammar provided. It seems pretty extensive, but I should note that it's in CNF, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal. Also, Chomsky Normal Form doesn't have the start symbol on the right side as in some other forms, so S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which makes sense.\n\nI need to figure out if the given string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions. The string has 37 tokens, all 't' followed by numbers. Each of these is a terminal, right? So each of these 'tX' could correspond to some production that terminates in a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, each non-terminal has multiple productions, each either splitting into two non-terminals or terminating in a terminal. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 or NT0 \u2192 NT74 (I think I'm mixing up some of the more complex ones). Hmm, maybe I should list all the non-terminals and their possible productions, but that seems tedious.\n\nBut perhaps I don't need to build the entire parse tree. Maybe I can work step by step, trying to parse the string using the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me start by looking at the structure of the string. It starts with t7, then t23, t76, etc. So I need to see how each of these can be generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', NT5 \u2192 't47', and so on.\n\nWait, let's see the production rules that produce terminals. For instance:\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\nAnd more.\n\nBut I should check how each token in the string can be generated. Let me take each token and see if it's present in any non-terminal productions. For example:\n\nt7: Looking at the grammar, NT4 \u2192 't32', but maybe NT3\u2192't72' which ends with t2? Hmm, not directly. Wait, NT7 has a production to 't13' and 't76'. Wait, looking back: NT7 has the rule \u2192 NT13, I think. Wait, no, I need to check the grammar correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the grammar. Let's go line by line:\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nThen each line like NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2, and so on. The grammar seems very extensive with many non-terminals and production rules. So each non-terminal can produce multiple things, some non-terminals and some terminals.\n\nLet me list all the terminals in the string and see for each if there's a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nThe terminals in the string are:\nt7, t23, t76, t31, t56, t31, t74, t83, t81, t53, t21, t73, t2, t14, t79, t21, t60, t23, t33, t70, t80, t79, t51, t39, t26, t70, t37, t70, t53, t14, t27, t60, t28, t83, t79.\n\nSo that's 37 tokens. Each of these is a terminal, so they must come from some non-terminal that has that production.\n\nLooking for each:\n\nt7: NT7 can produce 't72' (from NT7\u2192't72') or other combinations, but perhaps in the production rules, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check the grammar for each terminal. For example:\n\n- t7: Looking for a non-terminal that has 't7' as a production. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't13' and others. Wait, in the grammar earlier, I see NT7 \u2192 't13', but maybe there's another NT that produces t7.\n\nWait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n\nBut do any non-terminals produce 't7'? Let's check each line for terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\nWait, this might be an issue. The user input had lines like:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT2 -> 't7'\nYes, in the grammar, NT2 is defined as \u2192 't7'. So t7 comes from NT2. So the first token t7 must be generated from NT2. That means the top-level non-terminal S must derive a sequence that includes NT2.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So if we can derive a string where one of the paths produces NT2 as part of the sequence, that's a start.\n\nWait, the first token is t7, which is generated by NT2. So the first production from S is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So from NT0 and NT4, we need to derive sequences leading to t7 and something else.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is to build the parse tree bottom-up. But that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nWait, let me note that each step, when a non-terminal is replaced by two symbols, those can be further broken down until all terminals are reached.\n\nAlternatively, since this is a tree, the string is a leftmost or rightmost derivation, but I'm not sure which, but perhaps it's a top-down approach.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find the sequence.\n\nThe string starts with t7, which is NT2. So to have nt2, we have to have S produce components that include NT2. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, maybe one of the non-terminals (NT0 or NT4) can produce the rest of the string after t7.\n\nWait, but the string is t7 followed by t23, t76, etc. So perhaps t7 is the first element generated by NT2, then the rest is generated by some expansion of NT0 or NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is generated by a single NT, but given that S \u2192 NT0 NT4, that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string can be generated by NT0 and NT4 combined.\n\nHmm, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the first token is t7, which is from NT2.\n\nBut S is NT0 and NT4. How can NT0 or NT4 produce t7?\n\nLooking through the grammar, does NT0 or NT4 have a production that includes NT2? Not directly, unless their productions include combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the overall string is built in a way that starts with t7, then t23 (which is NT0), then t76 (NT7), etc. But that might get complicated.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to list, for each non-terminal, the possible terminals they can produce.\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\n- NT0 can produce:\n  - 't23'\n  - 't74'\n  - etc., but looking through the rules, NT0 has:\n    NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n    etc. Hmm, so maybe NT0 can via some steps produce t23, but t23 is from NT0 as well.\n\nWait, let me check all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each symbol on the right side has at most two non-terminals, which simplifies things a bit.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t53 t8 t11 t84 t83 t61 t69 t61 t42 t3 t83 t79 t73 t74 t67 t79 t69 t74 t60 t31 t21 t35 t32 t72 t77 t12 t51 t47 t43 t33 t10 t67 t35 t52 t79 t3.\n\nI see that the string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers. Looking at the grammar, I notice that many of these 't' sequences are terminals, meaning they are directly part of the productions. So, to generate this string, the non-terminals must be expanded step by step to form the terminals.\n\nI'll start by checking if the start symbol S can produce this string. The start symbol S is in the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the entire string must be generated by expanding NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 and NT4 have their own productions. Let's see what NT0 can produce. NT0 is in several productions, such as NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. Similarly, NT4 is involved in more productions like NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nGiven the complexity, I should probably see if the string can be built by following the rules. Let's start by trying to split the string into parts that correspond to the possible productions.\n\nThe first part is t53 t8 t11 t84. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT8 can produce t84 via NT8 \u2192 t84. So, t84 could be from NT8. Then, t11 is produced by NT6 \u2192 t11. Similarly, t53 is from NT3 \u2192 t53. So maybe the first few symbols are part of a NT3 NT8 NT6 structure.\n\nWait, but NT8 can produce t84 directly. Then, if we have NT8 \u2192 t84, followed by NT11 (which is 't11'), that's part of NT6's production. Hmm, maybe the initial part is produced by NT3 NT8, and each can split further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to trace back from the string. The last symbol is 't3', which is part of NT3 \u2192 t3. So let's see how t3 can be generated. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT3 has productions like NT3 \u2192 t72, NT3 \u2192 t53, etc. Wait, there's a production NT3 \u2192 t3 which is 't3' as a terminal, so 't3' can be directly produced by NT3. That's one possibility. But looking further, we might have more 't's before that.\n\nLet me try to approach this by building the string step by step:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\n2. So the string starts with what NT0 can produce and ends with what NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT0, it can go to NT6 NT7. NT6 can produce NT7 and NT0. Let's see what NT6 can do. NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9 or NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0, etc. Wait, NT6 can produce several combinations.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see the overall structure. The string is a sequence of tXY, and I need to see if each can be traced back to a production in the grammar.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the productions that can generate the terminals in order. Let's check if each part can be built by the grammar.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\nt53: Looking at the grammar, 't53' is an option for NT3 \u2192 't53'. So maybe the first part of the string is from NT3.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I see NT3 has multiple productions. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', NT3 \u2192 't53', etc. So perhaps the first symbol t53 comes from NT3.\n\nThen, after t53, the next is t8. So after t53, we have t8. Let's see how that can be formed. If t53 is NT3, then the next symbol must be generated by NT3's next step.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: If NT3 can produce another NT3, for example, NT3 \u2192 T53, maybe that could be a split, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial part is formed by a combination of NT sequences leading to these terminals.\n\nThis seems too complicated, perhaps I should look for known parsers or methods to determine this, but since I'm doing it manually, maybe another approach would be to consider the grammar structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should notice that the grammar may have multiple ways to generate t's, so let me try to see if the string can be parsed by backtracking through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for any obvious contradictions or impossibilities. For example, does any terminal in the string not appear as a terminal in any NT production?\n\nLooking at the grammar, the terminals are combinations like t53, t84, t83, t61, etc. I need to check if all these tXY exist as terminal productions.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, I'm seeing that several of these t's are directly produced as terminals. For example, 't53' is directly produced by NT3, 't84' by NT8, 't83' by NT8 (from 't3' perhaps?), wait, wait, no\u2014looking at the grammar, I need to check the productions that result in 't' sequences.\n\nLooking again, I notice that NT6 \u2192 't83', NT3 \u2192 't72', NT3 \u2192 't53', and so on. So each 'tXY' must be a terminal that is directly produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't53' which is directly from NT3. The next is 't8'\u2014looking at the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't84' and NT8 \u2192 't8' isn't present, so maybe 't8' comes from elsewhere. Wait, looking through the productions, I don't see NT8 \u2192 't8'. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the production NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9 and others. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 has several productions, including NT3 \u2192 't72' (if that's the case), but also NT3 \u2192 't53'.\n\nWait, checking the given grammar:\n\nLooking for any production where a non-terminal directly expands to a single 't' like 't53'.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking for any 't' that is directly a production of an NT:\n\nYes, for example:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\n\nNT3 -> 't53'\n\nNT3 -> 't31'\n\nNT3 -> 't33'\n\nSimilarly, NT8 -> 't84'\n\nNT6 -> 't83'\n\nWait, but not every 'tXY' is a terminal\u2014it depends on whether the NT can produce it. So for 't8' to be a terminal, it must be directly produced by some NT.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I don't see any production where an NT directly produces 't8'. For example, do any of the NTs have a production like NT3 \u2192 't8'? No, the closest is NT3 \u2192 't53', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nSo maybe some of the terms in the string rely on non-terminals that can't be reduced further, which would mean the string isn't generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that, perhaps 't8' is impossible because there's no NT that directly produces 't8'. So if the string has 't8' as a terminal, and no NT can directly produce it, that would mean the string isn't possible. \n\nBut looking back, the first few symbols are t53, t8, t11, etc. If 't8' isn't directly produced by any NT, that would be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check the entire list of terminals in the string again to see if any of them cannot be directly produced by an NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar, 't3', 't4', etc., are terminals. So, for example:\n\n- 't3' \u2192 NT3 \u2192 't3' (yes, exists)\n- 't8' \u2192 must it arise from some NT? It's not directly produced by any NT in the given productions. Wait, does any NT have a production ending in 't8'?

Hmm, I remember that CNF has a specific structure where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol.\n\nFirst, let me look at the provided grammar. It seems quite extensive with multiple non-terminals leading to various terminals like 't17', 't8', etc. The string to evaluate is: `t17 t8 t73 t11 t52 t17 t67 t35 t10 t15 t52 t12 t83 t60 t79 t31 t17 t9 t24 t35 t21 t7 t44 t39 t10 t7 t9 t83 t32 t64 t56 t13 t35 t15 t69 t5`. \n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the grammar. Since the string consists of terminals, I'll need to map each terminal to the appropriate non-terminal production.\n\nLet me go through the string step by step and see if each terminal can be matched by the productions. Starting from the beginning:\n\n1. `t17`: Looking at the grammar, I see that NT7 \u2192 t17 because in the rules, NT7->'t17'. So the first symbol matches.\n\n2. `t8`: Now, I need a production that leads to 't8'. Looking through the non-terminals, I see NT4 \u2192 't8' and NT3 \u2192 't8', among others. Let's see. The current position is after t17, so we need to see what produced t17 and then t8.\n\nLooking back, NT7 \u2192 t17, which came from NT7's production. So the step after t17 could be part of NT7 or another rule. Wait, but in the string, after t17 comes t8. So perhaps NT7 produced t17, and from another rule, NT7 can produce something that leads to t17 and t8. I might need to track this.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building the parse tree from the start symbol S, expanding it step by step to see if it can derive the string. But that might take a while. Alternatively, I can try to check each part of the string to see if the production rules allow it.\n\nLet me list the possible non-terminals and their terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar, the non-terminals and their productions ending in terminals include:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t23, t28, t43, etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 t17, t54, t43\n- NT5 \u2192 t3, t10, t13, etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 t77, t11, t60, etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 t11, t5, t56, etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 t2, t72, t76, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 t42, etc.\n- And many others.\n\nI can make a list of all the non-terminals and which terminals they can produce:\n\n- NT7: t17, t54, t43\n- NT0: t23, t28, t43, etc.\n- NT5: t3, t10, t13, etc.\n- NT6: t77, t11, t7, etc.\n- NT8: t11, t5, t56, etc.\n- NT3: t2, t72, t76, etc.\n- NT4: t42, etc.\n- And so on for each non-terminal.\n\nNow, let's go through the string:\n\n1. t17: This must come from NT7 \u2192 t17. So the first rule is NT7 \u2192 t17.\n\n2. t8: After t17, the next symbol is t8. Now, looking at NT7's productions, it can produce t17, but does it have any production that leads to t8? From the list above, I don't see NT7 producing t8. The only productions for NT7 are t17, t54, t43. So after producing t17, how can we get t8? This seems problematic because NT7 can't produce t8. \n\nWait, unless t8 comes from another non-terminal. So perhaps the production is different. Maybe it's a combination of NT8 \u2192 t8, but how would that fit?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first part of the string comes from a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see:\n\nThe string is: t17 t8 t73 t11 t52 t17 t67 t35 t10 t15 t52 t12 t83 t60 t79 t31 t17 t9 t24 t35 t21 t7 t44 t39 t10 t7 t9 t83 t32 t64 t56 t13 t35 t15 t69 t5.\n\nI have to check if each terminal can be generated by some non-terminal. Let me go step by step.\n\n1. t17: from NT7 \u2192 t17.\n\n2. t8: Now, can any non-terminal produce t8 and be connected via the previous NT7?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial step isn't NT7. Maybe the string starts with NT0, NT6, etc.\n\nLooking back, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S starts with NT0 and NT4. But in the string, the first symbol is t17, which is part of NT7. So perhaps S expands to NT7 and something else.\n\nWait, but S is NT0 NT4, which might expand further.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to parse from the beginning.\n\nWait, perhaps the string can be split into a series of non-terminals that lead to these terminals.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a series of steps:\n\nWe start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two steps are NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut the first term is t17, which must come from NT7. So perhaps NT0 can expand to NT7 and something else.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there's a rule NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. So NT0 can produce NT6 followed by NT7. Then, each of those can produce terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nSo perhaps the string starts with NT6 followed by NT7.\n\nSo first, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nThen, NT6 needs to produce t11 (since the second symbol is t8, but wait, NT6 can produce t11, t7, etc. Let's see.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to break it down more systematically.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, the first node is NT0, which can produce various things. Let's see what the first symbol in the string is: t17. So maybe the first thing NT0 produces is a non-terminal that can generate t17.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nSo if NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then we have NT6 and NT7 to produce the string.\n\nSo the first two symbols would come from NT6 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8,\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0,\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT6.\n\nAlso, NT6 can produce terminals like t77, t11, t7, etc.\n\nSo for the first symbol t17, that would have to come from NT7 \u2192 t17. So maybe after NT6, we have NT7 \u2192 t17.\n\nWait, that can't be because after NT6 comes NT7, but in that case, the first two symbols might be from NT6 and NT7.\n\nWait, but if the string starts with t17, perhaps that comes directly from NT7, which is part of NT0's production.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it this way: NT0 can produce NT6 NT7, so the first part of the string would be the expansion of NT6 followed by NT7.\n\nSo if the string starts with t17, that would have to come from NT7, meaning that NT7 is part of the NT6 expansion.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8,\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0,\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT6.\n\nBut none of these directly produce t17.

The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: `t57 t28 t14 t54 t63 t33 t40 t9 t56 t53 t10 t56 t31 t26 t24 t61 t8 t42 t43 t60 t37 t17 t73 t12 t40 t70 t8 t12 t42 t21 t22 t23 t83 t24 t15 t5 t26`.\n\nMy initial thought is to model the parsing process, probably using a method like memoization or recursive descent, but since the grammar is given, I can also analyze it for possible patterns or see if the string can be broken down according to the production rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the start symbol, which is S. The production for S is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string must start with NT0 and followed by NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t57, so NT0 must produce t57. Let me check the productions for NT0. From the rules, NT0 can produce multiple things, including t23, t28, t35, etc. But one of them is NT6 NT7 and NT9 NT7. Wait, looking closer, I see rules like NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, which leads to more terminal productions.\n\nWait, actually, looking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Oh, I see multiple entries for NT0. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (from a different part), and others. Also, from the end of the given grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't23', which is directly producing the terminal t23.\n\nSo, if NT0 is to produce t57, but looking at the productions, NT0 doesn't directly produce t57. Instead, NT0 goes through a series of steps, like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then maybe NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, etc. So t57 must come from a non-terminal that eventually leads to t57.\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I see NT7. The production NT7 \u2192 't54' and also NT7 \u2192 other non-terminals. Let me see if any NT leads to t57.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first term is t57, so it must be the result of a production that eventually ends with t57. Let me look at the options for NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then, NT6 can produce NT7 NT9 or other non-terminals, but none of the non-terminals directly produce t57. So perhaps t57 comes from another path. Wait, maybe from NT5 or NT4.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT4 \u2192 't57' is one of its productions. Yes, in the last part of the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't57'\n\nSo, if NT4 can directly produce t57, that's a possibility. Similarly, NT7 can produce t54, but not t57. So maybe S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and the NT4 could directly produce t57.\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then the string must start with NT0 producing something that starts the string with t57, and NT4 producing the rest.\n\nBut let me think step by step. The string starts with t57, so the first part must come from a production that results in t57. Looking at the productions, the non-terminals that directly produce t57 are NT4 and possibly others. Wait, from the grammar:\n\nLooking at the end, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't57'\n\nYes, that's direct. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4, with NT4 directly producing t57. That would mean the first part is t57, starting the string with t57.\n\nBut wait, that would mean the string starts with t57, but let me check the start production again. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the left-hand side is S, which expands into NT0 and NT4. The NT4 here would be the NT4, which can produce t57. But wait, perhaps NT0 also can produce something that connects with NT4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let's consider that S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, the entire string must be a valid derivation starting from NT0 followed by NT4.\n\nSo, the first part is NT0, which must produce the first few symbols, and then NT4 must produce the rest, including t57 as the first symbol.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t57, which is the output of NT4. So that would mean NT4 \u2192 t57. But according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, S would derive NT0 followed by (something NT4 producing t57). That would require that NT4 can produce t57, but NT4 is a non-terminal, it can produce t57 as a terminal, but that would mean the production is terminal. Wait, no\u2014Non-terminals can't produce terminals directly in all cases. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form only allows non-terminals producing other non-terminals or terminals. So a production like NT4 \u2192 t57 would allow it to produce the terminal symbol t57.\n\nSo, if the string starts with t57, then NT4 must directly produce t57. So, in the derivation, the second part (after NT0) is NT4 \u2192 t57. So the string starts with t57, which is the first symbol, and then the rest is generated by NT0 and the rest of NT4.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. Let me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t57 t28 t14 t54 t63 t33 t40 t9 t56 t53 t10 t56 t31 t26 t24 t61 t8 t42 t43 t60 t37 t17 t73 t12 t40 t70 t8 t12 t42 t21 t22 t23 t83 t24 t15 t5 t26.\n\nLet me list the tokens in order:\n\n1: t57\n\n2: t28\n\n3: t14\n\n4: t54\n\n5: t63\n\n6: t33\n\n7: t40\n\n8: t9\n\n9: t56\n\n10: t53\n\n11: t10\n\n12: t56\n\n13: t31\n\n14: t26\n\n15: t24\n\n16: t61\n\n17: t8\n\n18: t42\n\n19: t43\n\n20: t60\n\n21: t37\n\n22: t17\n\n23: t73\n\n24: t12\n\n25: t40\n\n26: t70\n\n27: t8\n\n28: t12\n\n29: t42\n\n30: t21\n\n31: t22\n\n32: t23\n\n33: t83\n\n34: t24\n\n35: t15\n\n36: t5\n\n37: t26\n\nWait, the string has 37 tokens. Let me try to see how S \u2192 NT0 NT4 can produce this. So, the entire string starts with NT0 and then NT4.\n\nBut the first token is t57, which is the result of NT4 \u2192 t57. So, the first part of the string (t57) comes from NT4, and then what comes before NT4 must end with NT0 producing the rest.\n\nWait, no, the production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the entire string must be NT0 followed by NT4. So the string is the concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT4's derivation. So the first symbols must be generated by NT0, and the symbols after that by NT4. So the first token (t57) must come from NT4.\n\nBut NT4 \u2192 t57 is a possible production. So the first symbol t57 is from NT4, and the rest of the string (from position 2 onwards) must be generated by NT0. Wait, no, because the production is NT0 followed by NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-712","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is given in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure, making it easier to analyze. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's a set of production rules where each non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side produces two non-terminals on the right. The start symbol is S, which produces NT0 and NT4. From there, the string generation works by expanding these non-terminals until we reach terminal symbols, which are the 't' followed by numbers like 't72', 't26', etc.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t72 t26 t24 t63 t67 t21 t76 t43 t23 t27 t79 t12 t20 t32 t33 t79 t76 t72 t63 t15 t56 t21 t51 t11 t81 t42 t13 t42 t70 t47 t10 t28 t26 t79 t5 t15 t13`. \n\nI notice that the string starts with a series of 't' symbols followed by numbers. Each of these could be either a terminal or part of a non-terminal expansion. My goal is to see if this entire sequence can be derived from S by applying the production rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have productions that produce terminal symbols. For example, NT3 -> 't72', which is one of the first symbols in the string, 't72'. Similarly, other non-terminals expand into specific 't' symbols. So, some of these are straightforward.\n\nHowever, other symbols like NT7 produce other non-terminals. For instance, NT7 can produce NT4 and NT0, which themselves might produce more non-terminals or end in a 't' symbol.\n\nSo, I'll try to break down the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals as needed. Starting from S -> NT0 NT4, the string should have two parts derived from NT0 and NT4 respectively, or more if there are multiple derivations.\n\nWait, actually, no, S directly expands into NT0 and NT4, but in the string, it's a linear sequence, so each production step should match the sequence correctly. So each 't' in the string must come from either the terminal productions of the non-terminals or as a result of an expansion.\n\nThis might get complicated, so maybe I should start from the beginning and try to match the string step by step, expanding the non-terminals as I go. Let's list out the string again:\n\n1. t72\n2. t26\n3. t24\n4. t63\n5. t67\n6. t21\n7. t76\n8. t43\n9. t23\n10. t27\n11. t79\n12. t12\n13. t20\n14. t32\n15. t33\n16. t79\n17. t76\n18. t72\n19. t63\n20. t15\n21. t56\n22. t21\n23. t51\n24. t11\n25. t81\n26. t42\n27. t13\n28. t42\n29. t70\n30. t47\n31. t10\n32. t28\n33. t26\n34. t79\n35. t5\n36. t15\n37. t13\n\nThat's a lot of symbols. Let's see which of these correspond to terminal symbols in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the non-terminals, some end with 't', like NT0 -> 't23', NT7 -> 't13', etc. So each of these is a terminal. So any symbol in the string that is a 't' followed by numbers that appear on the right-hand side of a production rule could be a terminal.\n\nLet me map out the possible terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' \u2192 so if any part starts with 't23', that's a terminal.\n- NT5 -> 't47' \u2192 't47'.\n- NT7 -> 't13' \u2192 't13'.\n- NT4 -> 't13' \u2192 't13'.\n- NT6 -> 't63' \u2192 't63'.\n- NT8 -> 't5' \u2192 't5'.\n- NT3 -> 't72' \u2192 't72'.\n- NT4 -> 't51' \u2192 't51'.\n- NT0 -> 't52' \u2192 Hmm, wait, no. Checking the grammar, I see some rules. Wait, let's go through the definitions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, some non-terminals have exactly one terminal:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't63'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT3 -> 't33' (another rule)\n- NT0 -> 't52' (another rule)\n- NT4 -> 't32' (rule)\n- NT0 -> 't43' (another rule)\n- NT5 -> 't3' (rule)\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT7 -> 't54'\n- NT8 -> 't5' (another rule)\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT8 -> 't84' (multiple rules)\n- Others like NT2 and NT9 also expand into 't's or further non-terminals.\n\nSo, the string has terms like 't26', 't24', etc. I need to check if any of these appear in the terminal productions. \n\nLooking at the grammar, let's list all terminal symbols:\n\n NT3:\n- 't72'\n- 't33' (another production)\n- 't53'\n\n NT5:\n- 't47'\n- 't3'\n\n NT7:\n- 't13'\n- 't54'\n\n NT6:\n- 't63'\n- 't77'\n- 't43' (from multiple productions)\nWait, no, NT6's productions are:\n\n NT6:\n- NT7 NT9 (multiple rules)\n Wait, actually, looking back: the grammar has many rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT6 is defined as:\n\n NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n NT6 -> NT9 NT8\n NT6 -> NT7 NT0\n\nWait, no, looking at the provided rules, let me see:\n\nThe grammar includes numerous rules, some of which are:\n\nNT6:\n- NT7 NT9 (line: NT6 -> NT7 NT9)\n- NT9 NT8 (line: NT6 -> NT9 NT8)\n- NT7 NT0 (line: NT6 -> NT7 NT0)\n\nHmm, wait, but none of these have 't' as terminal; instead, all these are non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me check the grammar again carefully.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT0 has several productions, some lead to terminals:\n\nNT0:\n- NT6 NT7 (multiple rules)\n- NT5 NT5\n- NT9 NT7\n- NT4 NT5\n- NT5 NT6\n- NT0 NT8\n- etc.\n\nBut none of NT0's directly produce 't's. Looking through other non-terminals:\n\nNT3:\n- 't72' (rule)\n- 't33' (another rule)\n- 't53' (another rule)\n\nYes, so NT3 has 't72' as a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT5 has 't47' and 't3'.\n\nNT7 has 't13' and 't54'.\n\nNT6:\n- NT7 NT9\n- NT9 NT8\n- NT7 NT0\n\nNo, none of these produce 't's, they produce non-terminals. So, when NT6 is used, it leads into more expansions.\n\nSimilarly, NT2 has a production to 't7'.\n\nNT2 -> 't7'\n\nSo, 't7' is a terminal.

So both options for S start with NT0 and NT4.\n\nI think parsing from the top might not be straightforward, so perhaps I'll try to see if each step in the string can be derived by looking at the grammar rules.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't2'. So I need to see if there's a production for 't2' or if it's derived through other rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see entries like NT2 -> 't7' and NT2 -> other NTs. Wait, looking more carefully, some of the NTs produce 'tX' where X varies. So perhaps 't2' corresponds to a certain NT rule.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't7', NT2 -> NT3 NT2, NT2 -> NT7 NT2, NT2 -> NT9 NT2, etc. Wait, no, actually, let me look again. The NT2 rules are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7' (line 2)\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT6 (line 8)\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT2 (line 12)\n- NT2 -> NT9 NT2 (line 16)\n- NT2 -> NT0 NT2 (line 22)\n- NT2 -> NT2 NT9 (line 26)\nSo, how do we get 't2'? Hmm, in my initial glance, I don't see 't2' as an explicit terminal in NT2. Wait, let me check all the NTs for 't2'.\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7' (line 2)\nWait, that's 't7'. Oh, I see other 'tX' terms, like t51, t57, etc. So perhaps 't2' is not one of the terminals in the grammar. But let me check all the terminals.\n\nLooking through each NT production, the terminals are:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't51', 't53', 't72', 't76', 't8', 't24', etc.\n- NT5 -> 't47', 't33', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't13', 't43', etc.\n- NT0 -> various 'tX's.\n- NT4 -> several 'tX's.\n- NT6, NT8, etc., have various 'tX's.\n\nWait, 't2' might not be present in the grammar. That's a problem because the string contains 't2', which would mean it's derived from an NT that produces 't2', but if none of the NT productions directly yield 't2', then it's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the NT definitions have a typo or I missed it.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a rule. Let's scan all the NT rules to see if any produce 't2'. Scanning each line:\n\nLooking for NT2 -> 't2'... I don't see it anywhere. So NT2's productions are all either to terminals like 't7' or to combinations of other NTs.\n\nSo if the string starts with 't2', and NT2's only terminal is 't7', then how could that happen? Unless 't2' is an error, but according to the problem statement, the string might or might not be in the language. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parsing the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread. Let me check the grammar again carefully:\n\nLooking at each NT production:\n\n- NT2 is defined as:\n  - NT2 -> NT3 NT6\n  - NT2 -> NT7 NT2\n  - NT2 -> NT9 NT2\n  - NT2 -> NT0 NT2\n  - NT2 -> NT2 NT9\n  - NT2 -> 't7'\n\nSo none of these produce 't2'. Therefore, the string starts with 't2', which suggests either this is impossible, or perhaps 't2' is derived differently. So unless there's a rule that I missed or a typo in the problem, it's impossible for the string to be generated if 't2' is required.\n\nWait, perhaps the 't2' is a typo, but since the user provided it, I have to assume it's correct. So, the problem is that the grammar does not have an NT2 that produces 't2'. All NT2 rules either go to other NTs or 't7'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated because the first symbol 't2' cannot be derived from any production rule in the grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe the NTs correspond differently. For example, maybe 't2' is produced by a different NT. Let me check all NTs for 't2' in the terminal list.\n\nLooking through all terminal productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 has 't23', 't28', 't35', etc., but 't2' is not there.\n- NT5 has 't47', etc.\n- NT7 has 't13', 't43'\n- NT3 has 't51', 't53', 't72', etc., but no 't2'.\n- NT4 has 't37', 't24', etc.\n- NT6 has 't83', 't77', etc.\n- NT8 has 't5', etc.\n- NT9 has 't60' and others.\n\nLooking through all the NT rules, I don't see any that produce 't2' as a terminal. Therefore, 't2' is not part of the language, unless the grammar somehow can derive it from other symbols, but since all the NT2 rules go to 't7' or combinations, it can't produce 't2' elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it starts with 't2', which is impossible given the production rules.\n\nWait, but wait a minute\u2014perhaps I made a mistake in checking all the NTs. Let me go through each NT and their terminal productions.\n\nLooking for 't2' in all NTs:\n\n- NT0: includes t23, t28, t35, t3, t52, t15, t76, t43, t5, t22, t83, t40, etc. But no 't2'.\n- NT1: Not in the given rules.\n- NT2: 't7' as a terminal. No 't2'.\n- NT3: 't51', 't53', 't72', 't76', 't8', 't24', 't39', 't31', 't8', etc. No 't2'.\n- NT4: 't37', 't24', 't9', 't32', 't27', etc. No 't2'.\n- NT5: multiple 't's, but no 't2'.\n- NT6: 't83', 't77', etc.\n- NT7: 't13', 't43', etc.\n- NT8: 't5', 't32', etc.\n- NT9: 't60', etc.\n- NT15: t10\n- And so on. None of the NTs have 't2' as a terminal symbol.\n\nTherefore, the first symbol 't2' cannot be generated by any rule in the grammar. Therefore, the entire string is invalid as per the grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

But looking at the grammar, the initial symbol 'S' produces NT0 NT4, which seems to be non-terminals, so the grammar is in CNF as per the rules.\n\nEach rule in the grammar ends with a terminal, which indicates that the symbols like t31, t17, etc., are terminals. I need to see if the string can be broken down into these terminals following the grammar rules.\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals. My approach will be to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the rules in the grammar. Since the grammar is context-free, a recursive descent parser or a table-driven parser would work, but manually, it might be a bit challenging. Alternatively, I can try to see if each terminal can be derived from the non-terminals step by step.\n\nLet me list the grammar rules for clarity, focusing on the productions that result in terminals (those ending with terminals). Here are some key ones:\n\n- S -> NT0 NT4\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7 (Also)\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT9\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT3\n- NT3 -> NT0 NT8\n- NT3 -> NT3 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT0 (Also from other rules)\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT2 -> 't14'\n- NT9 -> 't43'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- Others like NT3, NT5, etc., have multiple terminals as well.\n\nI notice that some rules directly produce terminals, so perhaps I can start by looking for these. For example, NT2 -> 't14', which is one of the terminals in the string.\n\nBut to parse the entire string, I think I should consider the structure. Maybe the string can be divided into parts that correspond to productions starting with 't' as the result of some non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, I can try to split it into chunks that match the possible non-terminals. However, without knowing the exact sequences, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the string has a structure that follows the grammar's productions.\n\nAnother approach is to see which non-terminals can derive a 't' followed by some letters. For example, looking at the grammar, NT2 produces 't14', NT3 might produce a longer string, and so on. However, in the given string, we have individual 't's followed by numbers, like 't31', 't17', etc., so perhaps each corresponds to a non-terminal that expands into that exact term.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the non-terminals expand into other non-terminals and terminals. So, each 't' with a number is a terminal symbol, and each non-terminal like NT3 is a symbol that can expand into other symbols, which can eventually lead to the terminals.\n\nFor the string to be generated, there must be a derivation starting from S and ending up with the given sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be broken down into segments that match the possible derivatives from the start symbol S.\n\nStarting from S: S -> NT0 NT4\n\nSo, the start symbol expands into NT0 and NT4. Each of these can further expand.\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7 or NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6 or NT4 -> NT4 NT3 or NT4 -> NT5 NT2 or NT4 -> NT8 NT7 (Wait, looking at the rules, it's: NT4 -> NT8 NT6, NT4 -> NT4 NT3, NT4 -> NT5 NT2, and also NT4 -> NT4 NT3 again? Or perhaps that's a typo. Looking back, I see multiple entries for NT4. For example, NT4 -> NT8 NT6, NT4 -> NT4 NT3, NT4 -> NT5 NT2, and it also says NT4 -> NT4 NT3 again, and another entry like NT4 -> NT3 perhaps. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, in the grammar, the rules for NT4 are:\n\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- Also, I see another rule: NT4 -> NT4 NT3 once more, which might be a mistake. But perhaps it's allowed as a rule, though that would mean it's non-recursive? Or maybe it's a typo and should be different. Hmm, perhaps the grammar has multiple rules for NT4, which is allowed in CNF as long as each rule is two non-terminals.\n\nBut regardless, looking for rules that produce NT4 or other high-level symbols.\n\nSo, the initial expansion S -> NT0 NT4. So, the first part is NT0 and the second is NT4.\n\nI need to see if the string can be constructed by deriving sequences from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t31 t17 t51 t10 t3 t80 t21 t44 t47 t80 t69 t22 t80 t3 t40 t11 t60 t79 t17 t35 t64 t5 t42 t3 t42 t3 t53 t57 t69 t27 t21 t64 t37 t8 t12 t67 t69 t83.\n\nThis is a list of 33 't' terms. Let me try to split this into parts that might match the production rules.\n\nStarting with the first symbol, 't31'. Let's see which non-terminals can produce 't31'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NT rules that produce 't31' would need to have a rule that directly expands to 't31'. Scanning through, I don't see any direct rule for any NT symbol that produces 't31'. So, perhaps 't31' is derived from a longer sequence of symbols, ultimately expanding to that terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't31' is part of a larger expansion. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to map which symbols can derive which sequences and see if the string can be constructed accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe looking for the start symbol's expansions and see if the string can be broken down into those parts.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT0 NT4. So, the string should start with the expansion of NT0 followed by the expansion of NT4.\n\nLet me check the string's first few symbols. The first two are 't31' and 't17'.\n\nLooking at NT0 and NT4's possible expansions:\n\nNT0 can expand into NT6 NT7 or NT0 NT9, etc. So, the expansion for NT0 might start with certain non-terminals. Similarly, NT4 can expand into NT8 NT6 or NT4 NT3, etc.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe it's better to check if all symbols are present in the grammar. The string contains t31, t17, t51, t10, t3, etc. I need to check if all these symbols are present in the grammar as either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, the terminal symbols are all the ones that end with a number, like 't31', 't17', etc. The rest are non-terminals, e.g., NT0, NT1, etc.\n\nBut in the grammar given, none of the production rules directly correspond to 't31' as a result of a single non-terminal. So, 't31' must be part of a longer expansion from a non-terminal.\n\nBut without a rule that directly expands to 't31', it's impossible to generate that terminal.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, all production rules are either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which initially produces NT0 NT4, as per the rule S -> NT0 NT4. So, the initial parse is going to involve these non-terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't53', 't62', etc. These are terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can generate these in the correct order.\n\nI think the best approach is to simulate the parsing process. That is, start with the start symbol S, apply the production rules step by step, and see if we can end up with the given string.\n\nBut given the complexity of the grammar, with many non-terminals and production rules, manually expanding the parse tree for the entire string would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, perhaps I can look for the production rules that could generate each of these 't' symbols.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that each 't' corresponds to a terminal symbol, and each terminal is produced by exactly one production rule. For example, 't43' appears several times and is produced by NT6 and several others.\n\nI should check if each 't' in the string is covered by some production rule. Since the string has tokens like 't53', which seems specific, I can check if NT53 is a production or if there's a non-terminal that can directly produce 't53'.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar, I notice that some rules have 't' as their right-hand side, like NT0 -> 't23', etc. However, not all terminals are covered as far as I can see.\n\nLet me list the terminal productions in the grammar:\n\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT9 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't33'\n- NT4 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't54'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't60'\n- NT4 -> 't84'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT8 -> 't84'\n- NT8 -> 't81'\n- NT0 -> 't28'\n- NT4 -> 't7'\n- NT4 -> 't27'\n- NT0 -> 't62'\n- NT2 -> 't26'\n- NT9 -> 't44'\n- NT5 -> 't15'\n- NT7 -> 't33'\n- NT8 -> 't64'\n- NT6 -> 't77'\n- NT8 -> 't56'\n- NT3 -> 't2'\n- NT8 -> 't73'\n- NT7 -> 't76'\n- NT6 -> 't61'\n- NT2 -> 't53'\n- NT3 -> 't69'\n- NT4 -> 't70'\n- NT0 -> 't12'\n- NT9 -> 't20'\n- NT7 -> 't57'\n- NT7 -> 't7'\n- NT8 -> 't57'\n- NT2 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't79'\n- NT8 -> 't53'\n- NT8 -> 't22'\n- NT6 -> 't8'\n- NT0 -> 't80'\n- NT4 -> 't51'\n- NT4 -> 't13'\n- NT5 -> 't62'\n- NT3 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't17'\n- NT4 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't40'\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't52'\n- NT7 -> 't70'\n- NT6 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't35'\n- NT6 -> 't67'\n- NT8 -> 't77'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n\nHmm, so each terminal in the string corresponds to a specific rule. For example, 't53' is produced by NT3, 't62' by NT3, 't63' by NT3 (but wait, looking at the rules, NT3 has 't69' as one of its productions, but 't63' is generated by NT3). Wait, looking at the rules for NT3:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT3 is connected to rules that produce 't72', 't39', 't10', etc. Wait, I don't see a production that directly produces 't63'.

So I need to see how 't62' can be produced.\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT6: NT6 can produce 't83', 't61', 't9', 't56', 't77', etc. Wait, maybe looking more precisely.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6:\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT6 -> NT77\nNT6 -> NT4 NT2\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\n...\nLooking for 't62' in NT6 productions:\n\nI don't see 't62' as a direct production of NT6. However, perhaps 't62' is produced indirectly.\n\nLooking back at NT3's rules, is there a production that includes 't62'? Looking through the NT3 rules:\n\nNT3 has 't62' as a production: NT3 -> 't62'\n\nYes, that's in the list. So NT3 can directly produce 't62'.\n\nSo, each terminal in the string must correspond to a direct production rule in the grammar.\n\nLet's go through each token in the string:\n\n1. t53: produced by NT3 (as per NT3->'t53')\n2. t62: produced by NT3 (NT3->'t62')\n3. t63: Look for 't63' in productions.

{"custom_id":"request-747","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this problem where I have to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string provided is quite long and consists of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst, I'll recall what CNF means. In CNF, each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to follow CNF because all productions are either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. That's good because it might make parsing easier.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t77 t44 t10 t7 t64 t57 t60 t39 t15 t11 t10 t72 t3 t21 t51 t27 t64 t51 t26 t64 t39 t42 t2 t67 t62 t67 t5 t10 t84 t24 t13 t35 t63 t42 t10 t3 t64 t43 t9`.\n\nNow, I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. This involves checking if each terminal in the string can be derived through a series of leftmost or rightmost productions starting from the start symbol, which is S.\n\nBut before diving deep, maybe I can look for patterns or common sequences in the grammar that might repeat. Since the grammar is quite extensive with many productions, perhaps the string can be broken down into components that match each production.\n\nHowever, starting from S, the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the string must start with a derivation from NT0 and NT4. Let's see if the string starts with tokens that could be part of NT0 or NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t77. Let me check what NT0 and NT4 produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, I see that NT0 has multiple productions. One of them is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Another is NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. Also, NT0 appears in other productions like NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc. Wait, but the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so both NT0 and NT4 must be expanded.\n\nSo, starting with S, the expansion would be NT0 followed by NT4. Let me see the possible sequences for NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 or NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT5. Let's assume it goes via NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (since t77 is the first token, which might be related to NT9 or NT7).\n\nWait, looking at the productions for NT9: NT9 appears in several productions, like NT9 \u2192 't43' or NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Hmm, if the string starts with t77, which is the start of NT7 or NT? Let me check the productions for NT9. Oh, wait, the grammar might have multiple ways to produce t9.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe another approach is to parse the string backward to see if each token can be generated by working from the end.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should try to find the leftmost derivation. Starting from S, which is NT0 NT4. So the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, each of NT0 and NT4 can be expanded further.\n\nSo, NT0 can be expanded in multiple ways, and NT4 can be expanded in multiple ways. Let's see what each can produce. Let's try to see which paths in the grammar produce the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since this might take a long time, maybe I can look for the tokens in the string and see which non-terminals they can come from.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt77 is the first token. From the grammar, which symbols produce t77?\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3: but t5 is 't5', so that's not it.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8: 't9' and 't8'. But I don't see 't6' directly here.\n\nWait, perhaps NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Then, NT9 \u2192 't43' or something else. Wait, 't77' is a token. Let me check where 't77' appears.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see several NTx entries. For instance, NT0 \u2192 't23' in some rules. Let me check if any NTx leads to 't77'.\n\nFrom NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8: that would produce 't9' and 't8' if they are terminals. But I don't see 't77' directly. Alternatively, NT8 has some productions, like NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0, etc., but I don't see 't77' from NT8.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 \u2192 NT13 (from somewhere? Wait, in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't13', but that's a terminal, so NT7 can produce 't13' directly. But the first token is 't77', which doesn't match any NTx's production that directly produce it as a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps 't77' is an NT production. Let me check the productions. Is there a rule where one of the NT symbols directly produces 't77'? I don't recall seeing NT77 in the grammar, or any production that generates 't77' as a terminal. Let me re-examine the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nBut not 't77'. So perhaps 't77' can only be produced by an NT symbol, but since that NT symbol isn't present in the grammar, it's impossible for 't77' to appear in the string. That would mean the string is invalid.\n\nWait, but is NT77 part of the grammar? Checking through all the grammar rules, I don't see any NT77 production. All NT symbols are up to NT8 or higher, but I don't see a rule that leads to 't77' as a terminal.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't77' in the string implies that there's a production NT77 \u2192 't77', which isn't present in the grammar. Since the grammar doesn't have that production, the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nThus, the answer is No, the string isn't generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-757","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to determine whether a particular string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is `t3 t23 t80 t62 t52 t21 t17 t67 t52 t27 t56 t77 t26 t79 t14 t40 t72 t64 t28 t43 t67 t77 t74 t32 t47 t64 t26 t57 t12 t61 t57 t31 t44 t70 t40 t62 t42 t62 t62 t72`.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand both the grammar and the string to figure out if the string can be produced by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the productions that directly go to terminals, which are atomic.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that it's a large set of productions. However, with a string of 41 tokens (each is a terminal like 't3'), it's impractical to track each step manually without a systematic approach. Since it's a parse tree, each step in the parsing would involve combining two symbols at a time, reducing the string from long to shorter until reaching the start symbol S.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and both sides are non-terminals except for the atomic productions to terminals. However, in this case, the grammar seems to have both B \u2192 BC and BC \u2192 B or BC \u2192 C, but looking more closely, the productions are all of the form A \u2192 B C, except some which go directly to terminals. So actually, it's a mix. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form strictly requires that each production is A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a (for terminals a). But in the given grammar, all productions except some have the form of non-terminals combining into other non-terminals, but in some cases, non-terminals are written like NT0 -> 't43', which are terminals.\n\nSo the grammar includes both types: some productions produce non-terminals (left-hand side is non-terminal, right-hand side is two non-terminals), and some produce terminals (right-hand side is a terminal). This is acceptable because CNF allows for both, although sometimes CNF is defined to only have non-terminals on the right side. Wait, no, actually, in standard CNF, the productions are A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. However, some versions allow terminals on the right, which would make it a modified Chomsky Normal Form.\n\nBut in this case, the grammar provided includes both. For example, S -> NT0 NT4, which is two non-terminals. But there are also productions like NT0 -> 't23', which is a terminal. So this grammar is in a form that's slightly non-standard, as it includes both non-terminals and terminals on the right-hand side. So, the grammar is a combination of productions that generate non-terminals and terminals, which is slightly different but still context-free.\n\nGiven that, the string in question is a concatenation of terminals. Each step in the parsing would involve replacing a pair of non-terminals with a symbol (which could be another non-terminal or a terminal), reducing the string's length by one each time until we reach S.\n\nBut with the given string being quite long (41 symbols), and the grammar being quite extensive, it's infeasible to check this manually. So I need to find another approach.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to reverse-engineer the possible parse tree. Since the string starts with 't3' and ends with 't72', I need to see if there's a production that can generate this sequence. Alternatively, I can look at the string as a sequence of tokens and see if it can be broken down according to the grammar rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string contains symbols that cannot be derived from any production in the grammar. Looking at the string, I see tokens like 't3', 't23', 't17', etc. However, the grammar's productions for the non-terminals seem to produce a mix of terminal and non-terminal combinations, but each production ultimately terminates with a terminal. So each non-terminal can eventually be replaced by a sequence of terminals.\n\nBut to know which terminals, perhaps I should look at the rules for each non-terminal and see what terminals they can produce. Let's try to analyze the non-terminals and their production paths to terminals.\n\nLooking at the first production S -> NT0 NT4. So the string starts with 't3', 't23', etc., perhaps we can see what each of these terminals comes from.\n\nBut this approach might take a long time. Instead, perhaps I should note that if any of these terminals cannot be derived by any non-terminal, then the string isn't possible. For example, if a non-terminal only produces 't43' and nothing else, then trying to parse a token from that non-terminal which doesn't match would fail.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can try to see if there's a way to produce each token 't3', 't23', etc., from some non-terminal.\n\nFor instance, let's look at 't3'. In the given grammar, there's a production NT3 -> 't72', 't53', etc. So perhaps NT3 can produce 't3', but looking through the productions, I don't see an explicit rule for NT3. Wait, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT3 -> 't72', 't53', 't44', 't70', 't24', 't27', 't51', 't53', 't31', 't47', 't10', 't24', 't54', 't31', 't39', 't69', etc. Wait, actually, in the given grammar, there are several rules where NT3 is replaced by various terminals. For example, NT3->'t72', 't53', 't47', etc. So 't3' is not present as a terminal in any of NT3's productions. So can any non-terminal derive 't3'?\n\nLooking through the other non-terminals, perhaps NT8 or NT5 can produce 't3'. Looking at NT8->'t5', 't32', 't84', 't9', etc. No 't3' here.\n\nLooking at NT0: NT0 can be 't23', 't9', 't74', etc. So 't3' may not be directly a terminal of NT0.\n\nWait, perhaps NT3 itself can produce 't3' in one of its rules. But looking again through the given grammar, I don't see NT3->'t3' anywhere. So if 't3' appears in the string, it must be derived from a non-terminal that can produce 't3'. But none of the non-terminals seem to directly produce 't3' as a terminal. Therefore, it's impossible for 't3' to be in the parse tree. So the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, let me cross-check. Did I miss any production where any non-terminal can produce 't3'? Scanning through all the grammar rules for non-terminals, I don't see a production that results in 't3'. So that means 't3' is not part of the language generated by this grammar, making the entire string invalid.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains the token 't3', which cannot be derived by any non-terminal in the given grammar. Therefore, the string is not in the language generated by the grammar.\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-761","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces: `t56 t83 t44 t17 t39 t3 t72 t23 t61 t54 t80 t12 t32 t27 t21 t60 t60 t44 t35 t81 t31 t53 t32 t40 t56 t20 t83 t33 t2 t54 t28 t53 t84 t52 t63 t35 t13 t79 t3 t80`. \n\nFirst, since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That means each step in the derivation produces two symbols at a time. To parse the string, I can work backwards from the start symbol S and see if I can break down the string into the productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string should ultimately be derived from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first and last tokens will be used to determine if they match NT0 and NT4. But in CNF, each step splits into two parts. However, since the string is a linear sequence, I'll need to split it into segments that correspond to the leftmost and rightmost expansions.\n\nLet me list the productions for clarity:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo, the string must start with NT0 and end with NT4. The tokens are a list, so I can try dividing the string into two parts: one from the start and one from the end.\n\nBut since the grammar uses non-terminals, I need to see if the entire string can be formed by expanding all non-terminals into terminals step by step. Each step will split a non-terminal into two others, which will themselves be split until only terminals are left.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to parse the string backward, starting from the end and seeing if it can be reduced to the start symbol. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser or a bottom-up approach might work.\n\nLet me try breaking down the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\nt56 t83 t44 t17 t39 t3 t72 t23 t61 t54 t80 t12 t32 t27 t21 t60 t60 t44 t35 t81 t31 t53 t32 t40 t56 t20 t83 t33 t2 t54 t28 t53 t84 t52 t63 t35 t13 t79 t3 t80\n\nFirst, the start symbol is S, which expands to NT0 NT4. So, the first non-terminal is NT0, and the last non-terminal should be NT4. Let's look at the first tokens and the last tokens.\n\nThe first tokens are t56, t83, t44, etc. The last part ends with ... t35 t80. Hmm, perhaps t80 is the terminal at the end, but according to the grammar, t80 is a terminal. So, to have NT4, the last part must derive to t43 or another terminal that corresponds to NT4.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, the only production for NT4 is:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\nWait, but in the given grammar, the productions for NT4 aren't listed in the initial part. Let me check the provided grammar:\n\nLooking back, the user provided a long list of productions, and I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT7 NT4\nNT4 \u2192 NT6 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n\nSo there are multiple productions for NT4.\n\nSimilarly, for NT0, there are several productions.\n\nSo, each non-terminal can split into two other non-terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, perhaps we can try to split the string into parts that correspond to these productions.\n\nBut since the string is quite long, maybe I can check for the presence of certain keywords that might indicate which non-terminals are involved.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t56, and in the grammar, one of the productions for NT4 is NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT3, which can lead to t60 t23 or similar. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are listed as 't' followed by numbers or letters.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the terminals are 't14', 't43', 't72', etc. So, the string is a sequence of terminals, each matching one of these.\n\nWait, the string is given as: t56 t83 t44 t17 t39 t3 t72 t23 t61 t54 t80 t12 t32 t27 t21 t60 t60 t44 t35 t81 t31 t53 t32 t40 t56 t20 t83 t33 t2 t54 t28 t53 t84 t52 t63 t35 t13 t79 t3 t80\n\nSo, each token in the string is a terminal, and the question is whether these terminals can be generated by the grammar.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production splits a non-terminal into two symbols, each of which is either a non-terminal or a terminal. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production only has two symbols on the right-hand side.\n\nTo determine if the string can be generated, we can simulate the derivation from the start symbol, trying to split the string into the required parts.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to use the CYK algorithm for parsing, but since the grammar is given with specific productions, it's a bit more involved, but we can try.\n\nLet me attempt to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt56 t83 t44 t17 t39 t3 t72 t23 t61 t54 t80 t12 t32 t27 t21 t60 t60 t44 t35 t81 t31 t53 t32 t40 t56 t20 t83 t33 t2 t54 t28 t53 t84 t52 t63 t35 t13 t79 t3 t80\n\nFirst, the entire string needs to be generated by the start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the first NT0 must generate the first part, and the second NT4 must generate the second part.\n\nLet's consider NT4. Looking at the productions for NT4, one of them is NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT3. Let's see if that can lead to part of the string.\n\nAlso, another production for NT4 is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nBut looking at the terminals, let's see:\n\nThe first token is t56. Looking at the grammar, t56 occurs in the production NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, one of the productions is NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7. Wait, let me check the grammar:\n\nYes, I see NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7 in the productions.\n\nSo, NT4 can produce NT3 and NT7.\n\nSimilarly, looking at t56, does any production involve t56 as a terminal? Let's look at the grammar terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, t56 is produced by NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9. Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar, one production is NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2, but that's for NT7.\n\nWait, looking for where a non-terminal produces t56: in the grammar, for NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, which might produce t79 or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe t56 is an intermediate symbol.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's consider each terminal and see which productions can generate them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each terminal is on the right-hand side of a production. For example, 't56' is produced by NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9. So, NT6 can produce 't79', assuming that NT7 \u2192 't79'.\n\nWait, looking back, I see in the grammar:\n\nNT7 \u2192 't54', among others.\n\nWait, no, let me check the grammar rules:\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT0, there's a rule NT0 \u2192 't23'. Similarly, other non-terminals produce specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps t56 is produced by NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, and NT7 \u2192 't54',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. That makes parsing easier because I don't have to worry about more than two symbols, which simplifies the process.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is `t83 t7 t20 t52 t73 t12 t12 t51 t17 t67 t5 t64 t47 t57 t21 t56 t54 t60 t21 t44 t7 t62 t56 t5 t51 t15 t23 t42 t47 t13 t31 t10 t15 t27 t60 t53 t42 t2 t14 t28 t44`. \n\nI notice that the string is a sequence of tokens like 't83', 't7', etc. I should check which of these tokens are terminals and which are non-terminals. Wait, most of these look like terminals since they start with 't' followed by numbers, but I need to check the grammar's production rules to see which are terminals and which are non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some rules end with 't...' like NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't47', etc. So those are terminals. The rest are non-terminals.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that: The grammar's right-hand sides have combinations of NTs and 't's. So 't's are terminals, and NTs are non-terminals. So when I parse the string, I need to see if each part can be reduced according to the grammar.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, I can use either the top-down (LL) parsing approach or the bottom-up parsing. Maybe a better approach is to construct the parse tree step by step, starting from the start symbol S and seeing if I can derive the string.\n\nThe start symbol is S. The first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So the first step is to split the string into two parts: the leftmost NT0 and the right NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first parts are 't83 t7 t20 ...'. So I need to see if the first token is somehow connected to NT0 or NT4.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should instead analyze the structure of the grammar and see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can notice if the string can be broken down into the right sequence of non-terminals that can expand to the given tokens.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the grammar is in CNF, the length of the string must correspond to a certain number of steps. For a string of length n, it should require (n-1) production steps because each production adds one symbol. But looking at the string, it's a long string with 39 tokens. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the string is split into tokens, each being a separate element. So each token is a terminal symbol like 't83'.\n\nWait, but wait, the initial productions in the grammar produce two non-terminals. Each non-terminal might then produce two others, and so on. So the generated string is a sequence of terminals, each of which must appear as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo first, let me list all the terminal symbols from the grammar. They include things like 't83', 't7', 't20', etc. Maybe I should extract all the terminal symbols from the grammar to see if the string only contains those.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the production rules end with either another non-terminal (like NT3 -> NT5 NT9) or a terminal (like NT3 -> 't72'). So any terminal symbol in the grammar is a right-hand side that's a single terminal. Let me list all terminals:\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT7 -> 't54'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't8'\nNT3 -> 't51'\nNT8 -> 't84'\nNT8 -> 't81'\nNT0 -> 't62'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT4 -> 't27'\nNT0 -> 't67'\nNT2 -> 't26'\nNT3 -> 't24'\nNT9 -> 't44'\nNT5 -> 't15'\nNT7 -> 't33'\nNT8 -> 't64'\nNT6 -> 't77'\nNT6 -> 't43'\nNT8 -> 't56'\nNT3 -> 't2'\nNT8 -> 't73'\nNT7 -> 't76'\nNT6 -> 't61'\nNT2 -> 't53'\nNT3 -> 't69'\nNT4 -> 't70'\nNT0 -> 't12'\nNT9 -> 't20'\nNT7 -> 't57'\nNT7 -> 't7'\nNT8 -> 't57'\nNT2 -> 't63'\nNT9 -> 't79'\nNT8 -> 't53'\nNT8 -> 't22'\nNT6 -> 't8'\nNT0 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't51'\nNT4 -> 't13'\nNT5 -> 't62'\nNT3 -> 't8'\nNT7 -> 't17'\nNT4 -> 't28'\nNT0 -> 't40'\nNT3 -> 't39'\nNT3 -> 't10'\nNT0 -> 't52'\nNT7 -> 't70'\nNT6 -> 't11'\nNT0 -> 't35'\nNT6 -> 't67'\nNT8 -> 't77'\nNT4 -> 't42'\nNT7 -> 't31'\nNT10? Wait, no. All production rules have non-terminals on both sides. So each terminal is on the right-hand side.\n\nWait, no. The terminal symbols are those that appear on the right-hand side without being part of a production. So in the grammar, whenever a production ends with a terminal, that's a terminal symbol.\n\nSo from the above, the terminals are:\n\nt72, t47, t13, t23, t33, t37, t54, t5, t53, t8, t51, t84, t81, t62, t7, t27, t67, t26, t24, t44, t15, t73, t33, t64, t77, t43, t56, t2, t73, t76, t61, t53, t69, t70, t12, t20, t57, t8, t57, t63, t79, t53, t22, t8, t80, t51, t13, t62, t8, t70, t11, t35, t67, t77, t42, t31 (possibly? Not sure if I'm capturing all).\n\nWait, but some of these may be duplicated or from other productions. So the string is made up of 39 tokens, all of which are a combination of these terminal symbols.\n\nBut I need to see if the string can be derived by the grammar. So perhaps it's better to try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe first step is S -> NT0 NT4. So I need to split the string into NT0 and NT4 expansions.\n\nLet me look at the first few tokens: 't83 t7 t20 ...'. Wait, that's a problem because S starts with NT0 and NT4, which are non-terminals. So the first token should come from the expansion of NT0, and the rest would come from NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me clarify: The initial production is S -> NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be the concatenation of what NT0 can generate and what NT4 can generate.\n\nSo, for example, the first token in the string must be the first symbol generated by NT0, the second symbol by NT0's next expansion, or alternatively, if NT0 can produce a longer string, but in CNF, each production is exactly two non-terminals, so each step adds one token.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider that each step of the grammar applies one production, so each time a non-terminal is replaced by two non-terminals, which in turn may be replaced until terminals are reached.\n\nSo perhaps the string is built from left to right, starting with S, then replacing S"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-772","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a particular context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, the grammar is a bit complex, with many non-terminals and production rules. The string to evaluate is `t43 t74 t44 t43 t40 t54 t27 t64 t17 t39 t9 t23 t15 t9 t22 t37 t28 t15 t57 t54 t81 t14 t53 t54 t63 t39 t52 t39 t52 t26 t27 t60 t11 t2 t9 t57 t57 t21 t23 t63 t84`.\n\nWait, first, Chomsky Normal Form means all production rules are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is usually S, so in this case, S is the top symbol. The string starts with t43, which is a terminal, so the first step is to look for a production rule that starts with S and directly produces t43 or sequences that can lead to it.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the S production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string must start with the symbols derived from NT0 and NT4. Let me see the productions for NT0 and NT4.\n\nNT0 has several rules. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, but also NT0 \u2192 't23'. Similarly, NT4 has rules like NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT4, NT4 \u2192 't37', among others. The first token is 't43', which isn't directly in the initial productions of S, so perhaps I need to trace back from 't43' to see if it can be derived from some rules in the grammar.\n\nWait, the grammar has non-terminals that produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't43', NT7 \u2192 't13', NT5 \u2192 't27', etc. So 't43' is directly produced by NT9. So the string starts with 't43', which would mean that the first application of a production rule must derive NT9 \u2192 't43'.\n\nSo, in the initial step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, NT0 should derive something that starts with a production that can lead to 't43' as the first symbol. Looking at NT0's rules, one is NT0 \u2192 't23', another is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. Since 't23' is a terminal, but the string starts with 't43', which is derived from NT9, I think the S production must lead to a string that starts with NT9. So perhaps S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT4 \u2192 something.\n\nWait, no, because NT4 can produce t37, t5, etc. Let me check whether 't43' can be part of the string starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is being constructed as a sequence of NT0, NT4, etc., but with certain rules leading to t's. Let me see.\n\nWait, the first token is 't43', which is derived from NT9 \u2192 't43'. So, the first step would be that S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and NT0 and NT4 must derive something that starts with t43, but that doesn't seem right because S is NT0 followed by NT4, so their first symbols would be the first symbols of their respective derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is part of a larger chain leading to 't43' as the first symbol. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, perhaps NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and NT7 \u2192 't13', and NT4 \u2192 something that starts with 't...'.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused.

{"custom_id":"request-778","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of t-terms like t9 t26 t42 and so on. First, I should recall that Chomsky normal form means each production rule has two non-terminals on the left and two terminals or non-terminals on the right. So the grammar provided has all such rules.\n\nI need to determine if the string can be derived from the start symbol S. The start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S directly produces NT0 NT4. So the first step is to see if the string starts with the right sequence of terms that can be generated from S.\n\nLooking at the string: the first few terms are t9, t26, etc. From S, we get NT0 and NT4. So I should check if the string can be broken down starting with t9 followed by t26, which are the terminals for NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the grammar's rules for NT0 and NT4 must produce these terms. So NT0 -> 't23' according to the provided rules, and NT4 has multiple productions, including NT4 -> 't37' and others that might generate longer sequences. But the string starts with t9, which might be a terminal from another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT5 can produce t47, and other non-terminals might produce t9, but I need to check recursively. Alternatively, perhaps the string starts with t9, which could be from a non-terminal that eventually derives to it.\n\nWait, no. Let me look at the rules for NT0. From the grammar, NT0 has several productions, one of which is NT0 -> 't23' and another is NT0 -> NT5 NT5. So if the string starts with t9, perhaps the derivation goes through another path.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the key is that each non-terminal must be able to produce the sequence of terms in the string. So starting from S, S produces NT0 NT4. So t9 could be from NT0, but looking at the grammar, NT0's productions include 't23', but t9 is another terminal which may come from a different non-terminal. Alternatively, perhaps the NT0 can derive a sequence that includes t9 somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Each production step in the grammar either combines non-terminals or produces terminals. So I can model this as a tree, where each non-terminal can expand into terminals or other non-terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals, so every symbol in it must eventually come from a production that directly or indirectly becomes a terminal. So for each symbol in the string, I need to see if it's in the set of terminals produced by any non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each non-terminal seems to have productions that eventually produce various terminals like 't9', 't26', etc. So each of the t_X terms in the string is reachable via some production path. Therefore, individually, each symbol in the string is a terminal that can be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut that's just the first step. The second thing I need to check is the structure of the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is binary, so each step in the derivation increases the number of symbols by one or more, but in this case, each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal on the right side.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So each step in the derivation can only produce a single terminal if the production is A->a, or two non-terminals if A->BC. Therefore, the derived string must consist of a sequence of terminals, with non-terminals only on the left side during the process.\n\nBut the given string consists of a list of terminals in order, without any non-terminals. So it must have been derived step by step through a series of productions that eventually break down the non-terminals into terminals.\n\nThe problem is that with such a long string, it's impossible to simulate the entire derivation. Instead, perhaps I can check if each term in the string can be generated by some non-terminal, and if their sequence can be linked via the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a parsing problem, where I try to parse the string using the grammar to see if it can be fully derived. Since the problem is manual, I'll attempt a simplified version.\n\nLooking at the string: t9 t26 t42 t33 t21 t24 t79 t33 t40 t20 t74 t79 t76 t69 t24 t20 t84 t35 t2 t57 t35 t23 t37 t64 t51 t7 t13 t63 t54 t7 t39 t13 t61 t24 t72 t12 t23 t20 t64 t83 t11 t20.\n\nFirst, S -> NT0 NT4. So the first symbols should correspond to NT0 followed by NT4, but in reality, NT0 and NT4 are each non-terminals, so they can further expand.\n\nSo the first step is to check if the string can be split into parts that match the possible sequences from NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut given the length, maybe it's better to look for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to look for how the terminals are chained together via the grammar. Each terminal in the string must be reachable from the root by following the productions.\n\nBut to check whether the string can be produced, it must have a leftmost derivation that matches it.\n\nWait, perhaps an easier approach is to see if each symbol in the string is in the set of terminals that any non-terminal can produce. If all symbols are terminals, and the grammar can produce that sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to see if all the symbols are present in the grammar. Looking through the rules, for example, NT0 has a production to 't23', NT5 has 't47', etc. So the string has symbols like t9, t26, which would need to be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar's rules, I notice that each non-terminal is defined in terms of other non-terminals or terminals. For example, NT0's rules include 't23', and also other combinations. So, each of the t_X terms in the string must be the result of a production from some non-terminal.\n\nBut wait, the challenge is not just that each symbol is a terminal that can be produced, but that the entire sequence is a sentential form derived from S through successive productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider that each terminal in the string must be connected via the grammar's productions. But without a full parser, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to write out the derivation steps for a smaller part to see if a pattern emerges. Starting with S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThen, NT0 and NT4 each expand. Let's see:\n\nFrom ND0: the rules include NT0 -> NT6 NT7 and NT7 -> NT4 NT0. This seems cyclic, so perhaps generating a longer sequence.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can look for a pattern that the string must follow. For example, seeing if each t is generated by a certain number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a certain structure, like alternations of non-terminals expanding into terminals, which might correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the grammar is structured in such a way that each non-terminal corresponds to certain t-values. For example, NT0 might produce terms like t23, t24, t57, etc.\n\nBut honestly, I'm getting stuck because I don't have a concrete way to check each step manually. Given the time constraints, maybe I can make an educated guess based on the possible productions. Since each non-terminal eventually can produce a terminal and the string is a sequence of terminals, I would say it's possible, but I'm not entirely certain.\n\nWait, but actually, considering the complexity of the grammar and the length of the string, it's more plausible that the string is invalid because it's too long and may not follow the specific recursive pattern defined by the grammar's rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all the terms in the string are reachable via some productions from the grammar, so the answer is 'Yes'.\n\nBut honestly, without a step-by-step derivation, I can't be sure.

{"custom_id":"request-782","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which probably makes things a bit easier because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. \n\nFirst, let's look at the string: `t13 t42 t56 t14 t57 t51 t15 t27 t40 t13 t76 t64 t37 t67 t60 t42 t10 t81 t54 t12 t77 t27 t17 t21 t69 t56 t42 t2 t53 t79 t24 t3 t69 t72 t3 t84 t69 t64 t83 t11 t77 t37`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of 38 tokens separated by spaces. Each token is a string of the form 't' followed by two digits. I need to trace these tokens back through the grammar to see if they can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So each step starts by breaking into two parts: one with NT0 and one with NT4. Let's split the string into these two parts.\n\nLooking at S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the first token should be in NT0's language, and the second in NT4's language. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) each consist of two symbols. So each production is at two levels, meaning each string can be thought of as sequences of productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should parse the entire string as if it's a sequence of tokens that result from applying the productions step by step. Since each production in CNF splits into two, the parse tree would have a binary expansion.\n\nEach token in the string must be a terminal (since the non-terminals are in NT and the string uses 't' followed by numbers, which are terminals). So I need to check if each token can be derived by starting from S and expanding.\n\nWait, but the grammar also has non-terminals that produce other non-terminals. So I might need to see each NT (like NT0, NT4, etc.) and see if they can derive any of these 't*' tokens.\n\nLet me list out some NT productions to see if 't*' is in their languages.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT0 seems to lead to combinations that ultimately produce various 't' tokens. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 and NT0 can split into others.\n\n- Similarly, NT4 can lead to 't's through various paths.\n\nI might not need to map every possible derivation, but perhaps check if each token arises from either the start symbol or through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be processed by checking if each 't' token is a direct production.\n\nWait, but how? Each rule is like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, which then each of those can split further, etc. So each non-terminal can have a path that leads to a terminal. But to do this, I need to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar.\n\nAnother idea: Perhaps construct a parse tree for the string. Starting with the root S, each node is a non-terminal, and each leaf is a terminal 't*'. So I need to see if the string can be split into two parts that each can be generated by NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the string must be some output of NT0 followed by NT4's output. So the string can be divided into two parts where the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nSimilarly, each NTo and NT4 can themselves be expanded. So I can recursively check each part.\n\nBut the string is 38 tokens. Each NT production in CNF can expand into a sequence of two non-terminals, which in turn expand, until we get to terminals. So each token must correspond to a terminal in the grammar.\n\nFirst, let's list all the non-terminals in the grammar:\n\nNT0, NT7, NT5, NT6, NT4, NT8, NT3, NT9, NT2, NT.\n\nWait, many Nts like NT5, NT6, etc.\n\nBut perhaps more importantly, let's consider the tokens in the string. Each token is of the form tXY. Let's see if any of these match a production. For example, 't13' occurs several times, as does 't42', etc.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that a lot of terminals are generated by the non-terminals. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72' and others.\n\nWait, for example: NT7 \u2192 't13' (in some rules), and NT4 \u2192 't13'. Wait, looking at the grammar, some Nts have 't's as their productions, e.g., NT7 \u2192 NT13.\n\nBut no, all the rules listed start with 'NT' and then an arrow, so perhaps the user made a typo and the NT rules have 't' producing as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules, for example: `NT6 -> NT11`. Then later, 'NT11 -> 't57''.\n\nWait, no. The grammar shows `NT11` appears, and some of its productions. Wait, let me look through all the rules to find 't*' as the RHS of any non-terminal.\n\nLooking through all rules, I don't immediately see any non-terminals that produce a 't*' as a single terminal. All the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user provided a sequence of grammar rules, each with NT and terminal t's. Let me look for any non-terminal that directly maps to a 't*'.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\n- `NT8 -> NT5 NT3`\n- `NT5 -> NT9 NT6`\n- ...\n\nHmm, I don't see any direct production where NT \u2192 't13' for example. But I do see rules like `NT0 -> 't23'`, `NT3 -> 't72'`, and so on. Each NT eventually leads down to a terminal, but perhaps the string contains terminals that can be produced by some NTs.\n\nSo each token in the string must be a terminal that can be produced by at least one of the NTs in the grammar.\n\nLet me go through each token in the string and see if it's in the terminals of some NT production.\n\nThe tokens are: t13, t42, t56, t14, t57, t51, t15, t27, t40, t13, t76, t64, t37, t67, t60, t42, t10, t81, t54, t12, t77, t27, t17, t21, t69, t56, t42, t2, t53, t79, t24, t3, t69, t72, t3, t84, t69, t64, t83, t11, t77, t37.\n\nSo 38 tokens. Each of these must be a terminal in the grammar. So I need to check if each token can be produced by some NT.\n\nLooking for the list of 't*' terminals in the grammar:\n\nFrom the rules, for example, `NT0 -> 't23'`, `NT3 -> 't72'`, `NT6-> 't83'`, etc.\n\nBut the tokens given are a lot, so I need to see if all these tokens can be obtained as products of some NT.\n\nWait, let's see for example:\n\nDoes NT6 produce t72? Let me look for that. Looking through the grammar, I don't see NT6 \u2192 't72', but perhaps through a chain.\n\nWait, all tokens must be either in the immediate terminals of the grammar or reachable through the derivations.\n\nAlternatively, for each token, check if there is a path in the grammar that leads to it.\n\nBut this could take a while. Let me try to see if I can match these tokens with any NT.\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT8 NT6 \u2192 Not directly, but maybe through some steps. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, all token look like 'tXY' where X and Y are digits. The question is whether each 'tXY' is present as a terminal in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, let's compile all 't*' terminals:\n\nFrom the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23'\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72', 't76', 't37', 't70', 't74', 't39', 't69', 't53', 't3', 't84', etc.\n\nNT7 \u2192 't13', 't67', 't77', 't43' (from `NT7 -> NT46 NT7` etc.)\n\nWait, I think I need"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe string consists of a series of `t` tokens followed by numbers. Each `t` is followed by a number, like `t12 t77...`, which probably corresponds to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. My task is to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step using the grammar. Let's break down the string:\n\nt12 t77 t26 t40 t24 t27 t53 t8 t63 t24 t56 t47 t47 t3 t32 t62 t79 t24 t60 t37 t62 t21 t9 t15 t13 t72 t73 t73 t20 t57 t9 t22 t32 t54 t63 t84 t5 t13 t32 t84 t10 t83 t80\n\nI think each `tX` corresponds to a production where the non-terminal on the left expands into `tX`. So the idea is to see if these `tX` steps form a valid derivation path in the grammar.\n\nI'll try to think of it as trying to expand S and see if each `tX` in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nBut this might be complex. Alternatively, perhaps each `tX` corresponds to a specific non-terminal that produces `tX`. So I can map each `tX` to the corresponding non-terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example, `S -> NT0 NT4`. So S expands to NT0 and NT4. Then each of those non-terminals expand further, etc.\n\nBut how does `t12` come into play? Maybe each `tX` is the result of a production where NTx produces `tX`. For instance, in the grammar, I see rules like `NT0 -> 't23'`, which is a terminal. So `t23` is a terminal that comes from NT0.\n\nSo perhaps each `tX` in the string is generated by a specific non-terminal NTx. So `t12` must be produced by NT12, but wait, in the given grammar, I don't see any rule like NT12 \u2192 tX. Let me check the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any symbols like NT12, NT26, etc., except for some `tX` terminals. The production rules involve various non-terminals, and the terminals are things like 't12', 't77', etc.\n\nWait a second, in the grammar, the non-terminals seem to have productions that lead to sequences of terminals. For instance, NT3 \u2192 t72. So maybe each non-terminal NTx is defined to produce a specific terminal.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the string is the result of expanding NTx nodes into their respective terminals, so each `tX` in the string must correspond to a rule where NTx \u2192 tX.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see explicit rules for all NTx terminals. Most of the rules are for non-terminals combining other non-terminals, but some have terminals, like NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, which doesn't produce a terminal yet.\n\nWait, perhaps this grammar is such that some non-terminals directly produce a single terminal, while others produce other non-terminals. So for example, some NTx might be defined as NTx \u2192 a single terminal like tY.\n\nIf that's the case, then when expanding, each time you see a `tY`, it must come from a production that has NTx \u2192 tY.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I'm noticing that several non-terminals have productions that are of the form NTx \u2192 'tY'. For example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'\nNT5 \u2192 't47'\nNT7 \u2192 't54'\nNT0 \u2192 't23'\nNT4 \u2192 't32'\nNT9 \u2192 't44'\nNT6 \u2192 't11'\netc.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals, when used in expansion, would produce a single terminal `tY`. So, perhaps the string is built by expanding S and other non-terminals in such a way that at some point, certain non-terminals produce tX.\n\nNow, to see if the given string can be generated, I need to see if its tokens are consistent with what the grammar allows. Let's try to see how the string is built step by step.\n\nThe string starts with `t12`. So, that would imply that at some point in the derivation, a non-terminal that produces `t12` is used.\n\nBut looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTx that produces 't12'. Hmm, that seems problematic. Maybe I misread.\n\nWait, let me look again. The grammar rules:\n\nLooking through each rule, except for the ones that produce terminals like 'tX', the non-terminals seem to produce other non-terminals. So perhaps each `tX` must come directly from a rule where NTx \u2192 'tX', but if I don't have such a rule, then that `tX` can't be generated.\n\nBut in the given grammar, I see rules like NT2 \u2192 't7', and others. So 't7' comes from NT2, for example.\n\nLooking back, does the given string have `t12` in it? Yes, the first token is `t12`, which would have to come from a rule where NT12 \u2192 't12'. But in the grammar, I don't see any rule that defines NT12 as a terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps 't12' comes from a longer production that eventually reduces to 't12'. But in CNF, each step only allows two non-terminals, and terminals are only on the right side as single symbols. So in the initial steps, non-terminals must expand into two non-terminals, and so on, until the non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut in the given grammar, some non-terminals have multiple productions; perhaps some of them produce a sequence of terminals. For example, if a non-terminal's production involves another production that eventually becomes a terminal.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, most of the non-terminals are defined via other non-terminals, and only certain ones have direct terminal productions.\n\nFor instance, looking at the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nBut then NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\nAnd NT7 \u2192 NT13\nWait, but NT13 is another non-terminal, which has NT13 \u2192 't54'.\n\nWait, let me try to see:\n\nSuppose we have NT7 \u2192 't13' according to the rules.\n\nSo NT7 can be replaced by 't13'.\n\nSimilarly, NT6 can be processed as NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8.\n\nIf NT9 \u2192 't53', then NT6 can expand into NT9 NT8. Then, NT8 can expand further.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0 (among others), but it also has NT8 \u2192 't5' directly.\n\nWait, so NT8 has two options: either combine with NT6 and NT0, or produce 't5'.\n\nSo perhaps 't5' comes from NT8 \u2192 't5'.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 can produce 't23'.\n\nSo let's see. The first token is `t12`, which must come from some NTx that has a production NTx \u2192 't12'. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule for NT12. So that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't12' is generated from a non-terminal that, through some steps, reduces to 't12'. But without such a rule, that seems impossible.\n\nWait, is there a rule that leads to `t12`? Looking through the grammar, I don't see any NTx \u2192 't12'. So that implies that `t12` cannot be produced by the grammar. But the string provided starts with `t12`, so that would mean the string isn't possible to generate by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me scan the entire grammar again for any NTx that produces 't12'. Hmm.

{"custom_id":"request-794","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar and the string are provided, but the string is quite long, so I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that CNF grammars have production rules where each right-hand side (RHS) is exactly two non-terminals except for the start symbol which can also produce a terminal. That might help in parsing the string since each production step reduces the count of symbols by one.\n\nThe grammar consists of several non-terminals: S, NT0, NT7, NT5, NT6, NT4, NT2, NT3, NT8, NT9. Some of these seem to correspond to terminals, like 't83', 't69', etc., based on the production rules.\n\nLooking at the string to evaluate, it's a sequence of terminals: t83, t69, t77, t81, t51, t10, t73, t80, t9, t13, t64, t11, t43, t2, t53, t13, t20, t40, t33, t24, t83, t7, t24, t52, t17, t69, t23, t37, t47, t54, t62, t52, t69, t43, t47, t62, t53, t24, t42, t8, t28, t40, t39.\n\nI think the approach here might be to try and parse the string using the grammar, checking if each step corresponds to a valid production rule.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, the derivation tree should have a certain structure. Also, the string should have a length that's a power of 2 or something similar because each step in CNF usually involves two symbols leading to one, so the number of symbols should halve each time. But the string given has 40 symbols. Wait, 40 isn't a power of two, which might indicate something's off, but maybe it's because the grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT4, which would produce two symbols initially. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the maximum possible derivation length, but that might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to find a parse tree for the string, starting from the start symbol S. Each step should expand into two non-terminals, until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet's try to see if the string starts with t83. Looking for the start symbol S, which expands to NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the productions, S -> NT0 NT4. So in the string, after S, we have NT0 and NT4. So the first two symbols in the string should correspond toNT0 and NT4. Wait, the first symbol is t83, but in the grammar, NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals. So the initial part of the string might be part of NT0 or NT4's expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at which non-terminals produce t83. Looking through the grammar, let's see which rules produce t83.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 -> NT0 NT2 (not t83). Wait, but wait in the grammar, some NT non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT6 -> t83 is one of the productions. Let me check the production rules:\n\nYes, looking through the list, I see NT6 -> t83. Similarly, NT0 -> t23, etc.\n\nSo to produce t83, the non-terminal must be NT6. So the string starts with 't83', so in the parse tree, the first step should involve a production of NT6 -> t83. But in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so NT6 itself must be in a production that's made up of two non-terminals.\n\nLooking for productions where NT6 is on the LHS: NT6 -> NT7 NT9, NT6 -> NT9 NT7, NT6 -> NT8 NT0, etc. Wait, no, looking through the grammar list, it says:\n\nNT6:\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2,\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0,\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9,\nNT6 -> NT8 NT0,\nNT6 -> NT7 NT0,\nNT6 -> NT8 NT7,\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, I need to find where NT6 is the LHS.\n\nLooking through each rule, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT8 NT0\nNT6 -> NT7 NT0\nNT6 -> NT8 NT7\nHT: Looking at the full list, I see:\n\nFrom the last part of the grammar:\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT9 NT7\nNT6 -> NT8 NT0\nNT6 -> NT7 NT0\nNT6 -> NT8 NT7\n\nHm, I don't see any production where NT6 directly produces a terminal like t83. Wait, but according to the rules, some NTs produce terminals. For example, NT2 can produce t7, t53, etc. Wait, actually, some non-terminals expand into terminals:\n\nFor example, NT6 -> t83 is in the list (I think I might have missed it earlier). Let me scan through all the rules:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't43'\n... etc.\n\nYes, looking through all the rules, I see that NT6 has: NT6 -> t83 is perhaps present.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nLooking at each rule, the right-hand sides:\n\nNT6: \nLooking through the list:\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT8 NT7\n\nWait, no NT6 is on the LHS, these all go to two non-terminals. But I don't see any production where NT6 directly produces a terminal. Hmm, that's confusing because t83 is a terminal, and in CNF, the only way a terminal appears is as the end of a derivation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nLooking through NT6's rules, I think I don't see any where NT6 produces a terminal directly. Wait, but wait, is there a production like NT6 -> t83? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar's RHS:\n\nNT6:\n- NT7 NT9\n- NT9 NT7\n- NT8 NT0\n- NT7 NT0\n- NT8 NT7\n\nNo, none of these end with a terminal, so NT6 can't produce t83 directly. Wait, but if t83 is a terminal, how does that happen in a CNF grammar? Because in CNF, terminals only appear at the end, so for a non-terminal to produce a terminal, it must have a production that eventually leads to that terminal in a single step. So perhaps there's a production path that leads NT6 to produce t83 through other non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me see if any NTs lead to t83 as a terminal.\n\nLooking for t83 in the RHS of any rules, including non-terminals:\n\nYes, in the end:\n\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't43'\nNT7 -> 't33'\nAnd then others like:\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nWait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me check each rule to see if any production ends in a terminal. Wait, no, the productions are all from non-terminals to other non-terminals except where the RHS is a single terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, the RHS must be two non-terminals. So any terminal in the RHS would violate CNF. Therefore, the only way a terminal can appear in the string is as the result of a production that terminates. So, for example, if NT6 has a production like NT6 -> a NT7, and NT7 -> b t83, then in that case, NT6 can produce a string ending with t83 via NT6 -> a NT7 -> a b t83.\n\nWait, but in this grammar, none of the productions for NTs directly produce a terminal. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier and need to find if any non-terminal can produce a terminal t83.\n\nWait, no, looking back at the grammar's rules, NT0 has a production NT0 -> 't23', but no NTs directly produce t83. Hmm, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I've misread the rules.\n\nWait, looking at the end"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-800","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is `t56 t14 t52 t32 t51 t52 t57 t73 t8 t15 t76 t80 t60 t42 t44 t72 t54 t80 t44 t47 t70 t80 t10 t13 t12 t20 t7 t12 t24 t84 t53 t80 t12 t35 t26 t23 t74 t5 t33 t63 t63 t54 t44 t56`. \n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grammar. It's given in Chomsky Normal Form, where each rule produces two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, which transforms into NT0 NT4. Each of these NT symbols eventually resolves into terminal strings, which are 't...' sequences or specific identifiers.\n\nThe string is a sequence of these t-strings. Since it's a context-free grammar, each production rule must be applied step by step to derive the entire string. However, with the length of the string and the number of possible non-terminals, this seems complex.\n\nI think the best approach is to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules. Let's see:\n\n1. The string starts with t56. Looking at the grammar, t56 is derived from NT6 -> NT7 NT9. So, each occurrence of t56 must come from NT6 resolving NT7 and NT9. \n\n2. Next, we have t14, which is directly a terminal. Looking at the grammar, NT2 -> 't14' and also other nt's can produce t14? Wait, from the rules, NT2 has several productions, but only one of them is NT2 -> 't14'. Wait, no, looking back, the grammar has lines like NT2 -> 't14', yes. So t14 is directly from NT2.\n\n3. The third token is t52. Let's see, NT52? Or wait, NT52 is not a non-terminal, the terminals are like t14, t15, etc. So t52 must come from some NT production. Looking through the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't52', among others. For example, NT8 can produce 't5' but also 't52' via NT8 -> 't52'? Wait, checking the grammar rules: Yes, looking at the grammar, there are multiple rules that produce various t's from NT's. So to get 't52', we might have a rule like NT52 (but wait, NTs are identifiers like NT0, NT1, etc., not numbers. So t52 is a terminal string from some NT production. Looking through the rules, I spot that NT8 -> 't52' is present. So the third token comes from NT8 -> t52.\n\nWait, no, looking back, in the grammar, there's a line \"NT8 -> t52\". Or wait, let me check: NT8 -> t52? No, in the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking through the grammar lines:\n\n- NT0 -> various productions including 't23', 't43', etc.\n\n- NT2 -> 't14', also some others.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, for example, NT0 -> 't23', NT0 -> 't43', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to go step by step through the grammar rules to see how each 't...' is generated.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, but that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, since the problem is to determine if the string is in the language, we can try to construct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is too long and complex, so perhaps the answer is \"No\". But I need to be sure.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the string contains t56 multiple times. Since t56 is generated by NT6 -> NT7 NT9, we can see if the string structure allows for this.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to look for any immediate contradictions.\n\nFor example, t56 appears at the beginning. So S must expand into NT0 NT4, and then each NT must resolve to produce t56.\n\nWait, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the left side is NT0 and the right side is NT4. So the expansion is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and then each NT0 and NT4 must produce sequences that form the beginning of the string.\n\nThe entire string starts with t56 t14. So perhaps NT0 produces 't56'... or wait, NT0 is a non-terminal, so it's not a terminal. Wait, wait, wait\u2014the initial string is sequences of t-strings. But in the grammar, the left-hand sides are NT symbols, and the right-hand sides are combinations of NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, in the grammar, each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A is an NT, and B and C can be NTs or terminals. So the entire string is built by expanding NTs into sequences of NTs and terminals.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals only. So for the string to be generated, each expansion must result in only terminals at the end.\n\nTherefore, the entire string must be the result of expanding the initial S to a string of terminals.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of t's, each possibly from NT productions. So each t in the string must be the result of a non-terminal expanding into a single terminal.\n\nBut some NTs can only produce terminals by a single rule. For example, NT2 \u2192 't14', so if a NT2 appears in the parse tree, it will produce 't14'.\n\nSo to parse the string, each t must come from some NT whose production includes that t.\n\nWait, but the problem is that it's difficult to check each t. Maybe the string is longer than any possible derivation, but it's likely that the answer is \"Yes\" because given the grammar's structure, it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 leads to NT0 and NT4 producing certain sequences.\n\nLet me see: NT0 can generate various things, including 't52' via NT0 \u2192 NT52? Wait, no, NT0's productions are from NT0 to NT6 NT7, among others, except in some cases.\n\nWait, no. Looking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT0 has several productions, but none directly produce 't52'. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and NT8 \u2192 't52'. So perhaps the way is for NT0 to produce NT6 and NT7, which then resolve to 't52' and something else? Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about each 't' in the string and see which NTs can produce them.\n\nFor example, the first token is t56. Looking for NTs that have a rule ending with 't56'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9: But no terminal there.\nWait, no, looking at all the grammar rules, it's clear that NT6 can't produce 't56' directly. Wait, looking through the rules, the only place 't56' appears is in the production NT8 \u2192 't56'? Wait, no, looking in the grammar lines provided, I see:\n\nYes, for example, in the grammar rules, there's \"NT8 -> t56\". So NT8 can produce 't56' directly. Similarly, NT9 can produce 't44' and 't63' among others.\n\nSo for the first token t56, perhaps it's produced by NT8, since NT8 has a production that ends with 't56'.\n\nWait, but how does the parsing work? Let's think:\n\nThe first part is t56 t14 t52 t32 t51 t52 t57 t73 t8 t15 t76 t80 t60 t42 t44 t72 t54 t80 t44 t47 t70 t80 t10 t13 t12 t20 t7 t12 t24 t84 t53 t80 t12 t35 t26 t23 t74 t5 t33 t63 t63 t54 t44 t56.\n\nSo the first t is t56, which would come from NT8 \u2192 t56.\n\nThen t14 comes from NT2 \u2192 t14.\n\nThen t52 comes from NT8 \u2192 t52? Because in the grammar, there is NT8 \u2192 t52.\n\nSo let's try to see if we can derive this sequence step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's getting too long, and without knowing the exact parse tree, it's hard to be certain.

{"custom_id":"request-799","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a. Each production has two non-terminals on the right or a terminal. \n\nThe given string is a series of t terms like 't62', 't72', etc. Looking at the grammar, I can see that many symbols end directly with a terminal. For example, NT7 -> t13, NT0 -> t23, etc. So the grammar seems to assign specific terminal strings to non-terminals. \n\nFirst, I'll check if each 't' in the string corresponds to a production from the grammar. So, I need to map each 't' number to a non-terminal that produces it. \n\nLet's take each 't' token and see if it's present in the grammar as a terminal:\n\nt62: Looking through the productions, I see NT3 -> 't62' and NT5 -> 't62'. So t62 can be produced by NT3, and possibly others.\n\nt72: Is there a non-terminal that produces t72? Yes, looking at the grammar, NT7 -> t72? Wait, no. Wait, looking at the productions, I see NT2 -> 't7' and others. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong place. Let me check the grammar again. \n\nLooking through the grammar, I see lines like NT3 -> 't72'. So NT3 can produce t72. So t72 is from NT3.\n\nt83: Hmm, let's see. Looking for 't83' as a terminal. Scanning through the productions, I notice NT6 -> 't83' in one place. So t83 is from NT6.\n\nt54: Checking the productions, NT4 -> 't54' is present. So t54 comes from NT4.\n\nt69: Looking for 't69' in the grammar. I see NT3 -> 't69', so t69 is from NT3.\n\nt20: Checking productions, NT7 -> 't20' is present. So t20 is from NT7.\n\nt14: In the grammar, NT2 -> 't14' is present. So t14 is NT2.\n\nt22: Check NT production lines. Yes, NT2 -> t22 is present, so t22 is NT2.\n\nt67: NT6 -> 't67' is present, so t67 is from NT6.\n\nt70: NT7 -> t70 is a production, so t70 is NT7.\n\nt42: Checking the grammar, NT8 -> 't42' is present. So t42 is NT8.\n\nNow, moving to the next tokens:\n\nt61: Looking for 't61'. NT0 -> 't61' is present. So t61 is NT0.\n\nt74: Checking productions, NT3 -> 't74' is present. So t74 is NT3.\n\nt70 again, which is NT7 as before.\n\nt61 again, same as before, NT0.\n\nt39: Looking for 't39'. NT0 -> 't39' is present. So t39 is NT0.\n\nt81: Checking productions, I see NT0 -> 't81' and NT5 -> 't81' if I remember correctly. So t81 can come from NT0 or NT5.\n\nt81 again.\n\nt39 again.\n\nt84: Checking for 't84' as a terminal. I see NT4 -> 't84' is present, so t84 is NT4.\n\nt44: Looking for 't44'. NT5 -> 't44' is a production. So t44 is NT5.\n\nt32: Checking, NT7 -> 't32' is present. So t32 is NT7.\n\nt12: NT0 -> 't12' is present. So t12 is NT0.\n\nt72: As before, t72 is NT3.\n\nt63: Checking, NT3 -> 't63' is present. So t63 is NT3.\n\nt12 again.\n\nt8: Looking for 't8'. NT3 -> 't8' is present. So t8 is NT3.\n\nt33: Checking, NT5 -> 't33' is a production. So t33 is NT5.\n\nt62: NT3 as before.\n\nt72 again.\n\nt20 again, NT7.\n\nt22 again, NT2.\n\nt81 again, which is NT0 or NT5.\n\nt21: Looking for 't21'. Hmm, in the productions, I see NT6 -> 't21' is present. So t21 comes from NT6.\n\nt57: Checking, NT7 -> 't57' is a production. So t57 is NT7.\n\nt31: Looking for 't31'. NT5 -> 't31' is present. So t31 is NT5.\n\nt80: NT8 -> 't80' is present, so t80 is NT8.\n\nt73: Checking, NT0 -> 't73' is a production, yes. So t73 is NT0.\n\nt56: Looking for 't56', NT8 -> 't56' is present. So t56 is NT8.\n\nt83 again, which is NT6.\n\nt15: Checking, NT7 -> 't15' is present. So t15 is NT7.\n\nt77: NT6 -> 't77' is present. So t77 is NT6.\n\nt17: Looking for 't17'. NT0 -> 't17' is present. So t17 is NT0.\n\nSo, each 't' in the string corresponds to a production in the grammar. Now, assuming the entire string can be derived through these productions, it's possible that this string is generated by the grammar. However, I need to ensure that the leftmost derivations are compatible with the grammar's structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production on the right side is two non-terminals. So, the derivations will likely involve combining these non-terminals step by step. Also, it's important to note that some non-terminals can have multiple productions, so different paths might be possible.\n\nAnother thing to check is the overall structure. The string starts with 't62', which is from NT3. Let's see what NT3 can produce: NT3 -> 't62' or other options. Looking at the grammar, NT3 has several productions. Wait, in the initial productions, I see that NT3 can produce multiple things like 't72', 't39', etc. But in our string, the first non-terminal is 't62', which is a terminal, so it's directly produced.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Each 't' is a terminal, so in the string, each 't' must be directly derived from a non-terminal that produces it as a terminal. So, if each 't' in the string is present in the grammar as a terminal, then as long as there's a way to combine the non-terminals to match the entire structure, it should be possible.\n\nFor example, the first token is 't62', so from NT3. Then the next is 't72' from NT3. But wait, in the grammar, NT3 can only produce one terminal in each production. So, after producing 't62', can we have another production that starts with NT3 again? Or would it require another non-terminal?\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think more clearly. The grammar is in CNF, which means each production has exactly two non-terminals or a terminal. So, the parse tree will consist of a binary tree where the leaves are the terminals.\n\nIn our case, all the tokens are terminals that appear as production bodies in the grammar. So each 't' is a terminal, and it's produced by some non-terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string can be generated if there's a way to combine the non-terminals in such a way that each token is the terminal produced by some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nSo, in this case, each 't' can be matched to a non-terminal, and as there are no conflicts (each 't' is uniquely matched to at least one non-terminal), the string can be generated. Therefore, the answer should be 'Yes'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string can be derived from the context-free grammar, as each token corresponds to a non-terminal's production in the grammar.\n\nAnswer: Yes"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-811","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is a bunch of tokens separated by spaces. \n\nFirst off, I remember that CNF grammars have rules where each production is a non-terminal symbol that expands into two other non-terminals, or a single terminal. That might complicate things a bit, but let's see.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that the start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So the string we need to check should start with whatever NT0 and NT4 generate.\n\nThe string provided is quite long, but each token like 't10', 't12', etc., are terminals. So the question is: can this sequence of terminal tokens be derived from the starting symbols using the given productions?\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar. Since it's a CNF grammar, we can use the CYK algorithm, but parsing each token step by step might help.\n\nAlternatively, looking for dependencies: each production can only take at most one step, so building a parse tree might be manageable. But given the length, maybe it's better to see if all the terminals are accounted for.\n\nWait, another thought: since the grammar is in CNF, it's a binary tree, and the height of the tree would be logarithmic relative to the length of the string. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each terminal in the string occurs as a left-hand side of a production. Looking at the grammar, the terminal symbols are things like 't10', 't12', etc. So if each of these terminals is actually a production in the grammar, they can be derived directly.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has a list of terminal rules. Let me check the grammar:\n\nLooking through the productions, there are several that have the form NTx -> txx. For example, NT12 -> t14, NT9 -> t43, etc. So, each of these terminals is a terminal production.\n\nSo, if each token in the string is one of the right-hand sides of the productions, then each token can be derived from a non-terminal. That is, each token is a single terminal that appears as a rule in the grammar.\n\nSo, for example, 't10' must be derived from some NTx where NTx -> t10 is a production. Looking through the list, I see that NT4 -> t32 is a production. Wait, so 't10' isn't directly a terminal in any production. Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, let me scan the productions again. I see:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't32'\nNT7 -> 't76'\nNT4 -> 't8'\nNT3 -> 't53'\nNT8 -> 't73'\nNT8 -> 't77'\nNT3 -> 't69'\nNT9 -> 't79'\nAnd others. Hmm, so for 't10', I don't see any production like NTx -> t10. So that would mean 't10' cannot be derived from any non-terminal, but it's a terminal in the input string.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If the string has a token that isn't the RHS of any production, then it's not in the language. Because in the grammar, all terminals are direct, so if any token isn't covered, the string can't be generated.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The string is: t10 t12 t33 t52 t5 t14 t28 t63 t61 t32 t39 t5 t5 t52 t24 t23 t80 t33 t39 t51 t5 t84 t33 t13 t81 t13 t84 t62 t42 t81 t27 t53 t67 t42 t73 t81 t42 t42 t3 t64 t8 t35 t67 t31 t5.\n\nLooking at each token: t10 is not present in any of the productions. The productions for terminals are listed above, and I don't see 't10' anywhere. So that would mean 't10' is not a terminal in the grammar's terminal set, thus making the string ungenerable by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, could I have missed any production that results in 't10'? Let me go through the grammar again. Going through each production, I don't see any with RHS t10. So 't10' is not a terminal in this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string can't be generated because it contains a terminal 't10' which is not defined in any production rule of the grammar.\n\nSo the answer must be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Each non-terminal eventually eventually resolves into a terminal string, which in this case consists of 't' followed by some number.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t37 t62 t73 t23 t60 t35 t21 t33 t3 t80 t13 t9 t9 t5 t15 t80 t10 t61 t31 t76 t12 t20 t32 t56 t10 t63 t56 t72 t31 t31 t39 t44 t9 t3 t14 t37 t63 t24 t84 t80 t52 t12 t37 t2 t63.\n\nLooking at the last few tokens, I notice sequences of 't's. For example, there's t9 t9, t14, t63 t63 t56 etc. Since the string is quite long, I think the key here is to represent the string as a sequence of non-terminals and see if they can derive into the given terminals.\n\nLet's break it down step by step. The start symbol S produces NT0 and NT4. So, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Now, each NT is a non-terminal, so I need to see what each of these can produce.\n\nNT0 appears in several productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. Similarly, NT4 appears in multiple rules like NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, etc. Each of these non-terminals eventually resolves to a terminal string.\n\nGiven that each step of the grammar replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals, the entire string must be a derivation of these replacements leading to the terminals observed. Essentially, the string should consist of a series of such steps, each generating more tokens until the entire string is exhausted.\n\nLooking at the first token, t37, I need to see which non-terminal could directly produce it. Looking back at the grammar, I see rules where certain non-terminals produce 't' followed by a number. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', NT4 \u2192 't32', NT5 \u2192 't47', etc. So, I need to check if each token corresponds to a production that can be derived from the grammar's rules.\n\nFor instance, the first token is t37. Looking through the grammar, I don't immediately see an NT that directly produces t37. Wait, let me check all the 't' rules to see if any non-terminal directly produces 't37'. Scanning the list, I find NT4 \u2192 't37', among others like NT8 \u2192 't5', etc. Wait, correction: Looking back, I think NT4 \u2192 't37' is one of the rules. So NT4 can produce t37.\n\nSo if the string starts with t37, that could imply that the initial productions derive from NT4, which then breaks down into more non-terminals leading down to the terminal.\n\nBut wait, the grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first expansion would be NT0 followed by NT4. Let's see what NT0 can do. NT0 can go to NT6 NT7 or others. Let's see:\n\nIf NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and NT6 can go to NT9 NT8 or others. But looking at the string, the first token is t37, which is produced by NT4. So perhaps the initial derivation is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and then NT4 is expanded to t37. But then, what about the rest of the string?\n\nWait, the string is t37 followed by other tokens, so if S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and NT4 \u2192 t37, then the string starts with NT4, producing t37, and the rest should be generated by NT0. So NT0 would have to generate the rest.\n\nBut looking at NT0, it can expand into various non-terminals. For example, NT0 can be NT6 NT7. So perhaps NT0 is expanding into a sequence that starts with NT6 or NT7, and so on.\n\nBut the string after t37 is t62, which must come from NT0 or another non-terminal. Let me check what each non-terminal produces. For example, looking for 't62' in the 't' rules. In the grammar, NT8 \u2192 't64', NT4 \u2192 't23', etc. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me scan the grammar for 't62'.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see NT8 \u2192 't5', NT4 \u2192 't23', etc. I think I need to look through each line. Let me check again:\n\nLooking for 't62' as a terminal. Scanning through the list, I don't immediately see any NT \u2192 't62'. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Let me go through each production:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT4 \u2192 t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t15\n- NT7 \u2192 t33\n- NT6 \u2192 t83\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t32\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT8 \u2192 t21\n- NT5 \u2192 t27\n- NT0 \u2192 t43\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t43\n- NT6 \u2192 t61\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT8 \u2192 t77\n- NT6 \u2192 t43\n- NT7 \u2192 t33\n- NT6 \u2192 t69\n- NT8 \u2192 t56\n- NT3 \u2192 t2\n- NT8 \u2192 t73\n- NT6 \u2192 t61\n- NT8 \u2192 t80\n- NT8 \u2192 t81\n- NT0 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\n- NT4 \u2192 t27\n- NT0 \u2192 t62\nWait, here's one: NT0 \u2192 't62'. So NT0 can produce t62. That's useful.\n\nSo the string after t37 is t62. So perhaps the derivation is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, NT4 \u2192 t37, NT0 \u2192 t62 followed by more tokens. Wait, but NT0 can produce multiple non-terminals, so it might not directly produce t62. Instead, NT0 would have to go through a chain of productions until it reaches the terminal.\n\nWait, maybe the initial idea was wrong. Let's think differently. Each non-terminal expands into two non-terminals, but in the end, they all have to resolve into terminals. So the string is a concatenation of these terminals generated step by step.\n\nTo verify if the string is generated, each token must correspond to some terminal that can be derived from the starting point. So perhaps it's easier to reverse-engineer the string, starting from the end and seeing if it can trace back to the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try that approach. The last token in the string is t63. Looking for which non-terminal can produce t63. Scanning the grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 t63? Let me check the rules:\n\nLooking for any NT \u2192 t63. Scanning through the rules, I don't see any. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each line again to see if any NT produces t63.\n\nActually, I think I might have missed the specific one. Let's check NT5 \u2192 t39. Hmm, no. I think I need to check if any NT has a rule that ends with 't63'. Looking through the list, I find: NT8 \u2192 t21, NT5 \u2192 t15, etc. Wait, perhaps NT2 produces t63. Looking at the grammar, I see a line: NT2 \u2192 t7. That's not it. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check all the lines where the production is NTx \u2192 t followed by a number. I'll list them out:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT4 \u2192 t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t15\n- NT7 \u2192 t33\n- NT6 \u2192 t83\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT4 \u2192 t32"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-826","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string in question is pretty long. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. CNF has a very specific structure: each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can go directly to a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, every production rule must have exactly two non-terminals, except possibly the start symbol, which might produce a single terminal. Hmm. Wait, actually, the start symbol can produce a terminal, but all non-terminals must expand into two non-terminals. So, in this case, looking at the grammar, I should check if all non-terminals on the right are non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that most rules have two non-terminals, and there are some that have a terminal. For example, NT2 -> 't14' or NT9 -> 't43'. Ah, so in this case, the grammar isn't in strict CNF because it has rules with a single terminal on the RHS. Wait, no\u2014Chomsky Normal Form doesn't require all productions to have exactly two non-terminals; it's allowed for the start symbol to have a single terminal. But wait, is that correct? Let me recall: CNF requires that all productions be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But for the purpose of this problem, since the grammar includes rules with terminals, it's effectively in GNF, perhaps, but the question states it's in CNF. Hmm, maybe the confusion arises because sometimes GNF is used when allowing terminals, while CNF requires each production to have exactly two non-terminals except the start symbol, which can have a terminal.\n\nWait, but the grammar has rules like S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S is expanding into two non-terminals. Similarly, the other non-terminals like NT7 -> NT0 NT2. Some have a mix of terminals and non-terminals in their rules, which seems to go against CNF. So perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me go through a few rules again.\n\nLooking at NT2 -> 't14'. That's a terminal, so that's okay if NT2 is the start symbol. But in this case, S is the start symbol, so the grammar starts with S. So maybe NT2 could be a terminal, but perhaps not. Wait, S is the start symbol, and it's defined as NT0 NT4. So we start with S, which is two non-terminals. Each of those needs to expand, perhaps.\n\nBut given that, perhaps the grammar is a mix, which might complicate things. However, I'm not sure. The key point is that the grammar is presented as being in CNF. So maybe all productions except the start symbol are in CNF, but the start symbol can have a single terminal. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the grammar, all non-terminals on the RHS are non-terminals, except when the start symbol is allowed to have a terminal. So maybe some of these terminal productions are allowed for the start symbol. For example, S could have a direct terminal. But in that case, S is defined as NT0 NT4, which are non-terminals, so S can't directly produce a terminal. Therefore, perhaps in this grammar, the only terminals are those that appear as terminals in the RHS, like 't14', 't84', etc.\n\nSo, to parse a string, I need to see if it can be generated by this grammar starting from S and expanding all non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven the string: t14 t84 t21 t21 t77 t39 t3 t14 t12 t64 t64 t12 t70 t3 t21 t53 t64 t47 t27 t67 t28 t22 t54 t84 t83 t84 t72 t60 t60 t39 t7 t60 t11 t80 t3 t47 t53 t31 t72 t35 t17 t9 t10 t47 t20 t52.\n\nThat's a lot of tokens. I need to check if each token can be matched by some rule in the grammar, starting from S.\n\nBut to get a grip on this, perhaps I can start by looking for the start symbol S, which is NT0 NT4. So each of these must be expanded as well.\n\nNT0 and NT4 are both non-terminals. Let's see their productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT2 -> NT7 NT2\n\nWait, this looks recursive. Maybe there's a loop here that could produce a string indefinitely. Similarly, NT4's production is complex.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into sequences that match the productions.\n\nLet's start by looking at the string and see if the first few tokens can be linked to any non-terminals.\n\nThe first token is 't14'. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals produce 't14'? It's in NT2 -> 't14' and perhaps others. Let's check.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\n- NT2 -> 't14'\n- NT9 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't28'\n- NT3 -> 't60'\n- NT9 -> 't70'\n- NT8 -> 't64'\n- Other rules may produce more terminals, but these are the ones I can see from the given rules.\n\nSo the first token is 't14', which must come from NT2. So then, let's consider where NT2 fits into the production rules.\n\nLooking at the rules for NT2:\n\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT6\n\nSo NT2 is NT3 and NT6. Now, we need to expand NT3 and NT6.\n\nLooking at NT3:\n\nFrom the list:\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't10'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT3 -> 't70'\n- NT3 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't21'\n- NT3 -> 't69'\n- Another rule: NT3 -> 't33'?\n\nWait, the list is extensive. Let's pick the first one: 't72'. If we choose NT3 -> 't72', then 't72' would be the next token. But the second token is 't84', which doesn't match. Alternatively, if NT3 is expanded via another rule, like perhaps 't39', but that would require a series of expansions. Alternatively, maybe NT2's other production is considered, but looking at the grammar for NT2:\n\nNT2: NT3 NT6. So when NT2 is expanded, it becomes NT3 and NT6. Now, each of those must be expanded into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nSo, for instance, if NT2 -> NT3 NT6, then we need to see what NT3 and NT6 produce. Let's see:\n\nSuppose NT3 is expanded into 't14', but no, 't14' is from NT2, but that would require NT2 to produce 't14' directly, which it doesn't. Instead, NT2 must produce NT3 NT6, and each of those must eventually produce a terminal.\n\nWait, but the first token is 't14', so that suggests that the first production is NT2 -> 't14', but that's not possible because NT2's rule is NT3 NT6, unless NT3 or NT6 can produce that.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a confusion in how the grammar is presented. Maybe the grammar is not in CNF, but the problem states it is. So perhaps all non-terminals are on the LHS, and each production has exactly two non-terminals on the RHS.\n\nWait, looking back at the grammar:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\n\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT2 -> NT3 NT6\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nAnd so on. So yes, most productions have two non-terminals on RHS. But some have a mix, like NT9 -> 't43', which is a terminal. Wait, but in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions except the initial one must be of the form A \u2192 BC where A, B, C are non-terminals. The start symbol can produce a terminal. So perhaps S is the only non-terminal that can produce a terminal, but in this case, all productions for S and others lead to"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

So this is a CFG in Chomsky normal form, which means all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nI think the approach is to parse the string using this grammar, treating each 't' followed by two digits as a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of terminals.\n\nTo check if the string is generated by the grammar, I can try to build a parse tree or use a parsing algorithm. Since the grammar is in CNF, a bottom-up parsing method like the CYK algorithm might be suitable, but manually doing that with 43 tokens is tedious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or see if each terminal in the string can be derived by some production in the grammar, respecting the structure.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe the better approach is to see if the string can be parsed step by step, starting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and trying to split the string into parts that correspond to these productions.\n\nWait, but since it's a right-derivation, we can try to parse the string by splitting it into substrings that match the left-hand sides of the productions.\n\nLet me try to break down the string.\n\nThe string is: t43 t81 t62 t62 t17 t73 t61 t5 t7 t9 t43 t53 t40 t67 t63 t33 t47 t24 t5 t33 t77 t32 t44 t32 t3 t2 t52 t47 t54 t57 t47 t76 t13 t47 t35 t63 t47 t21 t73 t8 t42 t64 t69 t69 t24 t8.\n\nEach 't' followed by two digits is a terminal. So there are 43 such terminals.\n\nNow, the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first step is to have NT0 produce a substring and NT4 produce another. So the string must be divided into two parts that correspond to the derivations of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me look at the start of the string: t43 t81 t62 t62 t17...\n\nI need to find if there's a production that starts with t43. Looking at the grammar, for NT0, the rules that produce t43 are:\n\nLooking through the NT0 productions... Oh wait, in the given grammar, NT0 has multiple productions. Let's see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT6\nWait, I don't see any rule where NT0 directly produces t43. Or do I?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. The NT0 rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5 (multiple times)\nNT0 -> NT5 NT2\nWait, but in the grammar provided, I need to check which non-terminals directly produce a 't' terminal.\n\nWait, no, the NT productions might have rules where non-terminals on the right produce a terminal and another non-terminal, etc.\n\nBut for the given string, I need to see if each terminal can be matched by the left-hand side of some rule, or if a non-terminal can produce a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to construct the parse tree step by step.\n\nBut with the complexity, perhaps it's easier to simulate a top-down parse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm. Let's attempt to model this.\n\nGiven the string length is 43, which is manageable, but doing it manually is time-consuming.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that in the beginning, NT0 and NT4 must split the string. Let's check if the first token is 't43'. Looking at the grammar, NT4 can produce 't43' from NT7:\n\nBecause in the grammar, NT7 has a production NT7 -> NT13, which then... Wait, in the given grammar, I see that NT7 has rules. Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\nNT7 -> NT13 NT4? Wait no, looking carefully, the grammar for NT6 is a bit complex.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to look for the first token t43. In the given grammar, I notice that NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't72', and NT6 has 't83', and others. Wait, looking through the grammar:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the grammar, the NT productions directly produce 't':\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT6 -> 't83'\nNT8 -> 't5'\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT4 -> 't84'\nNT9 -> 't60'\nNT0 -> 't43' (Wait, earlier in the grammar, under NT0: NT0 -> 't43'?\n\nWait, no. Oh, looking again:\n\nNo, the lines under NT0 and other non-terminals produce various terminals. For example, in the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' (from earlier entries, e.g., NT0 -> NT5 NT5 and NT0 -> NT2 ...)\nWait, but more importantly, some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT0 -> 't43' (Wait, does any NT0 have a direct production of 't43'? Looking through the grammar:\n\nLooking at NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7? Wait, so if NT6 can produce a terminal and NT7 another terminal, then NT0 can produce a sequence.\n\nBut let me check all the NT rules. For example, NT6 can produce 't83', so if NT6 is in the production, and NT7 produces a terminal like 't13', then NT0 -> NT6 NT7 would lead to 't83 t13', which is 't83t13'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is 't43', so perhaps NT0 produces 't43' via some rule.\n\nWait, let me check all the NT rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar lines:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT5 -> 't33' (multiple times)\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't3' (Wait, maybe that's under a different rule? Or is it an error? Looking, I see under NT5: \"NT5-> NT5 NT6\" and other rules, but one line says \"NT5-> 't3'\". Wait, this is the production rule, so yes, NT5 can directly produce 't3'.\n\nWait, but looking through the grammar, I see that some lines have NT... -> 't...'. For example, line:\n\nNT3 -> 't72'\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT5 -> 't3'\nNT6 -> 't83'\nNT8 -> 't5'\n...\n\nSo NT5 can produce 't3', but that would be helpful if the string starts with that.\n\nBut the string starts with 't43'. So, perhaps another rule.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT0 can produce 't23' (from NT0->'t23'), but where does 't43' come from?\n\nLooking again, perhaps some non-terminals produce 't43' through their rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines: I see that NT7 can produce 't54'? Let me check.\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\n\nWait, that's a production rule. So NT7 can produce 't43' via NT0 (for example). Wait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT0 can produce a longer sequence that includes 't43' as one of the terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that I"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me first try to understand the grammar and then see how the string can be derived step by step.\n\nThe grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, meaning every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4\nEach production seems to consist of two non-terminals on the right side.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t51 t20 t77 t8 t33 t72 t20 t57 t53 t56 t81 t54 t43 t43 t33 t64 t31 t83 t81 t77 t57 t15 t32 t47 t73 t12 t31 t60 t14 t39 t56 t13 t69 t44 t12 t12 t20 t40 t32 t12 t22 t67 t69 t60 t69 t9 t32`.\n\nEach 't' followed by two digits is a terminal symbol. So the string is a sequence of these terminals.\n\nI need to see if the grammar can generate this sequence. Let's break it down.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, the derivation will start with NT0 and NT4. I need to see if each of these can produce the corresponding parts of the string.\n\nLet me look at NT0 and NT4 in the grammar.\n\nFirst, NT0's productions:\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT6\nand others, but mostly involving combinations.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has:\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\nand so on.\n\nI think a bottom-up approach might not work here because the string is quite long, and it's easier to try and see if the entire string can be parsed. Alternatively, I can try to see which parts of the string correspond to the rules.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the string can be split into parts that are products of the grammar's rules. Let's look for substrings that match the non-terminals.\n\nThe first part is 't51 t20 t77 t8...'\n\nLet me check NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0: it can produce various combinations.\n\nLooking at NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 can produce things like NT9 NT8, NT6 NT9, etc. But in the string, after t51, we have t20, which might correspond to NT4, perhaps? Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be built by combining the right-hand sides of the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to approach this as a top-down derivation, but since the string is long, that might take too long. Another way is to check if each step in the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for how the terminals appear in the grammar.\n\nLooking at NT5, for example, which can produce 't47' directly. Also, NT3 can produce 't72', which is in the string at the second position. So part of the string is 't51 t20 t77 t8 t33 t72 t20...'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 't72' is in NT3's productions as NT3 \u2192 't72', so perhaps that's the first step.\n\nLooking at the position of 't51' in the string, perhaps that comes from another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that correspond to the rules. Since each production in the grammar has exactly two symbols on the right, the entire string must be made by concatenating two symbols at a time, possibly including one or more symbols from each step.\n\nBut given that the grammar is in CNF, each step in the derivation is a split into two symbols. So the string can be viewed as a sequence of such splits.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to see that the string can be built as a series of NT productions, ensuring that each pair reduces to the correct part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by checking if the string can be split into a sequence of symbols where each symbol is either a terminal or a non-terminal that can be broken down further.\n\nBut given that the string is quite long, this might take a lot of time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by seeing if the grammar can generate the entire string by checking if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals.\n\nBut perhaps I should look for the initial symbols.\n\nThe initial symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string must be generated by first emitting NT0 and then NT4, each of which may derive to a sequence ending in terminals.\n\nLet me check NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: it can produce NT8 NT6, NT5 NT2, and so on.\n\nLooking at the string, after 't51 t20 t77 t8', perhaps NT4 can produce a part here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to break the string into parts and see if each part matches the productions.\n\nBut given the time, maybe it's better to see if all the terminals in the string can be matched by the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the given string, I see various 't's followed by numbers, like 't51', 't20', 't77', 't8', etc. I need to check if each of these can be derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, many 't's correspond to specific non-terminals:\n\n- 't47' is directly from NT5\n- 't72' is from NT3\n- 't52' from NT6\n- 't14' from NT2\n- 't33' from NT4\n- 't23' from NT5\n- 't83' from NT8\n- 't39' from NT3\n- 't56' from NT8\n- 't74' from NT4\n- 't43' from NT6\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, I can see that each of these 't's is either a terminal production or comes from a non-terminal.\n\nSo, if all the terminals in the string can be generated by the grammar, then the string could be generated.\n\nBut perhaps some are ambiguous.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 't51' is from NT3 via NT3 \u2192 't51'\nWait, in the grammar, looking at NT3's productions, 't51' is one of them, right? Let me check:\n\nLooking back, yes, in the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't51'.\n\nSimilarly, 't20' is... Hmm, 't20' is from NT3 via NT3 \u2192 't20'? No, wait. Let me check the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't72', 't76', 't53', 't59', 't39', etc. Wait, I don't see 't20' being directly produced by any NT3. So perhaps 't20' comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps 't20' comes from NT5?\n\nLooking at NT5's productions: yes, NT5 can produce 't47'. But where does 't20' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps 't20' is not directly in any of the productions, so that might be an issue. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces 't20'. All the terminals are specific letters followed by numbers, like 't47', 't72', etc.\n\nSo 't20' is not directly produced by any non-terminal, which would mean that the string contains a terminal that's not present in the grammar, making the string invalid.\n\nWait, let me verify this. I'll scan through the grammar for any production that ends with 't20'.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\nI don't see any production where the right-hand side is just 't20'. All the terminals are specific to certain non-terminals, like NT3's 't72', NT5's 't47', etc. So 't20' is not present in the grammar's terminals.

The grammar is pretty complex, with a bunch of production rules. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. Chomsky normal form (CNF) usually means each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-849","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. The grammar is pretty complex with a lot of production rules, and the string is quite long with a sequence of symbols like 't73', 't79', etc. \n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form entails. It requires that every production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and a is a terminal. But looking at the provided grammar, some rules have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side, like S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which is okay because it starts with a non-terminal and then two, but actually, in Chomsky Nf, each production must have exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals directly. Wait, no, S would typically go to two non-terminals which then expand until terminals are reached. So I need to check if all rules comply, but perhaps the user already provided it in CNF, so I can proceed assuming that.\n\nNext, the task is to see if the string can be generated by the grammar. I'm thinking of using the CYK algorithm for parsing, which is designed for context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form. Since the string is quite long, I might need to perform this step-by-step, but it's going to be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or specific production routes that could generate the string. \n\nLooking at the string: it's a series of 't's with numbers. The terminals are 't73', 't79', etc. I notice that each terminal starts with a 't' and a number, which likely corresponds to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. For example, in the grammar, certain non-terminals like NT0, NT1, etc., produce these terminals. So perhaps mapping each terminal to potential non-terminals it can be derived from would be useful.\n\nFor instance, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT5 -> 't47' and 't3', so it can produce 't47' directly or via another non-terminal leading to 't3' (which is 't3' being NT3's production). Similarly, NT7 has several terminals, such as 't73' from NT7 -> 't73'. Wait, checking the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 has a production 't73' via NT7 -> 't73'. So if 't73' is present in the string, maybe it was generated directly from NT7.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, the rules for NT7 are multiple. For example:\n\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nAnd also other rules like NT7 -> NT7 NT0, NT7 -> NT7 NT6, etc., but looking more carefully, I see some rules where NT7 directly produce the terminals:\n\nYes, indeed, looking through the grammar provided, I notice that NT7 has a production NT7 -> 't73', so that's a direct production. Similarly, NT9 has 't60' as a direct production, and so on.\n\nSo, in the string, looking for instances where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal would help find possible steps in the derivation.\n\nBut the string is quite long. I think I'll approach this by noting the order of how the non-terminals can be constructed and whether the entire string can be constructed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify all the terminals in the string and see if each terminal can be generated by any non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nThe string is: t73 t79 t61 t63 t22 t17 t32 t60 t39 t9 t74 t35 t74 t21 t33 t27 t32 t37 t42 t80 t22 t31 t76 t81 t61 t17 t15 t27 t52 t51 t39 t21 t60 t42 t43 t3 t12 t69 t84 t3 t24 t62 t53 t17 t77 t70 t12 t37.\n\nSo, each 't' followed by a number is a terminal, which corresponds to a specific production. I'll need to see for each of these terminals which non-terminals can derive them.\n\nFor example:\n\n- t73: Looking at the grammar, there's a rule NT7 -> 't73', so NT7 can produce t73.\n\n- t79: Similarly, check grammar for NT7; is there a rule that produces t79? Scanning through, I don't immediately see a rule for NT7 that produces t79. Wait, looking back, I see NT9 -> 't60' and others, but maybe another non-terminal. Wait, perhaps looking through all production rules, I see NT7 only has 't73' as a direct production. So where does t79 come from? Hmm, perhaps a longer derivation. For example, maybe NT7 -> NT4 NT0, and then NT4 can produce something else.\n\nSimilarly, other terminals like t22, t17, etc., need to be mapped to their possible sources.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to think about the entire string and see if it can be broken down into segments where each segment is generated by a non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut considering the length of the string, it might be impractical to do this manually. So perhaps I can perform a top-down parsing, using the CYK algorithm, but manually for just a portion, or check if the string has any segments that can't be generated.\n\nWait, another approach: in the grammar, the terminals are generated by non-terminals directly, so perhaps I can map each terminal to a non-terminal and see if all of them can be matched in the derivation order.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should instead look for a key non-terminal that might derive a long sequence of terminals, such as S, since S is the start symbol and the top of the derivation tree.\n\nLooking at S, it produces NT0 NT4. So the root is S -> NT0 NT4. Then, NT0 and NT4 can produce further non-terminals. For example, NT0 can produce NT9 NT7 or other combinations. \n\nBut given the string, perhaps the first few symbols derive to NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t73, which comes from NT7. So maybe NT7 is generated first. But S starts with NT0 and NT4.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's an issue because the string starts with t73, which is from NT7, but S would have to derive to NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, maybe the grammar has S -> NT0 NT4, so the entire string must be a combination of what NT0 and NT4 can generate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another thought: in Chomsky normal form, each production has exactly two non-terminals, except for terminals. So each step a symbol is replaced by two symbols, which can eventually lead to terminals.\n\nBut perhaps the string length is 53 symbols, which would require the string to be of length 2^k, but 53 is not a power of two, so perhaps it's possible, but it's more about the arrangement.\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to note that each NT in the grammar only produces two symbols, but sometimes it's terminals. So for example, NT7 can produce t73 directly, or it can produce two non-terminals which then produce other symbols.\n\nSo maybe the string can be built by following the production steps.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal. For example, t73 from NT7, t79 perhaps from NT7 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the grammar, I see that NT9 can produce 't60', which is not in the string. So perhaps another non-terminal is needed for t79.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t79 comes from NT0 producing other non-terminals that eventually lead to t79.\n\nBut this process is quite involved. Instead, perhaps I can look for whether there are any symbols in the string that are impossible. For instance, if a certain symbol can't be produced by any non-terminal, then the answer is No.\n\nWait, stepping through each symbol:\n\nThe string starts with t73, which comes from NT7. Then t79: looking through the grammar, does any non-terminal produce t79? Looking at the production rules for each NT, I don't see any rule where 't79' is directly produced. So is that possible?\n\nWait, wait, let me scan the grammar again. Looking for any rules that produce 't79'.\n\nLooking through, the rules provided include:\n\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n\n- NT5 -> 't47' and 't3'\n\n- NT3 -> 't53' etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any NT that directly produce 't79'.

{"custom_id":"request-856","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's see what I need to do here. So, the user provided a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a specific string to check if it's generated by this grammar. My job is to figure out whether the string is in the language defined by the given grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar structure. It looks like all the non-terminals (like S, NT0, NT2, etc.) are defined by production rules that break them down into other non-terminals and eventually into terminals, which are the 't' followed by numbers like 't31', 't53', etc. The start symbol is S, which is defined as NT0 NT4. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and from there, the string is built up through a series of productions until terminals are reached.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals: t31 t53 t9 t60 t26 t70 t20 t51 t12 t40 t37 t17 t77 t77 t12 t24 t81 t23 t63 t77 t81 t81 t32 t63 t54 t54 t21 t56 t24 t20 t39 t24 t22 t21 t51 t51 t79 t10 t24 t20 t51 t43 t12 t73 t3. I'll need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nTo approach this, I'll think about parsing strategies. Since the grammar is in CNF (Chomsky normal form), which is a form where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Here, the productions are indeed all binary or single terminals, so the grammar is suitable for parsing with algorithms like the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing.\n\nBut CYK might be a bit complicated here since the string is long, and the grammar is extensive. Maybe a better approach is to try to map the string back through the grammar by breaking it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a concatenation of terminals, so each of these must be produced by some rule in the grammar.\n\nLet me start by looking for possible decompositions. The start symbol S is NT0 NT4. So the string must start with a derivation from NT0 followed by a derivation from NT4.\n\nLet's split the string into parts. The first part is up to the first space, which is 't31'. But wait, actually, in the string, each 't' is followed by a number, so each is a distinct terminal.\n\nWait, let me clarify. In the given string, it's written as `t31 t53 t9 t60 ...`, which actually represents a sequence of terminal symbols. Each 't' is a distinct terminal. So for example, 't31' is one terminal, 't53' another, and so on. So in reality, each element separated by a space is a single terminal symbol.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in Chomsky normal form, each production has two non-terminals at most. So the string must consist of a sequence of terminals that are the result of expanding these non-terminals.\n\nI think I might have misinterpreted the input. Maybe each 't' is part of the same symbol. Oh, wait, no, looking back, the Grammar entries have strings like NT0 -> t23, which suggests that NT0 is replaced by a single terminal 't23'. So each production leads to combinations of terminals and non-terminals, but for the string to be generated, it's a matter of expanding the start symbol (S) into a sequence of terminals, matching exactly the given string.\n\nWait, no, the string is a sequence of terminals, each being one 't' followed by a number. So each 't' is a distinct terminal symbol. Wait, that can't be right because in the grammar, each production for a non-terminal can produce a single terminal or a combination. So perhaps each 't' is a single symbol.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify. In Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a single terminal symbol. So in the grammar, for example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, where NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals. So the string must be built by expanding these non-terminals into sequences of terminals.\n\nEach terminal in the string is a separate symbol, so for example, 't31' is a terminal, and each such 't' followed by a number is a single symbol.\n\nWait, but in the string, each 't' is a single character with a number. So each 'tX' is a single terminal symbol. Therefore, the entire string is 47 symbols long, each being 't' followed by a number. So the problem is to see if the derivation from the start symbol can produce exactly this sequence of 47 terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar has complex production rules, this manual approach would be time-consuming. I might need to look for common patterns or perhaps find the sequence of non-terminals that can generate such a string.\n\nAlternatively, I can trace the string backward, trying to find possible expansions from the end.\n\nAnother approach is to see if the string can be processed as a series of rules in the grammar. But given the length of the string, it's quite daunting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can identify which terminals appear in the string and check their possible origin in the grammar. For example, does the grammar produce 't79'? Looking at the grammar, I see NT8 -> t53, and NT5 -> t51. But NT9 -> t43, which is a single terminal. So 't9' is a single terminal, perhaps.\n\nWait, in the grammar, looking at the productions, I see that NT4 can be broken down into other non-terminals. For instance, NT4 can produce NT5 and NT2, and so on. To get a terminal, one of these non-terminals must have a production that ends with a terminal.\n\nLooking at the productions, let's see which non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 has several rules, including NT9 NT7, NT4 NT0, etc. Some of these may lead to terminals. Wait, but most seem to produce other non-terminals. For example, NT0 can produce NT6 NT7, and NT6 can produce NT9 NT8, and so on. It seems that many non-terminals ultimately produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's look for any non-terminals that directly produce a single terminal, i.e., A \u2192 a.\n\nLooking through the productions, for example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7' : so NT2 \u2192 t7\n- NT3 -> t53\n- NT5 -> t47\n- NT7 -> t17\n- NT8 -> t57\n- NT9 -> t60\n- NT4 -> t37\n- NT4 -> t28\n- NT7 -> t84\n- NT0 -> t23\n- NT5 -> t10\n- NT3 -> t31\n- NT5 -> t39\n- NT3 -> t12\n- NT0 -> t40\n- NT7 -> t77\n- NT7 -> t76\n- NT6 -> t83\n- NT8 -> t51\n- NT5 -> t3 (wait, that might be a typo, but assuming it's correct)\n- NT4 -> t42\n- And so on.\n\nSo, each production that ends with 'a' (a single terminal) is accessible. For example, NT2 \u2192 t7, so any occurrence of the non-terminal NT2 in the derivation must be expanded into t7.\n\nSimilarly, NT3 can be expanded into t53, t31, etc.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can process the string by looking for the possible origins of each terminal.\n\nWait, but processing 47 terminals manually is going to be too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the derivation steps.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string ends with t3, which is from NT5 \u2192 t3? Looking at the grammar, I see NT5 \u2192 t3. But in the expansion, we might have more steps.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nNT5 has productions:\n- NT5 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT5 -> NT7 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT5 -> NT3 NT2\nWait, no, looking at the user's grammar, the productions are:\n\nLooking back, I'm a bit confused as the grammar provided is quite extensive with many entries. Wait, perhaps the user hasn't written it correctly, but in any case, let's try to parse the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some rule in the grammar, and see if their possible derivations can connect.\n\nBut maybe, for example, 't31' can be from NT3 \u2192 t31 (assuming that exists).

The string to check is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are the result of expanding the non-terminals.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the structure of the grammar and the string. The string is: `t43 t53 t11 t20 t3 t3 t43 t22 t81 t12 t52 t79 t37 t60 t79 t72 t81 t33 t69 t62 t27 t80 t15 t40 t26 t3 t8 t5 t9 t5 t27 t53 t63 t52 t52 t70 t72 t2 t62 t60 t3 t35 t3 t2 t12 t77 t33 t42 t56`.\n\nThe grammar has a lot of non-terminals, so it's quite complex. I'll need to see if there's a way to derive the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, which is defined as NT0 -> NT6 NT7. So S becomes NT6 NT7. Each of these non-terminals can be expanded further.\n\nI'll start by writing down the initial expansion:\n\n1. S \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nNext, I need to expand NT6 and NT7. Looking at NT6's productions, I see NT6 can be expanded into NT7 NT9 or other combinations. Similarly, NT7 can be expanded into NT4 NT0 or other terms.\n\nHowever, without writing out all possible expansions, this could get very long. Another approach is to check if the string can be formed by the productions.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t43. Let me see where t43 comes from. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 \u2192 't72', NT0 \u2192 't23', NT5 \u2192 't47', etc. Wait, actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce t's. For example, NT2 \u2192 't7', NT9 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t43, which doesn't directly match any terminal. That's confusing because if the start symbol S produces NT6 NT7, and each of those can only produce a string of terminals or non-terminals, then either the string must consist entirely of terminals (if all non-terminals are expanded into terminals) or include non-terminals if some are not expanded. But in the given string, all tokens are terminals (t followed by numbers like t43, t53, etc.), so I need to check if the entire string can be derived by expanding all non-terminals into these tokens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into parts that each correspond to the productions.\n\nLet me look for patterns in the productions. For example, sometimes NT0 appears in multiple productions; for instance, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, which could lead to terms like t81 and t62, which are present in the string.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a parsing problem: try to parse the string using the grammar. Let's see:\n\nThe string is a list of terminals. Let's start with S \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nSo I need to split the string into parts where NT6 produces a string and NT7 produces another. The combined string should match the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to track possible expansions:\n\nBut given the length of the string and the complexity, this is tedious.\n\nAlternatively, think about the structure of the string. Let me count the number of terms to see if it's possible.\n\nWait, let's list all tokens: it seems like 40 tokens. Since S is S \u2192 NT6 NT7, and each of those can produce multiple terms, maybe the number of terms can vary, but I need to see if the count matches any possible expansion.\n\nWait, but in some productions the non-terminals are expanded into two terms, so the count can vary. For example, each NT0 could produce two terms, leading to more tokens.\n\nBut the string has 40 tokens, so we need to check if the possible expansions can result in exactly 40 tokens.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: see if any production chain can generate the string by looking for substrings that match parts of the grammar.\n\nFor example, the first two tokens are t43 and t53. Let's see if these can come from some production. Looking through the grammar, perhaps NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, but NT4 has several productions, including NT4 \u2192 't32'. Not matching. Or perhaps NT3 \u2192 't53'? Let me check the grammar: yes, NT3 \u2192 't53' and NT3 \u2192 't3', etc. So if the first token is NT3 \u2192 't53', and the second is another NT3 \u2192 't53', that would require the first step to be something that expands into two NT3s, but looking for any production that gives two NT3s.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see that some non-terminals produce 't' directly. For example, NT3 \u2192 't53', so each 't53' comes from NT3.\n\nLooking at the string, there are several instances of 't53' and 't5'. I think I should see if these can be derived from certain productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string can be formed by expanding NT0 in a certain way.\n\nWait, for example, NT0 appears in several productions, like NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. So if I can find a way to expand NT0 into the required parts.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Another approach is to check each part of the string for possible derivations and see if they fit.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let me note that the grammar is a context-free one, so perhaps we can represent it as a pushdown automaton and try to see if the string can be processed without getting stuck. However, without drawing the PDA, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into parts that match specific production rules.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to break it down:\n\nt43 t53 t11 t20 t3 t3 t43 t22 t81 t12 t52 t79 t37 t60 t79 t72 t81 t33 t69 t62 t27 t80 t15 t40 t26 t3 t8 t5 t9 t5 t27 t53 t63 t52 t52 t70 t72 t2 t62 t60 t3 t35 t3 t2 t12 t77 t33 t42 t56\n\nLet me count the tokens: there are 40 terms. So if each expansion of non-terminals into terminals produces two terms, perhaps the initial expansion could produce 40 terms.\n\nWait, for example, each rule is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, so each application of a rule would double the number of symbols. However, since the initial S is one symbol, maybe the expansion could result in 2^n symbols. For n=5, 2^5=32, which is less than 40. For n=6, 64, which is more than 40. So maybe somewhere in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps non-terminals are expanded multiple times, mixing terminal and non-terminal symbols, but in the end, all non-terminals would be fully expanded.\n\nBut the string has all terminals, so all non-terminals must have been fully expanded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be represented as a series of productions of the grammar.\n\nI think the key here is to realize that for any context-free grammar, determining if a string is in the language is equivalent to whether the string can be derived by the grammar in a certain number of steps.\n\nHowever, without a clear algorithm, this seems challenging. But maybe there's a shortcut by seeing if the string can be broken down into parts that fit into the recursive structure of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be grouped into subparts that match specific productions.\n\nWait, I should note that the grammar is quite complex with many non-terminals. Perhaps it's better to look for patterns in the string and see if they correspond to any production.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to look for patterns in the string and see if they can be explained by the grammar.\n\nFor example, the string starts with t43, t53. Now, looking at the grammar, NT3 can produce 't53', so these could be from NT3's production.\n\nLooking further, after t43 and t53, we have t11, t20, etc. So the string is: t43 t53 t11 t20 t3 t3 t43 t22 t81 t1"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar has a bunch of production rules, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the grammar and the string again. The grammar is quite extensive with many non-terminals and productions, but I notice that some of the rules are a bit repetitive or have multiple right-hand sides. The string to evaluate is a series of tokens separated by spaces, which I assume are the terminal symbols the grammar can produce.\n\nSince the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. That means when deriving the string, the parser will use a bottom-up approach, applying the productions until the start symbol S is reached.\n\nMy task is to determine if the string can be derived from S using these productions. To do this, I can approach it by trying to match the string to the grammar's rules or perhaps use a method like CYK parsing, which is efficient for CNF grammars. However, without a full CYK table, maybe I can find a pattern or structure in the string that aligns with the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t80 t15 t61 t15 t57 t83 t63 t33 t5 t76 t77 t56 t63 t54 t43 t17 t73 t39 t31 t51 t5 t73 t39 t17 t54 t56 t24 t54 t37 t12 t28 t84 t28 t64 t20 t43 t72 t27 t39 t60 t67 t33 t27 t54 t12 t12 t17 t72 t84 t10\".\n\nIt's a long string, but maybe I can break it down into smaller chunks that might correspond to parts of the grammar. For example, I notice several occurrences of 't' followed by numbers, which are the terminal symbols. I need to see if these terminals can be generated by the grammar's rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some terminals are directly produced by certain non-terminals. For example, NT2 can produce 't7', NT5 can produce 't47', and so on. It might help to see if the string can be divided into segments where each segment corresponds to a production in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to find the start symbol S in the string. S is defined as NT0 NT4. So somewhere in the string, there should be a sequence that starts with NT0 followed by NT4. Let me scan the string for 't23 t43' since NT0 \u2192 't23' and NT4 \u2192 't37'. But in the string, I see 't23' later on, but not immediately after 't84'. Hmm, maybe looking for larger chunks.\n\nAnother approach is to see if certain subsequences can be produced by the rules. For example, 't80' is produced by NT0 \u2192 't23', and then NT0 can lead to other tokens. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I should consider that each step in the derivation can produce a terminal and possibly non-terminals, but since the string must consist only of terminals, the entire derivation must result in a sequence of terminals without non-terminals left.\n\nI think the key is to check if the string can be split into parts that match the grammar's right-hand sides. For example, the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 means S can produce a string that starts with what NT0 produces, followed by what NT4 produces. NT0 can be 't23' or, through other productions, produce more non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the string is the concatenation of all the terminals derived from S, perhaps I should check if the string can be split according to the grammar's rules, maybe recursively.\n\nFor instance, if a substring corresponds to NT0 followed by NT4, that's a possible step. Or if a part of the string corresponds to a production where NT0 is derived into something, and similarly for NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built by recursively applying the grammar's productions. Let me see if I can find a pattern where certain terminal sequences are allowed.\n\nLooking at the grammar, many non-terminals produce 't' symbols combined with numbers, and some of these 't's are used multiple times, like 't83' and 't61' appearing a few times. This might suggest that certain production paths are taken multiple times, but I'm not sure.\n\nI could try to reconstruct a possible derivation path. Let's start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the string would start with whatever NT0 produces followed by whatever NT4 produces. Let's see if the string starts with a production that starts with NT0, which produces 't23' or further non-terminals.\n\nWait, in the string, the sequence starts with 't80', 't15', 't61', etc. 't80' corresponds to NT0 \u2192 't80', right? Let me check the grammar: NT0 \u2192 't23', 't43', 't54', 't67', etc. Wait, in the grammar, NT0 has several production rules, some of which are to terminals, others to two non-terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. So, NT0 could produce a sequence of terminals if NT6 and NT7 eventually produce them.\n\nBut looking at the start, the string begins with 't80', which from the grammar, looks like there's no production for NT0 that directly results in 't80'. Wait, let me check the grammar again. In the provided rules, I see lines like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT4 NT6, etc. There's also NT0 \u2192't23', 't43', etc., but does it produce 't80'? Looking through the list, I don't see NT0 directly producing 't80'. Hmm, maybe 't80' is a direct production, but perhaps I missed it.\n\nWait, looking through the list, I see lines like \"NT0 -> 't72'\", \"NT0 -> 't67'\", \"NT0 -> 't74'\", etc., but I don't see 't80'. Maybe 't80' is produced by a combination of two non-terminals. For example, NT0 could be split into two parts, each producing a terminal.\n\nWait, so if NT0 can produce, say, NT6 NT7, and each of those could further produce terminals, perhaps the overall string starts with the concatenation of NT6 and NT7's produced terminals.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't80'. Wait, but if NT0 can only produce certain terminals or further non-terminals, maybe 't80' is produced by a secondary production. Or perhaps 't80' is from a different non-terminal.\n\nWait, actually, in the string, 't80' is the first symbol. Let me check the grammar: I see NT0 \u2192 't80' is there. Yes, one of the rules is NT0 -> 't80'. So, the first symbol 't80' is produced directly by NT0. Then, the string must be the combination of what NT0 produces, which is 't80' followed by NT4.\n\nWait, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so S generates a string that starts with whatever NT0 produces, followed by whatever NT4 produces. So in the string, after 't80', the next symbols should be what NT4 produces. Let's look at the string: after 't80' comes 't15', 't61', etc.\n\nSo, the next token is 't15'. Let's see if NT4 produces 't15'. Looking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions. One of them is NT4 \u2192 't37'. Another is NT4 \u2192 't5' and 't32'. Wait, is there a production for NT4 that results in 't15'? Let me check the list.\n\nLooking through the grammer, I see NT4: 't37', 't8', 't5', 't43', 't37' again, and others like 't28', 't73', etc. Hmm, I don't see 't15' being directly produced by NT4. So maybe NT4 is further split into two non-terminals, like NT4 \u2192 something NT something, and each of those eventually produce 't15' and another terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol S can't produce the string because the first token 't80' is from NT0, and NT0 followed by NT4 can't directly lead to the next tokens.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's step back. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string must start with NT0 output followed by NT4 output.

So the string must start with whatever NT0 and NT4 produce.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0 and NT4:\n\nNT0 can go to NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, NT0 NT5, etc., and eventually, terminals like 't23', 't43', etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can go to NT5 NT2, NT8 NT6, etc., leading to terminals like 't28', 't37', etc.\n\nBut it's going to be really time-consuming to trace all possible substitutions for such a long string. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to structure this.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar, trying to match each part as per the productions. However, doing this manually for a string of 78 tokens (split into 78 terms by spaces) is impractical.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for any production rules that directly lead to these terminals and see if they connect in a way that forms the given string.\n\nBut let me see if there's a way to find a derivation by grouping these tokens according to the production rules.\n\nEach rule starts with NT and has two parts, which are other NTs, except for the ones ending with 't'. So each production is either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nThe string has 78 tokens, which is 78 't's with numbers. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation is two non-terminals, which further expand, until the leaves (terminals) are reached.\n\nGiven the length, it's likely that the string is derived starting from S, which produces two NTs, each of which can split into more NTs, but the end result would be a tree where the number of terminals is roughly 2^n for n steps.\n\nHowever, the string is quite long, so perhaps the number of steps is around 6 or 7, leading to 64 or 128 terminals, but 78 is close to that. Wait, but 2^6 is 64, 2^7 is 128, so 78 is in between, which might be possible with some branching.\n\nBut to be honest, manually tracing such a long string is impossible. Maybe I can look for some common patterns or terminals that might help.\n\nLooking at the string: the first term is t74, so the initial NT0 must produce t74. Looking at the productions for NT0, I see NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, etc. There's also NT0 \u2192 't23', 't43', 't74', etc. So t74 is directly possible from NT0.\n\nThen the next term is t26. Looking at NT6, it can directly produce t83, but in the string, we have t26. Looking for NT that can directly produce t26: let me check the productions, looking for a production NT... \u2192 t26.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't26' is one of the options under NT2.\n\nSo t26 is directly produced by NT2.\n\nHow do we get to NT2 from the previous NT0? Wait, the first part is NT0 producing t74, and the second part is NT4. So after NT0, we have NT4, and we need to see what NT4 can produce.\n\nWait, in the starting production: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So after NT0 produces t74, we need NT4 to produce some sequence ending with t26. So let's see what NT4 can do.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: many, but let's see if any lead to t26. Looking through the productions for NT4:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't37', 't5', 't32', etc., but not directly t26. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps NT4 can split into NT5 and NT2. Let's see: NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. So NT5 can produce something that leads to t37, and NT2 can produce t26.\n\nSo let me think: S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nNT0 \u2192 t74 (directly, because NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 't74').\n\nThen NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nNT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6, among others. Hmm, not directly t37. Let me check NT5's productions:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't27', 't33', 't3', etc. Also NT5 can produce NT9 or NT6.\n\nWait, there's NT5 \u2192 't47' (among others). But I'm trying to get to t37.\n\nLooking for a path where NT5 \u2192 something that can produce t37. Checking NT's that can produce t37:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't39' and NT3 \u2192 't39'. So someone needs to produce t37.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions: one is NT3 \u2192 't39', another is NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9, etc. Maybe it's better to think bottom-up.\n\nBut it's getting complicated. Let's try to see how the next part of the string goes: t74 followed by t26.\n\nSo the initial step would be S \u2192 NT0 NT4, producing t74 and something that produces t26.\n\nSo NT4 must produce t26. But NT4 doesn't have a direct production for t26. Wait, wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back, in the productions under NT4, there's a production NT4 \u2192 't28' (perhaps? Let me scan the list).\n\nLooking through:\n\n- Yes, under NT4: 't28' is there. So NT4 can produce 't28' directly.\n\nBut in the string, after t74 comes t26, so that's a problem. Because t26 comes from NT2, but how do we get NT2 from NT4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the production for NT4 splits into NT5 and NT2. So NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nSo then we have:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nNow, NT2. Looking at NT2's productions, one of them is NT2 \u2192 't26'. So yes, that's possible.\n\nSo the part after t74 would be t26, meaning NT2 produces t26, which requires NT2 to directly produce t26. So the production would be:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, where NT2 \u2192 't26'.\n\nSo how does NT5 get into the picture? We need NT5 to produce something else that eventually leads to the rest of the string.\n\nBut we have already used up the NT2 that produces t26. So what's the rest? Let's look at the string:\n\nt74 t26 t69 t40 t28 t56 t40 t39 t12 t81 t26 t44 t2 t53 t74 t51 t32 t79 t9 t53 t20 t37 t11 t72 t54 t43 t57 t35 t57 t26 t73 t52 t57 t83 t5 t23 t83 t21 t44 t51 t13 t5 t79 t31 t11 t21 t67 t40 t83 t7.\n\nSo after the initial t74 and t26, the next tokens are t69, t40, etc.\n\nNow, after NT0 produces t74, and NT4 produces ...

Then, both NT6 and NT7 need to be expanded.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8 (from NT6 -> NT9 NT8). Both NT9 and NT8.\n\nNT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2 (from NT9 -> NT5 NT2). So, NT9 and NT8 need further expansion.\n\nFor NT5: NT5 can go to NT5 NT6, NT7 NT3, NT9 NT6, or NT7 NT3. Wait, let's check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar might have multiple rules for some non-terminals. Let me list all the rules for each non-terminal to see possible transitions. But this could get complex quickly. Alternatively, maybe a better approach is to consider the terminals and see if they can be directly replaced.\n\nThe target string is \"t35 t9\". So, the first terminal is t35, and the second is t9. Let's look at how these terminals are derived.\n\nFrom the given rules, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. Let's note all the rules where a non-terminal directly maps to a terminal.\n\nFor example, looking through the rules:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7' (from NT2 -> 't7')\nNT3 \u2192 't53' (from NT3 -> 't53')\nNT5 \u2192 't47' (from NT5 -> 't47')\nNT7 \u2192 't13' (from NT7 -> 't13')\nNT0 \u2192 't23' (from NT0 -> 't23')\nNT4 \u2192 't32' (from NT4 -> 't32')\nNT8 \u2192 't21' (from NT8 -> 't21')\nNT9 \u2192 't60' (from NT9 -> 't60')\nAnd so on for other rules.\n\nWait, so the string is \"t35 t9\". So, first, t35 is a terminal. Looking through the rules, is there any NT that directly produces t35? Scanning the rules:\n\nLooking at the rules again, I don't see any direct production for NT0, NT4, etc. to t35. So maybe it's produced by a derived terminal through the grammar, but perhaps it's a dead end because the given rules don't have t35 as a terminal. So t35 cannot be derived unless it's on the left side of a production that eventually produces a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if any of the NT rules derive to t35. Let me go through each non-terminal and see if any of their rules produce t35.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT0\u2192t23\nNT2\u2192t7\nNT3\u2192t53\nNT4\u2192t32\nNT5\u2192t47\nNT6\u2192t83\nNT7\u2192t13\nNT8\u2192t21\nNT9\u2192t60\n\nSo none of these directly produce t35. So t35 must come from a non-terminal that doesn't directly produce it. Wait, so maybe t35 is derived from some other NT that eventually, through a chain of productions, ends up with t35. But in the given rules, I don't see any such production. So unless t35 is a terminal in some other way, it can't be derived.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the string is \"t35 t9\", but perhaps the grammar allows t35 to be a terminal. Let me check all rules again.\n\nLooking at all the rules, none of them have a non-terminal directly producing t35 except perhaps a rule I missed. Let me go through all the rules again to be sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some rules. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT0: it has several rules, but none ending with t35.\n\nLooking through, maybe some rule chain could produce t35. For example, if a non-terminal A produces NTx NTy, and NTx produces a terminal, and NTy produces another terminal, but none of the direct rules produce t35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is split into t35 and t9, which are terminals, so both need to be produced by some NTs in the derivation.\n\nWait, but if the grammar doesn't have any NT that directly produces t35, then t35 cannot be a terminal. Therefore, the string \"t35 t9\" can't be generated because neither NT0 nor any other NT directly produce t35 or t9. Wait, but t9 can be produced by NT9 \u2192 t60 NT3? No, wait, no\u2014NT9 \u2192 t60 (from NT9 \u2192 't60').\n\nWait, looking at the rules:\n\nNT9 \u2192 't60' (from NT9 \u2192 't60')\n\nBut the string has t9, which is a terminal. So does any NT derive directly to 't9'? Looking at the rules, the only 't9' is from NT9 \u2192 't60', but that's not 't9'. So t9 is not directly produced. So 't9' can't be a terminal since there's no rule where a non-terminal directly produces t9.\n\nSimilarly, for t35, again, no NT directly produces it. So the conclusion is that neither 't35' nor 't9' are terminals in the grammar because none of the rules have a non-terminal producing them. Therefore, the string \"t35 t9\" cannot be generated by this grammar because the terminals don't exist in the grammar.\n\nWait, but I might have missed some rules. Let me check all the rules again to make sure I didn't miss any that could produce t35 or t9.\n\nLooking through each rule's right-hand side, the symbols are mostly non-terminals except when it's a terminal like 't14', 't43', etc., but I don't see 't35' or 't9' as any terminal. So it's safe to say that these are not terminals in the grammar. Therefore, they can't be part of the derived string.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-34","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string \"t28 t7 t72\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the grammar structure. CKNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t28, then t7, then t72. Each of these seems to be terminal symbols, so I need to see if each of them can be derived from the right non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, every production either splits into two non-terminals or is a terminal. So each 't' must be produced directly or via a chain of productions.\n\nLet's break down each terminal in the string:\n\n1. t28: Looking at the productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't28' because in the grammar, there's a rule: NT0 -> 't28'. So t28 can be directly produced by NT0. Good.\n\n2. t7: Let's check if there's a NT that can produce 't7'. Looking through the rules, I see NT2 \u2192 't7' because in the grammar, NT2 -> 't7' is a production. So t7 can be produced by NT2.\n\n3. t72: Looking at the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't72' because there's a rule: NT3 -> 't72'. So t72 comes from NT3.\n\nNow, the string is NT0 NT2 NT3, because each terminal is produced by a respective non-terminal.\n\nThe start symbol S produces NT0 NT4. So after S, the next step is to derive NT0 and NT4. But our string after the first t28 is t7 and t72, which corresponds to NT2 and NT3. So how can NT4 derive into NT2 and NT3?\n\nLooking deeper, let's check if NT4 can produce a string that includes NT2 and NT3 through the productions.\n\nLooking for NT4, I see that in the grammar, NT4 has several productions. For example, one of them is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Another is NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3. Also, NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7 and others, but I'm not sure if that's the way.\n\nBut our string after S is NT0 and NT4. So if NT0 can produce certain things, let's see:\n\nNT0 has rules like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, and so on. It seems that NT0 might eventually derive into sequences involving more non-terminals, but the key point is that after S \u2192 NT0 NT4, we need to see if NT0 can derive into a string that leads to t28, and NT4 can derive into t7 and t72.\n\nWait, but the string is \"t28 t7 t72\", which would correspond to NT0 producing t28, NT4 producing t7 t72. Hmm, but how can NT4 produce t7 and t72?\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, one is NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6. Another is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. There's also NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3, which is recursion, but I'm not sure if that's helpful here.\n\nLet me consider if NT4 can produce anything ending with t7 and t72. Wait, perhaps I need to find a way for NT4 to derive into a string that includes both t7 and t72.\n\nAnother approach is to reconstruct the parse tree. Starting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then NT0 must derive into t28, which it can do directly. So that's satisfied.\n\nBut then NT4 needs to derive into t7 t72. So let's see if NT4 can produce a string that starts with t7 and includes t72. Let's look at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. So if NT5 can produce t7 and NT2 can produce t72, that might work. Check NT5's productions: Yes, there's NT5 \u2192 't74', but that's just a terminal. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nLooking through the grammar, NT5 has several rules. One is NT5 \u2192 NT15, which seems non-terminal. Another is NT5 \u2192 't43', which is a terminal. So if NT5 can produce 't43', but I need it to produce t7 and t72. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe NT5 can produce t7? Let me look. I see NT4 \u2192 NT19 (wait, looking at the grammar: actually, I'm given a list of productions, but I need to scan each one.\n\nWait, the user provided a list of grammar rules.

{"custom_id":"request-39","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if the string \"t23 t81 t76\" can be generated by a given context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar provided. It seems pretty complex with a lot of non-terminals and production rules. Each non-terminal can expand into other non-terminals until they eventually produce terminal symbols, which are strings like 't23', 't81', etc.\n\nThe string I need to check is \"t23 t81 t76\". Since this is a sequence of four symbols separated by spaces, I can ignore the spaces for now. So the main concern is whether the concatenation of these three terminal symbols can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions of the grammar.\n\nStarting with S, which according to the first production rule S -> NT0 NT4, so it's a combination of two non-terminals: NT0 and NT4. To get the string, both NT0 and NT4 must translate into sequences that can produce \"t23\", \"t81\", and \"t76\" respectively.\n\nLooking at the production for NT0: It has multiple rules, some of which lead to terminals. Here, I notice a few terminals: NT0 -> 't23', which seems like a direct production. Also, NT0 can produce 't43', which is another terminal symbol, and similarly for NT4, like 't37'.\n\nWait, the string is \"t23 t81 t76\". So let me check if these can be derived directly or through longer chains.\n\nStarting with NT0, which can directly produce 't23' as per rule NT0 -> 't23'. So if NT0 is expanding to 't23', that handles the first part of the string.\n\nThen, NT4 can produce 't37' as per NT4 -> 't37'. But the second part of the string is 't81'. Hmm, so perhaps I need to look deeper into NT4's possible expansions.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, I see NT4 -> 't81' in one rule (NT4 -> 't81'). So yes, NT4 can produce directly 't81' as well. So now, NT0 is 't23' and NT4 is 't81', and we have 't76' left.\n\nWait, the string is \"t23 t81 t76\", so that would require NT0 to produce 't23', NT4 to produce 't81', and then somewhere else a production that includes 't76'. But in S, it's NT0 and NT4 at the top level. So that would be \"t23 t81\" as the first two parts. But then where does 't76' come in?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is three terminal symbols, so the overall string is S => NT0 NT4, and each NT0 and NT4 should produce sequences that when combined become the three parts. But wait, NT0 and NT4 produce one terminal each because, for example, NT0 can be 't23' or 't43' or others. But in the string, we have three terminals, which would require more non-terminals than this. So perhaps the NT0 or NT4 must themselves expand into more symbols that include 't76'.\n\nWait, perhaps S is actually S -> NT0 NT4, and each of NT0 and NT4 can produce multiple symbols, but the total number of symbols in the string is three, so maybe one of them is producing two symbols while the other is producing one.\n\nLet me check the productions again.\n\nNT0 has a production: NT0 -> 't23'. So this is a terminal symbol. Also, there's NT0 -> 't43', etc., but perhaps I should consider if any non-terminals can produce more than one symbol.\n\nWait, another approach: the string is three symbols, so the two non-terminals NT0 and NT4 must each produce one symbol each, and that would require only two symbols, but we have three. That's a problem. Therefore, perhaps one of NT0 or NT4 expands into two symbols, including 't76' as the third symbol.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach: perhaps each non-terminal is expanding into a sequence that includes multiple symbols, and when combined, the total is three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT0 can produce a sequence that includes more than one symbol, and similarly for NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: some of them produce two non-terminals, which then produce more symbols. For example, NT0 -> NT6 NT7, and then each of those can produce more until they hit a terminal.\n\nWait, so perhaps NT0 can expand into a longer sequence. Let's see:\n\nTake NT0 -> NT6 NT7. So let's explore what NT6 and NT7 produce.\n\nNT6 has multiple productions, some of which produce terminals. For example, NT6 -> 't83', 't67', etc.\n\nLooking at NT7: it can produce 't14', 't43', etc. For instance, NT7 -> 't13', so it can produce 't13' directly.\n\nWait, let's see if there's a way for NT0 to produce 't23', NT4 to produce 't81', and then another production that includes 't76' as part of NT0's expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT4 is producing 't81' and then NT0 is producing a sequence that includes 't76' along with 't23' and another symbol.\n\nWait, no, the string is 't23 t81 t76' exactly. It's three symbols, so maybe the S production leads to NT0 and NT4, each of which can produce more than one symbol, but somehow combining to three.\n\nWait, perhaps NT0 and NT4 are each producing a string of two symbols each, but in the context of the top-level production S -> NT0 NT4, the total would be four symbols, which is more than our string. But we have three, so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps I've got the structure wrong. Maybe each NT0 and NT4 can produce multiple symbols, and when combined, they exactly produce the three symbols in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of NT0 or NT4 produces a single symbol, and the other produces two symbols, but that would still add up to three.\n\nWait, let me try to see if that's possible.\n\nFor instance, let's say NT0 produces 't23', a single symbol. Then NT4 would need to produce a string that includes two symbols, like 't81 t76', but NT4's productions are all single symbols, so perhaps this isn't possible. Because NT4 can only produce one terminal per production.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Because according to the grammar, NT4 can produce a single terminal at a time. So NT4 is an NT, which can produce a single terminal or perhaps non-terminals that can expand further.\n\nWait, let me correct myself: the non-terminals can produce other non-terminals, but ultimately, all paths from non-terminals to terminals must terminate. So perhaps NT4 can only produce one terminal symbol, as all productions from NT4 seem to either produce a single terminal or other non-terminals that eventually produce terminals. So if NT4's production is such that it can expand into multiple symbols, but in our case, the string requires three symbols, which is three terminals.\n\nWait, but if S is NT0 NT4, each NT can expand into one or more symbols, and the combined expansion from S would be two sequences. For example, NT0 could expand into a string of two symbols, and NT4 into one, making three total. Or NT0 into one symbol and NT4 into two. So maybe that's possible.\n\nWait, let's examine NT0's productions. One of them is NT0 -> NT6 NT7. So when expanded, that could produce two symbols. Let's see where NT6 and NT7 lead.\n\nFrom NT6, some productions produce terminals like 't83', while others produce non-terminals. For example, NT6 -> NT7 NT9, and NT7 could be a non-terminal that eventually produces a terminal. Similarly, NT6 can also go to 't83', which is a terminal.\n\nSimilarly, NT7 can produce 't43' directly, which is a terminal.\n\nSo perhaps NT0 can expand into two symbols: one from NT6 and one from NT7. Let me see:\n\nIf NT0 -> NT6 NT7, then each of NT6 and NT7 must expand into terminals. Suppose NT6 can produce 't83' and NT7 can produce 't43', then NT0 would produce 't83 t43', which is two symbols. Similarly, NT4 might produce one terminal, say 't81', making the total string 't83 t43 t81', which is three symbols, but that's not the string we need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT6 can produce 't23' and NT7 can produce 't76', then NT0 would expand into"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-57","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by a context-free grammar. The string is `t67 t32 t12 t32`, and the grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think carefully about how to approach it.\n\nFirst, I recall that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are terminals or non-terminals, and B and C are not both terminals. Also, the start symbol is on the left, and the right side has exactly two symbols. Since this grammar is already in CNF, that's a good start.\n\nNow, the string given is a sequence of terminals: `t67 t32 t12 t32`. So each of these must be derived starting from some non-terminal. My goal is to parse this string from left to right, using the productions to see if it can be formed step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each non-terminal's productions are listed. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. But the given string starts with t67, so I need to find which non-terminals can produce t67. Scanning through the productions, I see that NT6 can produce t67: NT6 \u2192 t83 and t67? Wait, no, looking again, I see NT6 \u2192 t83 when it's in another production, but for t67, looking back, maybe I got it wrong.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, there's a production where NT6 \u2192 t83, but that's not t67. I think I need to check each production carefully. Let me search for 't67' in the productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 t56\n- NT7 \u2192 t43\n- NT5 \u2192 t39\n- NT6 \u2192 t83\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t33\n- NT4 \u2192 t37\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT3 \u2192 t31\n- NT8 \u2192 t21\n- NT6 \u2192 t77\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should list all the places where terminals appear and see which are directly connected.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to reverse-engineer the parse. The string is four tokens, so the grammar must generate it in four steps. Each step would involve expanding a non-terminal into two other non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see if the string can be split according to the grammar's leftmost derivations. Let me think about the structure of the grammar. Each production is always two non-terminals on the right, so the leftmost derivation would split the string accordingly.\n\nThe string is t67 t32 t12 t32. Since each production has two symbols on the right, the derivation must split the string into pairs. So maybe first combine t67 t32 as one unit, then t12 t32 as another, but wait, four tokens would split into two pairs, each pair being a production.\n\nBut wait, each production is non-terminal \u2192 non-terminal non-terminal. So to get four tokens, I think the derivation would need to have a structure like A B C D, which would be built by the first step being a production leading to two parts, each of which then produces the rest.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to check if the sequence can be formed by a series of productions. Let's consider the starting symbol S, which produces NT0 NT4. So the first two tokens must be NT0 and NT4, but the string starts with t67, which is a terminal. So S must derive a sequence starting with t67, so perhaps NT0 or NT6 must produce it.\n\nWait, looking back: NT6 \u2192 t83 in one production, but in another production, NT6 \u2192 t67? Let me check: yes, I think I missed that earlier. Under NT6: \"NT6 -> NT9 NT8\" and \"NT6 -> NT7 NT9\". Hmm, not directly. Wait, another production: looking back, maybe I'm misreading.\n\nWait, in the grammar, under NT6, I see \"NT6 -> NT7 NT9\", but \"NT6 -> t67\" isn't listed. Alternatively, perhaps in another rule. Wait, looking through, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t83 in one case, but no 't67' directly.\n\nWait, actually, let me find all the terminals. Looking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- t67 comes from NT6 \u2192 t83 when? No, 't67' appears in the rules as a result of some productions. Wait, maybe I should see how each terminal is produced.\n\nLooking through all the production rules where a non-terminal is on the left, but the right side is a terminal:\n\nLooking for any rule where, for example, NTx \u2192 something that results in a terminal. I see:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t13 (no, perhaps I'm mixing up): Let me look again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should list all the productions that produce terminals directly.\n\nI see:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4: not terminal.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2: no.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0: no.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, some rules have a terminal on the right side. For example:\n\nWait, looking through the rules, some like:\n\n- NT6 -> t83: Not relevant.\n\nWait, perhaps I've missed a terminal in a production. Let me go through each production step by step.\n\nLooking at each production:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4: no terminal.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2: no.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT2: no.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT5 NT2: no.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8: no.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT8 NT6: no.\n\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9: no.\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9: no.\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0: no.\n\nWait, I think I've missed some. Let me check every line:\n\nLooking through all 64 rules (assuming, but maybe too many). Maybe a better approach is to see how the string's tokens are used.\n\nThe string is t67 t32 t12 t32.\n\nSo first step: find which non-terminal produces t67. Looking at productions, I don't see any direct production for t67. Wait, is there a production where a non-terminal is followed by a terminal which is part of the string?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's recount. Each production is A \u2192 BC. So to get a terminal, one of B or C must be a terminal, and the other a non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking again, perhaps I have to find any production where the non-terminals on the right side, when combined during derivation, produce the required tokens. Alternatively, maybe the string can be split into two parts, each part being the result of a production.\n\nWait, four tokens, so perhaps it's the result of two productions, each generating two tokens. Let me consider that.\n\nFirst, the string is t67 t32 t12 t32. So perhaps t67 t32 is derived from a production, and t12 t32 is derived from another.\n\nSo first, t67 t32 could come from NTx \u2192 t67 t32, which would require NTx has production to t67 and t32. But none of the rules have both t67 and t32 directly.\n\nAlternatively, each pair of tokens is a production. So the first token t67 must come from a production's first symbol, and the second t32 from the second.\n\nBut none of the non-terminals directly produce t67 and t32 as a pair.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token t67 is from NT6 \u2192 t83, but that's not t67. Alternatively, maybe it's derived from another production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try starting from the string and see where it can come from in the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production is A \u2192 B C, where B can be a terminal or a non-terminal, and same for C. So for the string to be generated, there must exist a way to split it such that the entire string can be split into pairs that are productions.\n\nBut each step in the derivation must consist of expanding non-terminals to two non-terminals, but in the end, they must all produce the required string.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to construct an S-derivation.\n\nBut wait, the string has four tokens, so maybe it's generated by S expanding into NT0 NT4, then each of those non-terminals expand further, etc.\n\nBut in the given string, the first token is t67, which would require that one of the non-terminals like NT0 or NT4 can produce t67 when combined with another non-terminal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the derivation could start with NT0 NT4 \u2192 something, but the first token is t67, so perhaps NT0 produces t67 in"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-56","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out if the string \"t53 t61 t43 t5\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky normal form (CNF) grammars have specific rules: each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, the grammar provided should follow these rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see a bunch of production rules. Each rule seems to be in CNF because they all have exactly two non-terminals on the right or just one terminal. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is in CNF. So, that's good.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate is \"t53 t61 t43 t5\". It looks like this is a sequence of terminals, each corresponding to a specific non-terminal in the grammar. Each \"t\" seems to represent a production.\n\nNow, I need to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions. The start symbol is S.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the string starts with \"t53\". I need to see if \"t53\" corresponds to any production starting a derivation.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals have productions ending with \"t53\". For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't27'\n- NT7 \u2192 't54'\n- NT4 \u2192 't42'\n\nWait, \"t53\" is specifically for NT3. So, to get \"t53\", we must have a production where NT3 is used.\n\nSo, the first symbol \"t53\" can be derived from NT3. That means in the first production, we need NT3 on the left side.\n\nNow, looking at NT3's productions, one of them is NT3 \u2192 't53', which directly gives us \"t53\". But since the string has \"t53\" as the first symbol, we can't have any non-terminals after it in that position. So, perhaps the derivation starts with NT3 \u2192 't53', and the rest of the string must be handled from there.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in context-free grammars, the entire string must be derived from the start symbol by a series of productions. So, each symbol in the output string represents a production from a non-terminal to a terminal.\n\nSo, each \"t\" in the string corresponds to a production where a non-terminal is replaced by that terminal.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Each symbol could come from a production that may produce a string of terminals. For example, a rule like A \u2192 BC, where B might produce a terminal followed by C producing another.\n\nBut in this case, the string seems to consist of four terminals: \"t53\", \"t61\", \"t43\", \"t5\".\n\nSo, perhaps each symbol is directly from a non-terminal that produces that terminal in one step.\n\nLet me check the productions for each \"t\":\n\n- \"t53\": Look for production rules where the right-hand side leads to \"t53\". From the grammar, NT3 \u2192 't53' is a direct production. So, that symbol can come from NT3.\n\n- \"t61\": Similarly, looking through the grammar, I see NT6 \u2192 't61' as a production. So, \"t61\" can come from NT6.\n\n- \"t43\": Checking the rules, I see NT4 \u2192 't43'. So, \"t43\" comes from NT4.\n\n- \"t5\": From the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't5' is a direct production.\n\nSo, the string \"t53 t61 t43 t5\" would correspond to the sequence of non-terminals: NT3, NT6, NT4, NT5.\n\nNow, I need to see if the start symbol S can derive this string through a series of productions leading from S to NT3, then NT3 to something else, and so on until we get to the terminals.\n\nWait, no. Since each symbol in the string is a terminal, each must come directly from a production where that non-terminal is replaced by that terminal. So, the derivation path would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 (from S's rule)\n\nFrom there, each of NT0 and NT4 must produce the corresponding symbols in the string.\n\nBut let's see:\n\n1. The first symbol is \"t53\", which comes from NT3, so in the first production, NT0 must produce \"t53\". But wait, NT0's productions start with NT6 NT7, etc. So, NT0 can't directly produce \"t53\" because all its productions involve other non-terminals.\n\nWait, that complicates things. Because if the first symbol is \"t53\", which requires NT3, but S's production starts with NT0 NT4, which can't directly produce \"t53\", maybe the string isn't derived from S. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood how the production rules work.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misapplied the rules. Let me think again.\n\nThe string is \"t53 t61 t43 t5\". Each of these terminals corresponds to a terminal produced by a specific non-terminal. So, the first symbol \"t53\" must come from NT3, the second \"t61\" from NT6, the third \"t43\" from NT4, and the fourth \"t5\" from NT5.\n\nBut to get that, the production chain from S must produce these in sequence. So, perhaps S can produce NT3 followed by something else? But S's first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, after S, we have NT0 and NT4. So, the first two symbols would be the products of NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nWait, so perhaps the first two symbols must be the products of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is \"t53\", which is NT3. But according to the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4, after S, we have NT0 and NT4. So, the first symbol should come from NT0, not NT3. So, perhaps there's a conflict here.\n\nLet me map the entire string to the grammar's non-terminals:\n\n1. \"t53\" \u2192 NT3\n2. \"t61\" \u2192 NT6\n3. \"t43\" \u2192 NT4\n4. \"t5\" \u2192 NT5\n\nSo, for S \u2192 NT0 NT4, that means after expanding, the production would start with the expansion of NT0 followed by the expansion of NT4.\n\nSo, the first terminal \"t53\" must be from NT0, and the second \"t61\" from NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-75","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with determining whether the string \"t80 t76 t11 t54 t5\" is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal symbol. That means each production generates exactly one non-terminal or one terminal, and each non-terminal has exactly two productions, both of which are terminals or non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So to start generating the string, we'll need to expand S into NT0 and NT4, then each of those can be expanded further until we get to terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is \"t80 t76 t11 t54 t5\". Each word is a terminal symbol, so we'll need to see if the non-terminals can be expanded into these. Let me map out the rules for the non-terminals involved.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So we need to expand NT0 and NT4 into the correct terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0, the rules are:\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT6\nNT0 -> NT7 NT6\n\nSo from NT0, it can be any of these combinations. I'll need to see which combination can lead to the required terminals.\n\nWait, but each expansion from a non-terminal should be exactly two, right? So let's consider the possible expansions step by step.\n\nLet's first consider NT0. To get a terminal, maybe NT0 has a production that directly starts with a terminal, but looking at the rules for NT0, all its productions are combinations of other NTs, so I need to expand further.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has rules:\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT8 -> NT5 NT3\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nAnd so on. But these are all non-terminals, so we'll have to expand them further.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a path from NT0 and NT4 to the terminals in the string. Since the string has five terminals, I'll need to expand S into NT0 NT4, each producing two non-terminals, leading to a total of four non-terminals, and then further expanding until we get five terminals. Hmm, but the string has five words, so maybe the initial expansion leads to four, and each of those need to produce more.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to see if each terminal in the string can be generated by some NT, and then chain the productions back to form a derivation.\n\nLet's list the terminals in the string: t80, t76, t11, t54, t5. Each must be the result of a NT \u2192 terminal or via a chain.\n\nLooking at the terminal productions, for example, NT8 has a production NT8 -> 't5', and NT5 has 't3', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, looking at the NT rules, each rule ends with a terminal, except the ones with NTs, which are the main ones.\n\nLet me list all the possible NTs and their terminal end productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, the NTs that directly produce terminals are:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't72', 't39', 't10', 't31', 't33', 't53', 't51', 't54', 't60', 't69', 't70', 't72', 't76', 't77', 't79', 't80', 't84', etc.\n- NT4 -> 't37', 't32', 't8', 't28', 't9', 't5', 't9', 't7', etc.\n- NT5 -> 't47', 't15', 't62', 't3', 't7', 't70', 't76', 't70', 't53', 't8', 't70', 't7', etc.\n- NT6 -> 't83', 't62', 't43', 't9', 't70', 't5', 't67', 't43', 't77', 't61', 't8', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't56', 't43', 't43', 't70', 't76', 't57', 't76', etc.\n- NT9 -> 't60', 't74', 't43', 't70', 't84', 't53', 't67', etc.\n\nSo each NT can produce certain terminals. Now, let me see the string: \"t80 t76 t11 t54 t5\".\n\nWait, I don't see t11 in the NT terminals listed above. Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check the NT8 rule: NT8 can produce 't5' if it has a rule like NT8 \u2192 't5' NT. Looking back, yes, NT8 has:\n\nNT8 -> NT5 NT3\nNT8 -> NT6 NT0\nNT8 -> NT8 NT7\nNT8 -> NT8 NT6\nNT8 -> NT6 NT0\nWait, no, the specific terminal productions for NT8 seem to be only NT8 -> 't5'? Or maybe I'm mislooking.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't37' is one production. Let me check all the terminal productions:\n\n- NT8 has 't5' as a production: NT8 -> 't5'\n\nAdditionally, looking at NT4: NT4 -> 't5' and other combinations.\n\nWait, in the list, the grammar's production rules include:\n\nNT5 -> 't3' (from NT5-> 't3'),\nNT4 -> 't32' (from NT4-> 't32'),\nNT7 -> 't57' (from NT7-> 't57'),\nNT8 -> 't5' (from NT8-> 't5'),\nNT0 -> 't23',\nNT2 -> 't7',\nNT3 -> 't72', etc.\n\nSo, all these terminals are produced by specific NTs.\n\nBut wait, the string has t11. But looking through the NTs, none of them directly produce t11. Hmm, that's a problem because if the string has t11, but none of the NTs produce t11, then it's impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.\n\nLet me check all the NT rules to see if any of them can produce 't11':\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I don't see any production where an NT directly becomes 't11'. The closest is NT8 producing 't5', or NT4 producing 't5' or 't9', but nothing gives 't11'.\n\nTherefore, the presence of 't11' in the string makes it impossible for the string to be generated by this grammar.

Let me walk through the process step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, and a is a terminal symbol. This form is useful for certain parsing methods and for analyzing the structure of the strings generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that all the rules are either of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz or NTx \u2192 'tY'. So yes, it follows CNF since each rule is either generating a single terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t44 t9 t43 t53 t70`. Since it's a series of terminals, I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S using the productions of the grammar.\n\nI start by considering the start symbol S. The first rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the string must start by generating NT0 and NT4. Therefore, the first two symbols of the string must be the terminals generated by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two terms are `t44` and `t9`. So, I check how NT0 and NT4 can produce these.\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- NT0 has several productions. One of them is NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Another is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT3, and so on.

Alternatively, perhaps it's in another NT symbol.\n\nWait, in the given list, I see a production like NT0 -> 't43', but I'm not sure which one.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, the NT0 rules do not have a direct production to 't44'. So where does 't44' come from?\n\nWait, perhaps 't44' is produced by another non-terminal. Let me check the string again.\n\nThe string is `t44 t9 t43 t53 t70`.\n\nSo the first symbol is t44.

{"custom_id":"request-93","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t35 t56 t5 t5 t11 t40`. \n\nOkay, first things first, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and 'a' is a terminal symbol. That means every production either produces two non-terminals or a single terminal. So the grammar here is in CNF, which should make things a bit easier.\n\nThe string we're looking at has six tokens: t35, t56, t5, t5, t11, t40. All of these are terminal symbols except possibly some non-terminals, but in the grammar provided, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So each token in the string should correspond to a terminal derived from the grammar.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I need to see if there's a way to derive it using the given rules. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation will correspond to a parse tree where each node is a production, and the leaves are the terminals.\n\nI think the approach should be to start from the start symbol and see if I can break down the string into the possible sequences of productions.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at S's productions: The first one is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Wait, but in the given grammar, S is written as S -> NT0 NT4, which is S -> NT0 NT4. But in the grammar provided, it's written as S -> NT0 NT4. I should check that.\n\nBut wait, looking at the problem, the string starts with t35 t56 t5 t5 t11 t40. Let me see what each of these could correspond to. Maybe I should list all the possible production rules and their terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT0 can produce several things, one of which is 't23' and 't80', etc.\n- NT4 can produce things like 't37', 't5', 't84', 't9', 't28', 't7', 't13', etc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar.\n\nEach symbol in the string must be matched by the grammar. So starting from the beginning, t35 is the first symbol. I need to see if t35 can be derived from any production.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that NT3 can produce 't72', and several others have rules leading to t35? Wait, let me check.\n\nLooking down the list, I don't see any production for NT3 leading directly to t35. Checking each production rule:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan through the rules.\n\nAh, here's a line: NT7 -> 't54'; NT4 -> 't32'; NT3 -> 't53'; NT3 -> 't31'; NT5 -> 't10'; NT0 -> 't43'; NT5 -> 't3'; NT4 -> 't32'; NT7 -> 't43'; NT4 -> 't8'; NT3 -> 't53'; NT3 -> 't31'; NT5 -> 't10'; NT0 -> 't43'; NT2 -> 't7'; NT9 -> 't60'; NT8 -> 't21'; NT4 -> 't84'; NT8 -> 't81'; NT0 -> 't28'; NT4 -> 't7'; NT4 -> 't27'; NT0 -> 't62'; NT2 -> 't26'; NT3 -> 't24'; NT9 -> 't44'; NT5 -> 't15'; NT7 -> 't33'; NT8 -> 't64'; NT6 -> 't77'; NT6 -> 't43'; NT8 -> 't56'; NT3 -> 't2'; NT8 -> 't73'; NT7 -> 't76'; NT6 -> 't61'; NT2 -> 't53'; NT3 -> 't69'; NT4 -> 't70'; NT0 -> 't12'; NT9 -> 't20'; NT7 -> 't57'; NT7 -> 't7'; NT8 -> 't57'; NT2 -> 't63'; NT9 -> 't79'; NT8 -> 't53'; NT8 -> 't22'; NT6 -> 't8'; NT0 -> 't80'; NT4 -> 't51'; NT4 -> 't13'; NT5 -> 't62'; NT3 -> 't8'; NT7 -> 't17'; NT4 -> 't28'; NT0 -> 't40'; NT3 -> 't39'; NT3 -> 't10'; NT0 -> 't52'; NT7 -> 't70'; NT6 -> 't11'; NT0 -> 't35'; NT6 -> 't67'; NT8 -> 't77'; NT4 -> 't42'.\n\nWait, looking at this, I see NT3 has some terminal rules, like NT3 -> 't72'; 't53' via several rules; 't2', 't31', 't39'; 't5'; so t5 could be NT3. So in the string, the second token is t56. Let's see if t56 can come from any production.\n\nLooking through the rules, NT6 can produce 't56' because I see NT6 -> 't83'; wait, but t56 isn't there. Wait, looking again, I don't see a direct production for t56. Or maybe I missed it. Let me scan each line:\n\nLooking through each NT, for example, does any NT have a production that leads to t56? Looking through:\n\n- NT6 -> 't77'; 't43'; 't56' (Wait, yes, I see a line: NT8 -> 't56'. So NT8 produces 't56' directly. So t56 is from NT8. But wait, the string has t56 as the second symbol, so the derivation must go through NT8. But wait, how?\n\nWait, the string is t35 t56 t5 t5 t11 t40. So starting with t35, which is the first symbol. So which NT can produce t35? Let me check each rule for NTs.\n\nLooking through the rules, does any NT produce 't35'? Scanning down, for example, NT3 can produce 't53', 't31', etc., but not t35. Hmm. Let me check each line:\n\nLooking through all the lines, the only place I see t35 is as a production of NT0: NT0 -> 't35' and other rules. So t35 must come directly from NT0. So the first symbol t35 is produced by NT0.\n\nSo now, the first production is NT0. Then, looking at the string, after t35 comes t56. So the next token is t56, which must come from the next production from NT0. NT0's production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. From the grammar, NT0 has several productions, one of which is 't35', but also could be other non-terminals. Wait, no, looking back, in the grammar, the productions for NT0 are:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT0 NT8\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5 \u2014 wait, duplicate? Or maybe I saw a line where it's written as NT0 -> NT5 NT5.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar provided is:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT8\n\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\n\nNT0 -> NT2 NT8\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, I see:\n\nLine: NT0 -> NT9 NT8\n\nLine: NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nSo NT0 can produce two non-terminals in various combinations. So from NT0, depending on the production chosen, the next parts can be other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nSo to get t35, NT0 must directly produce t35, which is allowed because NT0 can produce 't35' directly as one of its rules? Wait, looking back, in the grammar, the rules for NT0 are:\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nWait, in the initial grammar, I think I saw:\n\nNT0 -> 't35' as a production, or maybe it's a production from another symbol. Let me check the whole list of rules again to see which NT can produce t35.\n\nLooking at the grammar lines, I see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-97","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given string \"t27 t24 t53 t14 t33 t27\" can be generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule starts with a non-terminal and has two non-terminals or terminals on the right side. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar rules to see how the symbols like 't24' are derived. I notice that some of the symbols are terminals, like 't14', and others are non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals through a series of steps.\n\nThe string we're checking has 't24', which appears only once. Let me check which rule directly produces 't24'. Looking through the grammar, I see that one of the rules is NT3 -> 't24'. So, NT3 must derive to 't24'. \n\nLooking at the rules for NT3, I see that it can produce 't24', but also has a rule that branches into NT5 and NT9. That's a bit complicated, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, looking back at the string, the next token is 't53'. I check the grammar again and find that NT3 also produces 't53'. So, after 't24' comes 't53', which can also be from NT3. But wait, in the string, 't24' is followed by 't53', but in the grammar, NT3 is a single non-terminal that can go to either 't24' or 't53'. So, I need to see if there's a way to have the entire string generated by starting with S and applying the rules step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't27', which comes from NT3 via NT3 -> 't27'. So, that's the first symbol. Next, 't24' comes from another NT3, but since the first NT3 has already been used, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the NT3 in the first position is different. Wait, no\u2014it's the same NT3 being used, so once it's derived into a terminal, it can't generate another non-terminal immediately after.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to have the string broken down into parts generated by different paths. Let me think about possible derivations.\n\nThe string is t27 t24 t53 t14 t33 t27. Each 't' is a terminal, each number being a specific terminal. Let's list the terminals in order: 27,24,53,14,33,27.\n\nI need to see if each of these can be derived from the grammar in sequence.\n\nStarting with the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So, S must generate two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, but the string only has six symbols. Let me consider how S can break down. Each step in the grammar doubles the number of symbols because each production is two non-terminals. So, the length of the string should be a power of two times the initial length, but since the initial is S producing two, perhaps the string must have a length that's compatible. Let's check: the input string has 6 symbols, which is not a power of two. Hmm, that might be a problem because each production step in CNF doesn't increase the length by much. Wait, no\u2014the initial string from S would only have two symbols, then each non-terminal is replaced by two, so the number of symbols would go to 4, 8, 16, etc. But the given string has 6, which isn't possible because you can't have a string of non-terminals and terminals mixed in a way that the count fits. Wait, but that's not necessarily true because terminals can appear directly. For example, each application of a production can generate some terminals and some non-terminals. So the total number of terminals can vary.\n\nWait, but the starting point is S, which produces two non-terminals. Each of those can produce two more, but some might produce terminals. So the number of terminals can indeed vary. Let me see how the string's length relates. The string has six terminals, but let me see how that can be built up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to check each symbol in the string and see if there's a possible derivation path. Let me try to break down the string:\n\nt27 t24 t53 t14 t33 t27.\n\nFirst, the first symbol is t27, which comes from NT3. So, this suggests that the first non-terminal in the derivation is NT3, which produces t27.\n\nWait, but S starts with NT0 NT4. So after S, the first derivation step could be NT0 producing something and NT4 producing something else.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t27, which is from NT3. But NT0 doesn't produce t27; looking at the grammar, NT0 has a rule NT0 -> NT6 NT7, which itself produces other non-terminals. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is a chain of productions starting from S. Let me try to break it down:\n\n1. S -> NT0 NT4.\n2. Then, NT0 could produce NT6 NT7, and NT4 could produce NT5 NT2.\n3. So now we have NT6 NT7 NT5 NT2.\n4. Then, each of these could branch further.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to parse the string backward, using the parse tree approach. Starting from the end, which is t27, which comes from NT3.\n\nSo, the string ends with t27, which must come from NT3. So, we can think of the string as built by: ... -> NT3 -> t27. So the part before t27 must be the derivation of ... leading up to NT3.\n\nSimilarly, the next to last symbol is t33, which is from NT0, looking at the grammar: NT0 -> 't33' via a production. So the part before t33 must be NT0, which is t33.\n\nThen, t27 comes next before t33. So, let's think of the string as starting from t27 and working backward.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach: looking at the string and seeing if each symbol can be derived correctly based on the grammar.\n\nFirst symbol: t27. As per the grammar, t27 is produced by NT3, which has the production NT3 -> 't72' (from the list), but wait, no. Wait, looking again: the grammar has NT3 -> 't72', but in the given rules, some NT3 rules go to t24 and t53. Wait, no\u2014looking through the rules again:\n\nLooking back, I see that NT3 has rules like T24, T53, etc. So, NT3 can produce 't24' directly, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nSo, the string is t27, t24, t53, t14, t33, t27.\n\nWait, no: I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the grammar rules:\n\n- NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't24'\n- NT3 also has NT3 -> 't53'\n- Similarly, NT3 has other rules, but the important ones for this case are the terminal productions.\n\nSo, the first symbol is 't27', which may come from NT3, but looking at the rules for NT3, I don't see an immediate production for 't27'. Wait, did I miss that? Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules for NT3: I see NT3 -> 't53' and NT3 -> 't24', but none directly produce 't27'. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps 't27' comes from another non-terminal that eventually leads to NT3.\n\nWait, looking through other rules, I don't see NT3 producing 't27'. So, perhaps 't27' comes from another non-terminal, like NT7 or NT4.\n\nLooking at NT7: NT7 has a rule NT7 -> 't13' and another production that includes NT4 and others. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first 't27' is from a non-terminal that leads to it. Let me check the grammar for NT0: NT0 can produce 't23', 't74', etc.\u2014but none of those are 't27'. Similarly, NT2 has 't7' and other terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the grammar again for NT3: looking through all the rules, after NT3 -> 't24' and NT3 -> 't53', I don't see an entry for 't27'. So perhaps 't27' comes from NT3 indirectly through another production. Maybe a longer chain.\n\nWait, perhaps 't27' is a result of a production chain that ends up in a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-111","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with the task of determining whether the given string `t35 t43 t52 t10 t26 t33 t53` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Context-free grammars are built using production rules where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side (RHS) is a sequence of terminal or non-terminal symbols. The goal is to see if the string can be produced by starting from the start symbol and applying the production rules until only terminals remain.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, it's a bit complex with many non-terminals and production rules. Each non-terminal can expand into combinations of other non-terminals or terminals. The terminals seem to be strings like `t35`, `t43`, etc. Wait, actually, upon closer inspection, some symbols like `t14`, `t26`, etc., are written as `tX`, which likely represent terminal symbols. So, each `tX` is a terminal.\n\nNow, the string to check is `t35 t43 t52 t10 t26 t33 t53`. There are seven tokens here, so the derivation path must start from the start symbol S and produce exactly these seven terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet's start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The production rule for S is S -> NT0 NT4. So, to generate the string starting with S, the first step is to expand S into NT0 and NT4. That means the string generated will have sequences from NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, I need to see how NT0 and NT4 can be expanded. Let's look at NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's production rules, one of them is NT0 -> NT5 NT5. Another is NT0 -> NT9 NT7, etc. Hmm, but wait, looking more carefully, each non-terminal has multiple options. So, it's a tree of possibilities. This could get complicated, so maybe I can look for paths that can produce the given string.\n\nThe string starts with `t35`, so perhaps we can find a derivation path that starts with NT0 or NT4 that can produce a `t` followed by numbers. Let's check the productions for NT0 and NT4.\n\nNT0's productions include:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT3 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- Others like NT0 -> NT9 NT7, NT4 -> NT8 NT7, etc.\n\nWait, looking for where NT0 can produce `t35`. Let me check NT3's productions because `t35` is one of them. Looking at NT3's rules:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9\nNT3 -> NT3 NT0\nNT3 -> NT5 NT6\nNT3 -> NT9 NT5\nNT3 -> NT5 NT7\nOther rules like NT3 -> 't24', 't53', 't10', etc.\n\nSo, NT3 can directly produce terminal strings like `t24`, `t53`, `t10`, etc. Specifically, `t10` is one of them.\n\nLooking back at the string: `t35`, `t43`, `t52`, `t10`, etc. So, the fourth element is `t10`, which comes from NT3. So, in the derivation, at some point, we must have a production involving NT3 that produces `t10`.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the derivation goes through NT0 -> NT5 NT5, but let's see.\n\nWait, NT0 can produce `t35` if it's part of the expansion of NT3. But looking at NT0's rules, I don't see a direct production to `t35`. Instead, it seems NT3 is connected to NT0, NT5, etc. So maybe the initial expansion from S leads to NT0 and NT4, and NT0 further expands into other non-terminals and terminals.\n\nLet me try to map a possible path:\n\n1. S -> NT0 NT4\n2. NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n3. NT5 -> NT5 NT2 (e.g., from NT5 -> NT5 NT2)\n   So, NT5 NT5 becomes NT5 NT5 NT2\n   Another possibility: NT5 -> NT3 NT5\n   Or NT5 -> NT7 NT3\n   Or NT5 -> 't33' etc.\n4. Let's see: The string has `t35` as the first token. So, perhaps the first production after S is NT0 -> NT3 NT5.\n   Wait, looking at NT0's rules: NT0 -> NT3 NT5 is there? Let me check:\n\nLooking through NT0's rules, one of them is NT0 -> NT3 NT5. Yes, so NT0 can expand to NT3 NT5.\n\nIf that's the case, then after S, we have NT0 NT4 expanding to NT3 NT5 NT4. So, the first token would be from NT3 or NT5 or NT4.\n\nBut the string starts with `t35`, which can come from NT3 (as `t35` is in NT3's productions) or NT5.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nNT3's rules include:\n\nNT3 -> 't35' (looking at the provided rules, yes, NT3 -> 't35' is present. So, NT3 can directly produce `t35`.\n\nSo, if we have NT3 producing `t35`, then that would be the first token. Then, the next tokens would be from the other non-terminals in the expansion.\n\nSo, starting with S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nIf NT0 -> NT3 NT5, then the entire expansion would be NT3 NT5 NT4.\n\nSo, the first token is `t35` from NT3. Then, the next tokens would come from NT5 and NT4.\n\nNow, let's look at the next token after `t35`, which is `t43`. `t43` must come from somewhere in the expansion. So, let's see what NT5 and NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT5, its production rules include NT5 -> 't43'. Yes, so NT5 can directly produce `t43`.\n\nSo, now we have `t35` from NT3, `t43` from NT5. That's the first two tokens.\n\nNext, the string is `t52`, followed by `t10`, etc. So, the current production is after NT5, which can produce `t43`, then we have NT0 and NT4 left? Wait, no, because S expands to NT0 NT4, and NT0 expands to NT3 NT5, so we have NT3 NT5 NT4.\n\nWait, no, S -> NT0 NT4. Then NT0 -> NT3 NT5, so the entire string is now NT3 NT5 NT4.\n\nBut in the string, after `t35` and `t43` (from NT5), what comes after? The third token is `t52`, which would have to come from NT4. So, NT4 needs to produce `t52` directly.\n\nLooking at NT4's production rules: Do any of them produce `t52`? Let me check. Scanning through NT4's rules, I see NT4 -> 't52' is present (specifically, NT4 -> 't52' is one of the productions). So, NT4 can directly produce `t52`.\n\nSo now, we have `t35` (NT3), `t43` (NT5), `t52` (NT4). Next token is `t10`. Hmm, but after NT4, there are no more non-terminals. Because S -> NT0 NT4, then NT0 -> NT3 NT5, and NT4 is terminal `t52`. So, the derivation up to now would have consumed NT3, NT5, NT4, resulting in three tokens: `t35`, `t43`, `t52`.\n\nBut the string has seven tokens, so we need to generate more. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion path.\n\nWait, let's think again. The initial expansion is S -> NT0 NT4. Then, NT0 can expand into other non-terminals. If I choose NT0 -> NT6 NT7, then we have NT6 NT7 NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NT0 expands into NT9 NT7, which could then expand into terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the full string: `t35 t43 t52 t10 t26 t33 t53`. That's seven tokens. So, the derivation must result in exactly seven terminal symbols, each produced by the non-terminals step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial expansion of S leads to NT0 NT4, which then expands as follows:"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-119","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Hmm, I remember that CNF has certain restrictions, like all production rules having two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol which can go to a single terminal. \n\nOkay, let's start by looking at the grammar given. It seems pretty long, with a bunch of production rules for non-terminals like S, NT0, NT2, and so on. Each rule has two non-terminals on the right side except for some, like NT5 -> NT5 NT2, which I think is allowed because in CNF, any production can be of the form A \u2192 BC, but sometimes starting symbols can produce a single terminal. Wait, no, actually in Chomsky Normal Form, all productions except the start must be of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals. The start symbol can produce a terminal directly. So, in this grammar, S starts as S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which is two non-terminals, so that's fine. But I need to check if any other productions are exceptions.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see some like NT5 -> NT5 NT2, which is allowed because there are no terminals on the right side. So, all look like two non-terminals except perhaps some that might have terminals. Wait, actually, looking again, most of the rules seem to have two non-terminals on the right, but some might have one, but looking closely, they're still two non-terminals. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, for example, NT3 -> 't72' \u2013 that's a terminal, so that would mean a production from a non-terminal to a terminal, which is allowed in CNF, right? No, wait, in CNF, each production must have either two non-terminals or a single non-terminal. Oh wait, no, in CNF, all productions must have exactly two non-terminals on the right side, except for the start symbol, which can go to a single terminal. So, but in this grammar, I see NT3 -> 't72', which is a terminal, meaning that would allow the start symbol to produce a terminal, but does that fit into CNF?\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused now. Let me recall: Chomsky Normal Form requires that every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. But actually, in CNF, all productions except for the start symbol must be A \u2192 BC. The start symbol can have a production of A \u2192 a. So, in this grammar, does each non-terminal except S produce a single terminal? Or do some have two non-terminals?\n\nLooking at the grammar, most of the rules are of the form A \u2192 BC, but some have a terminal on the right, like NT3 -> 't72'. So that would mean that in CNF, each production of a non-terminal except the start must produce a single terminal or two non-terminals. So in this case, the grammar might not be strictly in CNF because some non-terminals produce a terminal directly, but maybe that's allowed. Wait, no, I think CNF allows for a single terminal, so maybe the entire grammar is okay. Hmm, maybe I should proceed assuming the grammar is given in CNF as per the problem statement.\n\nNow, the string to evaluate is `t43 t77 t20 t44 t67 t52 t7`. It's a series of terminal symbols. So, I need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step, seeing how the non-terminals can expand into the terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: t43, t77, t20, t44, t67, t52, t7. That's seven symbols.\n\nFirst, let's see if S can start the process. S -> NT0 NT4. So, the first two parts would be NT0 and NT4.\n\nIn the string, the first two tokens are t43 and t77. So, let's check where t43 and t77 come from.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 can produce NT8 NT6, and from there, when you expand NT8 and NT6, you get various combinations. For example, looking at NT4 -> NT5 NT2, but wait, NT4 also splits into NT8 NT6.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace the possible expansion paths. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t43. Looking at the grammar, NT9 -> 't43', so that's a terminal. So, looking back, any non-terminal that can expand into 't43' is either NT9 or through an intermediate.\n\nSo, let's think of possible paths.\n\nSuppose the first symbol is t43, which comes from NT9. So, how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT9 can be expanded in a few ways:\n\n- NT9 -> 't43' (directly)\n- NT9 -> 't5' (via some other route?)\n\nWait, no. Looking back, the grammar shows that some NT9 production is NT9 -> 't43' directly, so that's straightforward. Similarly, other productions of NT9 lead to terms like 't5', but that's probably not relevant for the first token.\n\nSo, if NT9 is the first part, then the rest must form the rest of the string. But wait, let's see the overall structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this using the CYK algorithm, which is used for parsing in Chomsky Normal Form. CYK is an efficient way to determine if a string is generated by a CFG in CNF. Let me recall how the CYK algorithm works.\n\nThe CYK algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that determines if a string can be generated by a grammar in CNF. It works by constructing a table where each cell P[j][k] represents the set of non-terminals that can derive the substring from position j to position k.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the table: Each single character is a terminal, so we look for non-terminals that can produce that terminal.\n2. For each possible substring length, starting from 2 up to the length of the string, and for each possible starting position j, determine which non-terminals can generate the substring from j to j+len-1.\n3. If the start symbol S is found in the final cell, the string is accepted.\n\nSo, let's start by analyzing the string `t43 t77 t20 t44 t67 t52 t7`. Its length is 7, so the algorithm will start with substrings of length 1, then 2, up to 7.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe there's a better way, perhaps by looking for possible expansions at each step.\n\nAnother approach is to see if each token can be the result of an expansion from a non-terminal, and see if the structure of the grammar allows the string to be generated.\n\nLet me look at the first token: t43. Which non-terminals can produce 't43'? Looking at the grammar, NT9 can produce 't43' (NT9 -> 't43').\n\nSo, the first part of the string could be generated by NT9.\n\nNext, the second token: t77. Looking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't77'? Looking through the productions, I don't immediately see a production that directly gives 't77'. Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some non-terminals can produce terms with two non-terminals:\n\nLooking at NT7 -> 't74' directly? Wait, let's check. Wait, the grammar has:\n\nLooking through all the 'a' productions (terminals), I find:\n\n- NT7 -> 't74'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n-_NT9 -> 't43', 't5', 't60', 't84', etc.\n\nWait, is 't77' a terminal in any of the productions?\n\nWait, in the given grammar, I see NT6 -> 't83', NT5 -> 't33', NT7 -> 't54', etc. Hmm, maybe 't77' isn't directly a terminal. Let me recheck the grammar.\n\nWait, I might have missed it. Let me look again:\n\nLooking through all the terminal productions in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT5 -> 't5'\n- NT7 -> 't43'\n- NT4 -> 't51'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT9 -> 't56' ?? Wait, I'm getting confused.

{"custom_id":"request-137","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string `t42 t62 t57 t53 t76 t35 t7 t7` can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. Hmm, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means all the productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 terminal. That should help because we can systematically parse the string according to the rules.\n\nFirst, I should note that CNF grammars have specific properties. Each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right, except the start symbol which can produce terminals. Wait, actually, in CNF, each production is a single non-terminal on the left, and the right side can be two non-terminals or a terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, the right-hand side must be exactly two non-terminals, right? Because it's a binary tree structure, and each production is left-recursive and has exactly two symbols on the right.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that each production is either S -> NT0 NT4, or something similar. So yes, it's in CNF because the right-hand side has exactly two non-terminals. So each rule has exactly two non-terminals on the right, which can be further expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can model this as a parsing problem using something like a CYK algorithm. Alternatively, we can try to break down the string step by step, seeing if we can derive it from the start symbol S.\n\nBut before jumping into that, maybe it's helpful to look for the start symbol. The start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string must start with whatever NT0 and NT4 can produce. Let's see what NT0 and NT4 can generate.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, both NT0 and NT4 have multiple productions, some of which lead to terminals. For example, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, which can be further broken down. Let's try to find the possible terminals and see if they form the given string.\n\nThe string given is `t42 t62 t57 t53 t76 t35 t7 t7`. So the tokens are t42, t62, t57, t53, t76, t35, t7, t7.\n\nI should check each token and see if they are terminals or non-terminals. From the grammar, NTs like NT0, NT2, NT4, etc., are non-terminals, and some of them expand into other non-terminals or into terminals. The terminals in the grammar are things like 't14', 't47', etc. Wait, in the grammar, there are productions where NTs are replaced by terminals, for example:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'\nNT5 \u2192 't47'\nNT7 \u2192 't13'\nand so on.\n\nSo in the given string, some tokens like t42, t62, etc., are likely terminals. Wait, checking the grammar, for example, NT3 \u2192 't72', but I don't see 't42' in any of the terminals listed. Wait, looking back, let's check all the grammar productions where a terminal is on the right. Scanning through:\n\nLooking for any '...' \u2192 't...'\n\nYes, I see:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'\nNT2 \u2192 't7'\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\nNT8 \u2192 't11'\nNT4 \u2192 't37'\nNT7 \u2192 't54'\nNT5 \u2192 't9' \u2192 Wait, NT5 \u2192 't9' or perhaps looking more closely, do any NTs expand into 't42'? In the list, I don't see any direct terminals for t42.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the grammar has some rules where a non-terminal expands into a single terminal, such as 't42', but looking through the grammar provided, I don't see any NT \u2192 't42'. Hmm, maybe 't42' is a terminal symbol that's generated through a series of productions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo or I'm mislooking.\n\nWait, looking at the end of the grammar, the last line is `NT4 -> 't32'`. So, yes, some NTs are mapped to specific terminals. For example, NT5\u2192't3', so 't3' is a terminal. But I don't see 't42' as a direct terminal. So, perhaps 't42' is generated through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 't42' is a non-terminal, but I don't think so because in the grammar, all terminals are lowercase 't' followed by two digits, but I don't see a NT that expands into that. Or perhaps I'm supposed to assume that 't42' is a terminal in the given string and see if it can be generated.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify: in the grammar, each production's right-hand side is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT3 \u2192 't72' is a terminal. The string we're given is `t42 t62 t57 t53 t76 t35 t7 t7`. So, each token is either a terminal or a non-terminal.\n\nSo, to parse the string, we need to see if each token can be matched by a production. If all tokens are generated by some step in the grammar's derivations, then we can accept the string.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, I don't see any NT expanding into 't42', 't62', etc. So maybe those are non-terminals that are derived through a series of expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. Maybe 't42' is a derived symbol. Let me see if any NT in the grammar can produce 't42'. But looking through the grammar rules, I don't see any such NT\u2192't42'. So perhaps the string has a token that's not in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nWait, no. The grammar's terminals are all listed as 't' followed by two digits, such as 't43', 't14', etc. So, for example, the NT5 \u2192 't47' is a terminal. But if the given string has a 't42', does any NT in the grammar have 't42' as a terminal? Looking through all the production rules, I don't see any NT \u2192 't42'.\n\nHmm, so perhaps that means that 't42' is not a reachable terminal in this grammar, so it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\nThe grammar rules are provided as a long list. I'm looking for any 't42' in the rules.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nAfter NT4 \u2192 't32', the rest don't include 't42'. So it seems that none of the NTs in the grammar directly expand into 't42'. So, if the string has 't42', that's a problem because it can't be derived.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't42' is a terminal that can be reached through some combination of expansions. For instance, maybe NT0\u2192... and eventually reaches 't42' after multiple steps. But looking at the grammar, all NTs seem to expand into other NTs or terminals like 't37', 't54', etc., but not 't42'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the start symbol can reach 't42' through a chain. But without a production that leads to 't42', it's impossible. So I think the string cannot be generated because 't42' isn't present in the grammar.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the string is not generated by the grammar because one of its terminals, 't42', isn't present in the grammar's terminal symbols.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-139","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out whether a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string in question is \"t43 t54 t81 t77 t10 t51 t63 t76\". \n\nFirst, I remember that CNF has specific structures: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, each non-terminal can produce either two non-terminals or a terminal. That should help in analyzing the string step by step.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite extensive. There are over 50 production rules. The start symbol is S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the initial expansion starts with NT0 and NT4. Each of these will need to be broken down further until we reach the terminal symbols.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't's followed by numbers, which are terminal symbols. My job is to see if this sequence can be generated by the grammar. To do this, I might need to build a parse tree starting from the start symbol and see if I can reach the target string.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe I can start from the top-down approach, trying to expand S and see if the string can be a result of that expansion.\n\nS is NT0 NT4. So the string must be the concatenation of the strings generated by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me look at NT0 and NT4. \n\nNT0 has several productions. One of them is NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Another is NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Also, NT0 seems to lead into other non-terminals like NT9, NT7, NT6, etc. Similarly, NT4 has productions like NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nThe string starts with t43, which is an terminal. So let's see which non-terminals produce t43.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t77 (from NT6 \u2192 t77)\n- NT4 has a production to t5, I think.

From the given productions, looking for any production where NTx \u2192 t43. Let's see:\n\nI see NT3 has a production to 't72' and 't31'. NT0 has 't83' and 't40' and others.

Hmm, perhaps I missed it.\n\nLooking through the given rules, I see:\n\nAt the end of the list, there's a line that says NT6 \u2192 t43? Let me check:\n\nLooking at the production rules:\n\nThe last line is:\nNT6 \u2192 t43\n\nWait, yes, under NT6: \"NT6 -> NT8 NT0\" etc., and then later:\n\nLooking through the rule list, I see:\n\nAfter other production rules, one line says:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t43\n\nYes, under the list, there is a rule NT6 -> t43.\n\nSo that means when NT6 is expanded, it can produce the terminal 't43'. Similarly, looking for others:\n\nLooking for 't43' terminal in the rules:\n\nLooking through each production line, I can see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- Other NT3 productions: t53, t39, etc.\n- NT5 has some t's, like t47, t33, etc.\n- NT6 has t43.\n- NT0 has several t's like t043 (wait, no, perhaps I should count them correctly).\nWait, in the rules, 't' is followed by a number. Each Nt is NT followed by a number, like NT0, NT1, etc., and sometimes they produce terminals like t10, t54, etc.\n\nWait, the string has t43, t54, t81, etc. So I'm trying to find where each of these t's can come from.\n\nSo for the string \"t43 t54 t81 t77 t10 t51 t63 t76\", I need to see for each of these terminals whether they can be produced by specific non-terminals.\n\nBut let me structure this step by step, starting from the start symbol.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string will be the concatenation of the expansion of NT0 and NT4.\n\nSo split the given string into two parts: the first part (from S's NT0) and the second part (from S's NT4). But wait, that might not be accurate because the actual expansion might not be just two parts, depending on how the non-terminals expand. However, a possible first approach is to check if one part starts with NT0's expansion and the other with NT4's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string can be split into the concatenation of two parts where each part can be generated by NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, let's try to see if the starting symbols align.\n\nAnother approach is to check all possible ways the string could have been built step by step through the grammar.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming. Instead, let me try to see for each terminal in the string where it can be generated from.\n\nSo let's list the terminals in the string: t43, t54, t81, t77, t10, t51, t63, t76.\n\nFirst, t43 comes first. Looking through the rules, the only way to get 't43' is from NT6 \u2192 t43. So t43 must come from NT6.\n\nSo the first component is NT6. That would mean, in the expansion of NT0 (as S is NT0 NT4), the first part must generate t43 through NT6.\n\nNow, t43 is the first symbol, so perhaps the first part is NT0 expanding into something that leads to 't43'.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7; NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7; NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5; etc.\n\nSo maybe NT0 expands into a path that eventually ends with NT6, which can produce t43.\n\nLet me see if that's possible.\n\nStarting with NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nThen NT6 is t43, so that's good. Now, what about NT7? NT7 can expand into various things, including NT4 NT0 (from NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0), or others.\n\nWait, let's see: the first symbol is t43, which is from NT6. So the next symbol comes from NT7.\n\nSo after t43, we have t54. So the next symbol is t54.

{"custom_id":"request-154","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to check if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, okay, let's start by breaking down the components.\n\nFirst, the grammar provided is pretty extensive. It consists of multiple production rules for various terminals and non-terminals. The string to evaluate is `t12 t73 t42 t60 t77 t43 t10 t83 t60`. My task is to determine if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using these rules.\n\nI remember that in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to follow that structure. So each rule in the grammar either breaks down a non-terminal into two non-terminals or into a single terminal.\n\nSince the string is a sequence of terminals, the derivation must consist of expanding non-terminals into terminals. Each step replaces a non-terminal with two others, which ultimately result in the terminals in the string.\n\nWait, the string has nine tokens. Chomsky normal form derivations typically result in strings where the number of symbols increases with each step. Starting from S, each expansion doubles the depth, but the actual number of terminals can vary. The string length here is nine, which may or may not fit depending on the depth of the tree.\n\nBut let's think differently. Perhaps I can reconstruct the parse tree or trace the derivation step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can map each terminal in the string to a possible derivation path from S, ensuring that each terminal is produced by some rule.\n\nLooking at the terminal tokens: t12, t73, t42, t60, t77, t43, t10, t83, t60.\n\nI notice that several of these terminals have specific rules. For example, t12 is derived from NT0, which from the grammar: NT0 -> 't23' or other combinations. Wait, actually, looking back, several entries like NT0 -> 't43' (from NT0), which is t43. So t43 is a terminal.\n\nBut wait, some NT rules derive into terminals. For instance, NT9 -> 't52', NT3 -> 't77', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to create a mapping from each terminal to their production rules. Let me go through the grammar and note where each terminal appears:\n\n- Looking through all the productions, for each terminal, I can find which non-terminal produces it.\n\nFrom NT0 -> 't43': so t43 comes from NT0.\n\nFrom NT5 -> 't47': t47 from NT5.\n\nWait, but in our string, I don't see any of these. The string only has t12, t73, t42, t60, t77, t43, t10, t83, t60.\n\nLet me check where these appear:\n\n- t43: appears in NT0 -> 't43'\n- t10: NT9 -> 't10'? Wait, looking at the productions:\nNT9 -> 't52' (from the grammar), so t52, not t10. Wait, did I read that correctly? Let me reread the grammar rules.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT5 -> 't33', so t33 from NT5.\n\nWait, no t10 is from NT6 -> NT9 NT7, and perhaps some other rule. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar, there is a rule NT0 -> NT9 NT7, which leads to t43. Let me confirm the productions for NT9 and NT7.\n\nLooking through:\n\nNT9: Let's see:\n\nNT9 -> 't52' (one rule), but another rule is NT9 -> NT5 NT6 (from NT3: NT3 -> NT9 NT6, perhaps? Wait, no, NT3's production was already in the list, but looking through:\n\nWait, the rule for NT6 is: NT6 -> NT7 NT9 and others. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's take each terminal and see where it appears as a terminal in the rules.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the grammar, the rules where a terminal is on the right side:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT3 -> 't77'\n- NT5 -> 't10' ?

The string to evaluate is `t62 t22 t7 t57 t20 t73 t10 t60 t69`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what CNF means. From what I remember, in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left side, except for the start symbol, which might be rewritten. Wait, no, actually, CNF requires each production to have at most two symbols on the right side. So, each production either is A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, I see productions like S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and other non-terminals branching into other non-terminals or terminals. So, yes, this grammar is in CNF because all the right-hand sides are either two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how to determine if the given string can be derived from this grammar. The string consists of a series of terminals: t62, t22, t7, t57, t20, t73, t10, t60, t69.\n\nI think the approach here is to use a parsing strategy, maybe something like the CYK algorithm, which is efficient for context-free grammars. But since the string is relatively short, I might be able to work through it step by step manually.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reverse-engineer the derivation. Since the string starts with t62, I should look for the non-terminals that produce t62. Looking through the rules, I see NT0 \u2192 t23 and NT4 \u2192 t32. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I should check for NT_x productions that result in t62.\n\nWait, let me look for t62 first. Scanning the rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT5 \u2192 t33\n- NT7 \u2192 t43\n- NT3 \u2192 t51\n- NT4 \u2192 t5\n- NT7 \u2192 t70\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT5 \u2192 t3\n- NT0 \u2192 t74\n- NT8 \u2192 t21\n- NT4 \u2192 t84\n- NT4 \u2192 t9\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT8 \u2192 t84\n- NT8 \u2192 t81\n- NT0 \u2192 t28\n- NT4 \u2192 t7\n- NT4 \u2192 t27\n- NT0 \u2192 t62\nAh, there it is. NT0 \u2192 t62. So the first symbol t62 must come from NT0. So we start with NT0.\n\nNow, the next step is to look at how NT0 is produced. Looking at the rules, NT0 can produce several things. I see multiple NT0 \u2192 NTx Ny productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. But in the first production, it's generating t62 directly, so the rest of the string should be generated by NT0, perhaps through a series of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by breaking down the string into parts and seeing how they could be derived. Let's consider the string as a sequence of terminals and see how each could be produced.\n\nThe string is t62 t22 t7 t57 t20 t73 t10 t60 t69.\n\nStarting with t62, which comes from NT0. Now, the production for NT0 could be something like NT0 \u2192 NTx NTy, expanding into more non-terminals, ultimately leading to other symbols.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to build the parse tree upwards. So the root would be S, which produces NT0 NT4. Then each NT0 and NT4 would produce their respective parts.\n\nBut the given string starts with t62, which is part of the NT0 expansion. So let's look at how NT0 can generate t62. From earlier, NT0 \u2192 t62 is one of the productions, so that's a direct step. That means the entire string would have to be derived from NT0. \n\nWait, but the string is a concatenation of several terminals. If NT0 expands directly to t62, then the rest of the string (t22, t7, etc.) must come from the NT4 in the S \u2192 NT0 NT4 production. So the S production is NT0 followed by NT4. So the first part of the string, t62, comes from NT0, and the next part, t22, must come from NT4. Wait, but let me check the production for NT4.\n\nLooking back, NT4 \u2192 t37, t8, t70, etc. Wait, but wait, in the provided grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 t37 and other more complex rules. Alternatively, perhaps NT4 can produce t22. Let me check the rules. Scanning the NT4 productions, I see NT4 \u2192 t37, NT4 \u2192 t8, NT4 \u2192 t70, NT4 \u2192 t9, etc. Wait, t22 isn't directly a production of NT4. But maybe through other steps. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Let me think again. The start symbol is S. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be generated by NT0 followed by NT4. So the string would be the concatenation of what NT0 generates and what NT4 generates.\n\nGiven that, the string is t62 t22 t7 t57 t20 t73 t10 t60 t69. So, after t62, the next part is t22, which would come from NT4. So I need to see if NT4 can generate t22.\n\nLooking through NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n\nWait, but none of these are terminals. So perhaps through these productions, NT4 eventually expands into terminals. For example, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Now, NT5 can produce t33 and other things. Let's see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 t10, etc. Wait, looking at the rules, I see NT5 \u2192 t10, NT5 \u2192 t47, etc. So maybe NT5 can eventually produce t22 through some chain.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the CYK algorithm, which involves parsing the string and checking if it can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to count the number of symbols. The string has 9 symbols, which should correspond to a specific number of productions in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the string is 9 tokens, and in Chomsky Normal Form, each production reduces the number of non-terminals by one. So the number of steps needed to derive the string would be related to the number of symbols minus one, but considering that each step can break down a non-terminal into two symbols.\n\nI think the CYK algorithm might be the way to go, but maybe I can try a simple approach. Let me try to see if the string can be generated step by step.\n\nAnother approach is to build a parse tree starting from S and see if it can produce the string.\n\nSo, S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, NT0 can produce t62 directly, so the first token is t62. Now, the next part is t22, which comes from NT4. Let's look at how NT4 can produce t22. But looking at NT4's productions, all are non-terminals. So perhaps NT4 needs to be broken down into terminals via other productions.\n\nPerhaps NT4 can produce something that leads to t22. Wait, maybe NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT2, and one of the subsequent productions of NT0 could produce more tokens. Alternatively, NT2 might produce t22 directly.\n\nLooking at NT2's rules: NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6, NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2, etc. I don't see NT2 \u2192 t22 directly. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check all NT2 productions. Here's the list of NT2 rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT9\n- NT2 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT2 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n\nHmm, none of these directly produce t22. So maybe t22 comes from another non-terminal. Wait, maybe from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky normal form (CNF) has productions where each non-terminal is rewritten as two non-terminals or a terminal. My grammar seems to fit this as all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A and B are non-terminals and C is a terminal or another non-terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which according to the grammar, is rewritten as NT0 NT4. So, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. This means that every derivation starts with NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, I need to check if the string can be formed through a series of productions starting from S, eventually breaking down into terminals only. Each terminal in the string is like 't23', which seems to correspond to a production where NT23 \u2192 't23', and similarly for others.\n\nLooking at the string: t23 t17 t70 t12 t8 t67 t76 t26 t62 t74.\n\nI think each of these corresponds to a non-terminal. So, the string would be generated if the production rules result in these terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet's start with S. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the string must expand into sequences from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me list the non-terminals present in the string: NT0, NT17, NT23, NT70, NT12, NT8, NT67, NT76, NT26, NT62, NT74.\n\nWait, but the non-terminals in the grammar are many, so perhaps each 't' corresponds to a specific non-terminal. For example, 't23' is derived from NT23 \u2192 t23.\n\nSo, the idea is that each step in the derivation from S should produce these sequences, ending in the given string.\n\nI'm a bit confused because the process would involve expanding NT0 and NT4 into other non-terminals recursively until we reach terminals. It's like a binary tree where each production depends on two nodes.\n\nMaybe I should try to see the paths each terminal might take. For example, 't23' comes from NT23 \u2192 t23, so NT23 must derive to t23. Let me check if NT23 is defined.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nWait, but I'm looking for NT23. Scanning through all the NT definitions:\n\nI see lines like NT0 -> NT6 NT7, NT2 -> 't7', etc. Hmm, looking through all the non-terminals, I don't immediately see 'NT23' in their productions. Wait, actually, the user's grammar has many NTs, and some have 't' as terminals. For example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23' (Yes, in the list: NT0 -> 't23' is defined.)\n\nSimilarly, NT77 exists but isn't relevant here. Let me check each terminal in the string:\n\nt23: NT0 \u2192 t23 is allowed.\n\nt17: Looking for NT17. In the production rules, I don't see NT17 \u2192 't17' explicitly. Wait, maybe NT17 is a parent of t17? Let me check the grammar. Scanning all productions for NT17: there's NT5 \u2192 t3 (from line: NT5 -> 't3'), but no NT17 \u2192 t17. So t17 must be produced by NT17, which is defined in some production. Wait, but looking through the grammar, nowhere does NT17 produce a terminal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Are all the terminals given explicitly? Let me see. The grammar includes lines like:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23'\nNT7 \u2192 't13'\nNT0 \u2192 't43' (from NT0 -> ... 't43')\n\nSo each terminals like 't23' are defined by specific NTs. So, for t17 to be present, there must be an NT17 \u2192 t17. But looking through the grammar, I don't see any NT17 \u2192 't17'. So does that mean 't17' is not present in the language? Or perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grammar. Let me scan for NT17:\n\nLooking at all the NT entries:\n\nI see NT3 \u2192 't23' (from NT3 \u2192 't72'?

Let me check each line.\n\nLooking for the start symbol, S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, the string starts with t23, which is from NT0 \u2192 t23. But then the next is t17. So we need to see if after producing t23, the remaining NT4 can produce the rest of the string.\n\nBut NT4 in the grammar has multiple productions, like NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT2, and so on. So, perhaps the problem is that 't17' is not a terminal in any of the NT definitions, implying that 't17' can't appear in the string generated by the grammar. Therefore, the string isn't in the language.\n\nWait, no. Let me make sure. Wait, in the grammar, I don't see any NT that leads directly to 't17'. So unless 't17' is a terminal defined elsewhere, which doesn't seem to be the case. Therefore, 't17' can't be part of the generated string.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string `t23 t17 t70 t12 t8 t67 t76 t26 t62 t74` contains `t17`, which corresponds to a non-terminal `NT17`.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or terminal strings. The start symbol is S, and from the productions, I see S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So any string generated by this grammar starts with NT0 followed by NT4, right?\n\nLooking at the input string, the first two tokens are t44 and t60. Wait, but S starts with NT0 and NT4. So the first part should be NT0 and then NT4. So the first token should be whatever NT0 can derive, and the second token should be whatever NT4 can derive.\n\nLet me check what NT0 and NT4 derive. Scanning the productions:\n\nNT0: It has multiple productions, mostly involving itself. Let's see: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. It looks like NT0 can be expanded into various combinations of NT6 and NT7, or other NTs.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has several productions. From the given, NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, etc. So, in the input string, the first token is t44, and that comes from NT0. Looking at the productions for NT0, which terminal does it produce? Let's see. There's a production NT0 \u2192 't23' as well as others. So if NT0 \u2192 't23', then t44 might come from a different expansion path.\n\nWait, in the given string, the first token is t44. Let me look at NT0's productions. I see NT0 \u2192 't23' and a few others like NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. But where does t44 come from? Looking back at NT0's productions, I don't see a production where NT0 directly goes to t44. Checking all NT0 productions:\n\nLooking at the provided NT0 productions, the direct terminals are 't23', 't54', 't80', 't74', 't63', 't60', 't83', etc. Wait, wait. There's NT0 \u2192 't60' directly. Yes, under the list, I see 'NT0 -> 't60''. So if NT0 directly produces 't60', then the first token in the string is 't44' which isn't 't60'. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something about how the grammar works.\n\nWait, perhaps the first token is 't44', which must come from NT0's expansion path. Let me check if NT0 can produce 't44' through a chain of productions. Looking through the productions, do any NTs leading to NT0 produce 't44'? Let me check NT0's productions for possible terminal outputs. I spot NT0 \u2192 't60' and also NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, which could lead to more NTs. But 't44' doesn't directly appear in NT0's productions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. The first part of the string starts with t44, which suggests that S starts with NT0 \u2192 something that produces t44 in the first step. But from the given grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two non-terminals are NTo and NT4. But the first token is 't44', so perhaps NTo must derive a string that starts with t44, and NT4 must derive a string that starts with t60, so the first two tokens are 't44 t60'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT4, we have NT4 \u2192 't28' (since in the list, I see NT4 -> 't28'). Also, NT4 can derive to things like NT5 NT2. Let's see if any of these paths can lead to 't44' as the first token.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t44 comes from a chain where NT0 produces another NT which eventually produces t44. But looking through the NT0 productions, let's see: NT0 can go to NT6 NT7, which in turn can go to NT5 NT5, etc. But how do any of them lead to t44? Alternatively, maybe I need to look through all the productions to see if any NT can directly produce t44.\n\nWait, in the provided list, I see NT0 \u2192 't60' directly. So unless there is a production for NT0 \u2192 t44, it's impossible for the string to start with t44. Let me scan all the NT0 productions: I don't see any that directly produce t44. Therefore, the first token 't44' cannot come from NT0, which means the entire string cannot be generated by the grammar, right?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because maybe through a chain of derivations, NT0 can produce t44. For example, NT0 might produce NT7 NT9, and so on. Let me try to see if t44 can be derived from NT0 via some path.\n\nLooking back at the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 't13', 't17', etc., and NT9 can produce 't43', 't53', etc. Let me try to see the possible paths.\n\nLet me consider NT0's production NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\nSo NT0 can be NT6 and NT7. Let's explore NT6: looking at the productions, NT6 can go to NT7 NT9, which then can go to various NTs. Alternatively, NT6 might go to NT9 NT8, then NT9 to NT5 NT7, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the first token is 't44', and it's not produced directly by NT0 or any of the NTs that come from it, maybe t44 doesn't appear in the grammar's terminal symbols. So the string starting with 't44' cannot be generated by the grammar because none of the NTs start with t44.\n\nWait, but looking through all the NTs, perhaps t44 is a result of some longer derivation. Let me check for any NT that can produce t44 in a chain.\n\nLooking at NT3: NT3 can produce 't72', 't24', etc. Not t44. NT5 can produce 't47', 't27', etc. Not t44. NT2 can produce 't7', 't63', etc. Not t44. Similarly, NT4 has 't28' and others. So perhaps the only way t44 could appear is if it's a result of concatenating some NTs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't44' is part of a longer string, but the first token is t44. But how would that work? Because in Chomsky normal form, each step produces exactly two symbols, either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal? Wait, no, in CNF, each production is A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal.\n\nWait, in this grammar, all the productions seem to result in two symbols, but the terminals are multi-character. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23' is a production where the terminal is a single character, 't'. So each production either outputs two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC) or a terminal (A \u2192 a).\n\nIn Chomsky normal form, a production can be A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal, or A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, in the string, each token is either a single terminal or the result of combining two symbols derived from non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the given string, the first token is 't44', which must be directly produced by one of the NTs. But looking through all the NTs:\n\nNT0: Does NT0 \u2192 't44' anywhere? No, the closest is 't23'. Similarly, looking for 't44' in any NT's productions, I don't see it. So t44 cannot be a terminal produced directly by any NT.\n\nTherefore, the string can't start with 't44' because none of the NTs can produce it as a terminal. Thus, the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe some derivation from NT0 leads to a string that starts with 't44'. For example, maybe NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and NT6 \u2192 something that leads to the first symbol being t44 via some chain.\n\nLet me explore this possibility.\n\nNT6 can produce multiple things: For example, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, and then NT9 can produce 't43', 't53', etc. Alternatively, NT8"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-192","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t76 t33 t15 t26 t44 t11 t17 t72 t12 t60 t42` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, C-F grammar... I remember it's structured in a way where each production is either a single non-terminal, or two non-terminals. Wait, no, Chomsky normal form requires each production to be on the left, with right-hand side consisting of either two non-terminals or one terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's a bit complex with a lot of production rules. Let me try to understand how the string is built.\n\nFirst, the string is a sequence of terminals: `t76`, `t33`, `t15`, `t26`, `t44`, `t11`, `t17`, `t72`, `t12`, `t60`, `t42`. So each of these is a terminal symbol, which I assume corresponds to a rule in the grammar.\n\nI need to check if this string can be derived from the start symbol S through the productions of the grammar. The string is a series of steps where each non-terminal expands into two terminals. Wait, no, each production can be any of the rules, so I have to see if each of these terminals can be formed from the productions.\n\nWait, let me think. In a C-F grammar in normal form, each production is either A->BC where A is a non-terminal and B,C are non-terminals, or A->a where a is a terminal. So each string can be viewed as a tree where each node is a non-terminal and the leaves are terminals. Alternatively, the string can be generated by a series of leftmost or rightmost derivations.\n\nGiven the string, it has 11 terminals. Since each production expands a non-terminal into two symbols (either two non-terminals or a terminal and a non-terminal, etc.), the length of the string after each step increases by one more symbol. So from S, starting with length 2, each step adds two symbols (if non-terminals are expanded), leading the string length to eventually have an odd number? Wait, no. Wait, each production S-> NT0 NT4 expands into two non-terminals, so the length increases by one each time a non-terminal is replaced by two. So starting from S (length 1), each expansion steps would increase the length by one.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the string as a full derivation. The given string has 11 symbols, which is an odd number. Since starting from S (1 symbol), each production adds one symbol, the total number of symbols after k derivations would be 1 + k. So for 11 symbols, k=10. So we have 10 steps of expansion from S.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Alternatively, perhaps each production is applied recursively, but since the string is a sequence of terminals, each terminal must have been generated in a single step from a production.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see multiple production rules for some non-terminals. But the key is to see if each terminal in the string corresponds to a production path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try to parse the string using the grammar. Let's see. Parsing context-free grammars can be done with a recursive descent parser or other methods, but I'm not sure if I can simulate that here.\n\nLet me try to break down the string:\n\nt76 t33 t15 t26 t44 t11 t17 t72 t12 t60 t42\n\nI need to see if each of these can be obtained by expanding non-terminals in the correct order.\n\nLet me see if I can find a chain of productions that builds up this string. Starting from S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S would expand into NT0 NT4, which would then each expand into something.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has several productions. Let's see:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7 or NT5 NT5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if I can find a path from S down to the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can work backwards, trying to reduce the string step by step to see if it can be reduced to S.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLooking at the string, the last symbol is t42. I need to see if t42 can be generated by some non-terminal. Looking at the grammar, are there any productions that have t42 as the right-hand side?\n\nLooking at the rules, I don't see any production that directly produces t42. Wait, let me check:\n\nNT4 -> t37 (via production NT4 -> NT0 NT2, but wait, no, wait, the grammar has NT4 with multiple rules, for example, NT4-> t8, t32, t7, t9, t84, etc. But in the given grammar, NT4 has a production to t42? Let me check.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 -> t37, but also:\n\nWait, in the rules provided, looking through, I see:\n\n\"NT4 -> t37\", \"NT4 -> t32\", \"NT4 -> t7\", \"NT4 -> t9\", \"NT4 -> t84\", \"NT4 -> t8\", \"NT4 -> t5\", \"NT4 -> t3\", \"NT4 -> t32\", \"NT4 -> t9\", \"NT4 -> t43\", etc. \n\nWait, is there a production for NT4 that includes t42? Let me check:\n\nWait, in the list provided, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT0 NT3\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT5 NT6\nWait, not finding t42. Hmm, but looking again:\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let's look for any production that ends with t42. Scanning through all the rules, I don't see any terminal symbols as t42. Hmm. So perhaps t42 is generated by a non-terminal that has a production ending with t42. But I don't see any such terminals.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because if the last symbol in the string is t42, and there's no production for t42, then it's impossible. So maybe the answer is No.\n\nBut let me double-check the rules to ensure I didn't miss a t42.\n\nLooking again:\n\nLooking through the list, the productions are like:\n\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT0 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT14 (but that's in another part)\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check all rules for t42.\n\nWait, the rules provided include:\n\n- NT5 -> t51\n- NT8 -> t84\n- NT8 -> t81\n- NT4 -> t43\n- NT4-> t7\n- etc.\n\nBut is there a production that generates t42? I don't see it. So perhaps t42 is not generated by any production, making the string invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the grammar. Let me check if any non-terminal can produce t42.\n\nLooking through the grammar, most terminals are things like t76, t33, etc., but nothing seems to produce t42. So, for example, looking for NT4->t42 or any NT like NT8->t42, etc.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- NT4->NT3 NT7\n- NT4->NT7 NT8\n- NT6->NT0 NT2\n- NT8->NT6 NT8\n- etc.\n\nWait, perhaps some indirect production. Maybe a non-terminal can produce t42 through a chain of expansions. For example, a path like NT4 -> something -> something -> t42.\n\nLet's see:\n\nLooking at the rules, perhaps NT4 can produce NT5 NT2. Let me check:\n\nNT4->NT5 NT2.\n\nLooking at NT5's rules: NT5 has multiple productions, like NT5->NT6 NT7, NT5->NT3 NT9, etc. Let's see where this leads.\n\nSuppose NT4 produces NT5 NT2.\n\nThen NT5 could produce NT6 NT7.\n\nThen NT6 could produce NT8 NT8.\n\nAnd so on. But I'm not sure if any path leads to t42.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that since t42 is not a terminal in any production, it's impossible to generate. So perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and there exists a path where a non-terminal expands to a terminal string that includes t42. Let me check all the possible terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, the terminals used are t76, t33, t15, t26, t44, t11, t17, t72, t12, t60, t42. None of these appear as terminals in any production.

{"custom_id":"request-198","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string `t43 t43 t64 t11 t70 t56 t33 t7 t20 t17 t53` is generated by the provided grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule has two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. \n\nFirst, I should look at the starting symbol S and see how it can produce the string through a series of expansions. According to the grammar, S -> NT0 NT4. So, the string starts with NT0 followed by NT4. Let me check if the given string starts with these components.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't43' and the second is also 't43'. From the production rules, NT0 can derive into 't43' directly, as NT0 -> 't43'. Similarly, NT4 can also derive into 't43'. So the first two tokens match so far.\n\nNext, third token is 't64'. I need to see what NT0 can produce after the second 't43'. Looking at the NT0 rules, it can produce 't64' as NT0 -> 't64 NT8' or NT0 -> 't64'. Wait, but NT0 is a non-terminal, so it must expand further. Let me check the rules for NT0 again. Oh, looking at the grammar, NT0 has several rules, including NT0 -> NT9 NT7 and NT0 -> 't43'. So maybe the expansion of NT0 leads to 't43', but in the string, the third token is 't64', which suggests that NT0 is expanding to something that starts with 't64', perhaps via NT6.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT6 can produce 't77' (like NT6 -> 't77') and 't43' (NT6 -> 't43'). Wait, but NT0 can also expand to NT6 NT7. Let me look into how NT0 can produce 't64'. Maybe through another path, like NT0 -> NT8 NT6. Hmm, but in the third position, we have 't64', which is a terminal. So how does NT0 become 't64'? Looking at the rules, let me see if any of the NT0 rules produce 't64'. Wait, looking through the list, I don't see a direct rule for NT0 -> 't64'. Hmm, but wait, maybe through another intermediate step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about how the symbols expand. Maybe I need to track the expansion paths step by step.\n\nLet's outline the string: t43 t43 t64 t11 t70 t56 t33 t7 t20 t17 t53.\n\nFirst, S expands to NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols are t43 and t43, which matches.\n\nNow, the third symbol is t64. So NT0 must expand into something that starts with t64. Looking at the production rules for NT0, it can expand into NT9 NT7 or other combinations, but to get a terminal, perhaps one of the productions ends there.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar rules:\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> 't43'\n\nSo, NT0 can produce 't43' directly, but how do we get 't64' from NT0? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, looking at NT6, which is a non-terminal, and its rules include NT6 -> 't64'. So 't64' is a terminal that NT6 can produce. So, if any production for a non-terminal results in ending with 't64', that's possible. For example, NT6 is a non-terminal that can produce 't64' directly. So, if any derivation leads to NT6, then after expansion, it would produce 't64'.\n\nSo, let me think about how S -> NT0 NT4 can break down further. The first NT0 would need to produce 't64' at some point. But since NT0 itself doesn't have a production for 't64', maybe NT0 expands into NT6 NT7, and then those non-terminals expand into other symbols, eventually leading to 't64'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT0 isn't expanding directly to 't64', but part of a longer expansion. Let's consider the full expansion steps.\n\nSo, starting from S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThe first part (from NT0) needs to produce 't43' (which it can do), and the second part (NT4) also needs to produce 't43' (it can do). But in the string, after the first two 't43's, the third token is 't64', which suggests that the third part of the expansion (from NT0) needs to produce 't64'.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let me consider that NT0 and NT4 are two separate non-terminals that each produce a token, so in the initial expansion, S produces two tokens: first NT0 which becomes 't43', and NT4 which becomes 't43', so the two 't43's.\n\nThen, after that, perhaps NT0 and NT4 can further expand to produce more tokens. So after the first S expansion, we have to consider the next level of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a parse tree. Let's try building the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with the string: [t43, t43, t64, t11, t70, t56, t33, t7, t20, t17, t53]\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n   So, the first token (t43) is from NT0, the second (t43) from NT4.\n\n2. Now, after the first two tokens, we have the remaining tokens: ['t64', 't11', 't70', 't56', 't33', 't7', 't20', 't17', 't53'].\n\n   Now, we need to parse the next token 't64' from either NT0 or NT4. Wait, but since NT0 and NT4 are separate, perhaps after their initial expansion, they can further split. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the initial S -> NT0 NT4 as a single step, which produces two tokens. But the string starts with t43, t43, so that matches.\n\nAfter the initial S expansion, we're left with the next token 't64', but actually, the string after the first two tokens is ['t64', 't11', ...], so the initial production S -> NT0 NT4 has already produced two tokens. Now, those two tokens have been consumed, so the rest is 't64', 't11', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's think of the string as a sequence where each production step appends symbols, including both non-terminals and terminals. So, the parse tree would have to derive the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by trying to find a derivation path from S to the entire string.\n\nLet me try to see if each part of the string can be mapped to a production.\n\n1. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, first NT0 \u2192 't43', and NT4 \u2192 't43', which gives the first two tokens.\n\n2. Now, we're left with ['t64', 't11', 't70', 't56', 't33', 't7', 't20', 't17', 't53'].\n\n   The next token is 't64', so let's see what can produce 't64'. Looking at the grammar, NT6 has a production NT6 \u2192 't64', so if NT0 expands into NT6 and then that produces 't64', then the third token would be 't64'.\n\n   So, maybe S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then NT6 \u2192 't64', and NT7 can produce some symbols that we'll have to see.\n\n   Let's see: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7.\n\n   So, after the initial S expansion, we have:\n\n   NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n   NT4 \u2192 't43'\n\n   Then the third token from NT6 \u2192 't64'. So the third token is 't64'.\n\n   Now, the fourth token is 't11', which would come from NT7.\n\n   So, after NT6 produces 't64', NT7 needs to produce 't11'.\n\n   Looking at the production rules for NT7: NT7 \u2192 't17', 't43', 't70', etc.\n\n   Wait, so is it possible for NT7 to produce 't11' directly? Looking through the rules, I don't see any direct production for NT7"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-212","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string to evaluate. My task is to determine if the string is generated by the grammar. The string is `t21 t13 t40 t7 t23 t24 t54 t53 t60 t73 t43 t32`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the grammar looks like. It's structured with a start symbol S, and the production rules all seem to be in the form A \u2192 BC, except for S which has two non-terminals. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is binary, which is helpful for parsing. \n\nLooking at the start rule, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string must derive down to S, which is two non-terminals NT0 and NT4. Each of these non-terminals can further split into other non-terminals, and this continues until I reach the terminals.\n\nThe string consists of a series of 't' followed by two-digit numbers: t21, t13, t40, etc. These are likely the terminals that will appear at the leaves of the parse tree if the string is in the language.\n\nThe approach I should take is to construct a parse tree starting from S and see if it can derive the given string. Alternatively, I can see if the string can be reduced step by step using the productions.\n\nI think it's easier to go step by step, trying to break down the string into parts that match the grammar's productions. Let's list out the tokens:\n\nt21, t13, t40, t7, t23, t24, t54, t53, t60, t73, t43, t32.\n\nI'll consider the string from left to right, trying to split it into parts that match the productions.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So we'll need two subtrees: one from NT0 and one from NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first part of NT0 could handle the initial tokens, and the second part of NT4 would handle the rest. Alternatively, maybe it's more complex. Let me look for NT0 and NT4 productions.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7 | NT9 NT7 | NT9 NT0 | NT5 NT5 | NT7 NT0 | NT7 NT7.\n\nSimilarly, NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6 | NT5 NT2 | NT3 NT3 | NT4 NT3 | NT0 NT8 | NT7 NT0 | NT0 NT7 | NT4 NT7 | NT0 NT0 | NT7 NT7 | NT6 NT6 | NT7 NT6 | etc.\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Let me see if I can find a path that matches the string.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can start from the beginning of the string and see which non-terminal can generate the first token.\n\nThe first token is t21. Looking at which NT can produce t21. Looking through the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see a direct production for NT0, NT1... looking for t21, maybe in NT6 or NT8?\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\nNT6 -> ... t60, t77, t43, t28, t61, t26, t39, t24, t93, t31, t20, t73, etc.\n\nWait, in the rules for NT6:\n\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0: So this is a binary production, so it's a non-terminal expanding into two non-terminals, which then expand into terminals. But none of the terminal productions for NT6 are directly showing 't21', but I do see NT8 \u2192 t53, t84, which would mean NT8 can produce t53, t84, etc.\n\nWait, let me check NT6 and NT8 productions. \n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t77, t43, t28, t61, t26, t39, t24, t93, t31, t20, t73, t8.\n\nSimilarly, NT8 produces t53, t84, t56, t60, t73, t64, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the string, the first token is t21, which isn't listed as any of the immediate terminals. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the string given is:\n\nt21 t13 t40 t7 t23 t24 t54 t53 t60 t73 t43 t32.\n\nSo t21 is the first token. Looking at the list of terminals at the end of the rules:\n\nt21 appears in NT8 \u2192 t84, t81, t84, etc. Wait, in the rules, NT8's productions include:\n\nNT8 \u2192 t53, t84, t56, t60, t73, t64, t57, etc.\n\nWait, none of the immediate productions for NT6 or NT8 produce t21. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe I need to look deeper. Alternatively, maybe the first part is from NT0 and the second part from NT4.\n\nBut wait, maybe the first token t21 is part of a larger substring within NT0 or NT4. For example, perhaps the first token is part of NT6's expansion, which is t24. Wait, no, t24 is in NT6.\n\nWait, maybe I should map each token to the NTs that can produce it, then see how they can link together.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to try building the parse tree step by step, but it's time-consuming. Since the problem is complex, perhaps it's easier to try a reduction approach, trying to reduce the string to the start symbol.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I can list which NTs can produce the given tokens and see if the entire string can be split accordingly.\n\nLooking at the first token, t21. Wait, in the given rules, t21 is not a terminal directly, but looking at the end of the rules:\n\nAfter NT0, NT5, etc., I see several rules ending with various t's. For example:\n\nNT6 -> t83, t43, t67, t54, t5, etc.\n\nSo for NT6, the terminals produced are t77, t43, t28, t61, t26, t39, t24, t93, t31, t20, t73, etc. Does that include t21? I don't see t21 here. Similarly, NT8's terminals are t53, t84, t56, t60, t73, t64, etc. Also no t21. So perhaps t21 is part of a longer non-terminal chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the rules. Wait, sometimes the production rules might have terminals in the right places. For example, looking back, I see:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t67, etc. Hmm, I don't see t21 in the list. Alternatively, maybe t21 is produced by another NT, but looking through the rules again, I don't see any that directly produce t21.\n\nWait, perhaps t21 is part of a longer derivation. For example, NT6 \u2192 t67, t60, t43, t24, t77, etc. So, for example, if NT6 produces t24, which is a terminal, then perhaps t24 is in the string.\n\nIn the string, I see t24 as the sixth token: t21, t13, t40, t7, t23, t24.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So t24 is at position 6. So perhaps the first part of the string ends with t24, which may come from NT6's t24 production.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt21 (1), t13 (2), t40 (3), t7 (4), t23 (5), t24 (6), then t54 (7), t53 (8), t60 (9), t73 (10), t43 (11), t32 (12).\n\nWait, in NT6's productions, the terminal t24 is present.

{"custom_id":"request-211","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has certain characteristics: every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the given grammar, I can see that all the production rules have two non-terminals on the right-hand side or a single terminal. So that checks out.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the string `t28 t20 t77 t20 t12 t63 t44 t27 t26 t77 t54 t37`. Each token seems to be a terminal symbol, so the string is a sequence of terminals. The goal is to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for the start symbol. The start symbol in CNF is usually denoted by S. In the production rules, I see that S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is the only production starting with S. So the string must start with NT0 and NT4. Let me check the string: it starts with t28, which must correspond to NT0, and then t20, which must be NT4. Wait, but the string starts with t28 t20... According to the rules, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first two symbols must be NT0 and NT4. So t28 is NT0 and t20 is NT4.\n\nNow, I need to see how the string continues. Let me represent the string as a sequence of symbols: t28, t20, t77, t20, t12, t63, t44, t27, t26, t77, t54, t37.\n\nGiven that S \u2192 NT0 NT4, each step will generate these non-terminals, and I'll need to see if the entire sequence can be expanded correctly.\n\nLet me try to build a parse tree. Starting from S:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo the first two symbols should be NT0 and NT4. From the string, the first two symbols are t28 and t20. Let me check if t28 corresponds to NT0 and t20 to NT4. Looking at the production rules:\n\nFor NT0, I see that there are multiple rules. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 and NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7. But also, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 another time. Wait, I need to check which rules apply.\n\nLooking at the NT0 production:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- Also, there's NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, but maybe different indices? Wait, the rules are a bit complicated because some have higher indices, like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. Hmm, this might get confusing. I need to be careful with the rule indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to process the string step by step, expanding each non-terminal as needed.\n\nStarting with S, the first step is to expand S into NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols, t28 and t20, must be the heads of NT0 and NT4. From the grammar, I can check what NT0 and NT4 produce.\n\nLooking at NT0, one of its productions is NT0 \u2192 t28, because I see the rule NT0 \u2192 't28'. Similarly, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't20'. So that fits perfectly.\n\nSo NT0 \u2192 t28, and NT4 \u2192 t20. So the first two symbols must be t28 followed by t20. Which they are in the string.\n\nNow, since S has been expanded fully, the entire string should consist of the expansion of these two non-terminals.\n\nSo after S, the string should be exactly t28 t20. But wait, the string is longer than that, so there must be more non-terminals further down.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Actually, when you expand NT0 and NT4 further, they might themselves be non-terminals that need to be expanded into further symbols.\n\nSo let's look at NT0 and NT4.\n\nNT0 \u2192 t28 (a terminal). So that's done.\n\nNT4 \u2192 t20 (a terminal). That's done.\n\nSo the string should consist of t28 followed by t20, but the actual string has more than two symbols. Wait, no. Because the entire expansion of S is two terminals, so the string shouldn't be longer than that. But the given string is 12 symbols long, which is way more than two. That suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, in CNF, each production either terminates (A \u2192 a) or splits into two non-terminals (A \u2192 BC). So the string generated by S would be a sequence of terminals, each derived from the non-terminals in the productions.\n\nBut if the grammar has more non-terminals, the string could be longer than two symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step, expanding non-terminals as needed until all symbols are generated.\n\nSo the string is t28 t20 t77 t20 t12 t63 t44 t27 t26 t77 t54 t37.\n\nLet me index the string as positions 0 to 11.\n\nPosition 0: t28\n\nPosition 1: t20\n\nPosition 2: t77\n\nPosition 3: t20\n\nPosition 4: t12\n\nPosition 5: t63\n\nPosition 6: t44\n\nPosition 7: t27\n\nPosition 8: t26\n\nPosition 9: t77\n\nPosition 10: t54\n\nPosition 11: t37\n\nSo let's model the parsing process.\n\nInitially, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the lookahead is NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t28, which must be NT0 \u2192 t28. Then, we have t20, which must be NT4 \u2192 t20. So we can match the first two symbols: t28 and t20.\n\nNow, the remaining string is t77 t20 t12 t63 t44 t27 t26 t77 t54 t37.\n\nNow, next, I need to see what comes after NT0 and NT4. Wait, no. Once S is expanded into NT0 and NT4, which produce t28 and t20 respectively, there are no more symbols left in the string (since the input is only these two). But the remaining string is much longer, which suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the expansion works.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model this as a full parse, considering that NT0 and NT4 can themselves produce more non-terminals which need to be expanded.\n\nSo perhaps S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which then each of NT0 and NT4 can be expanded further. So the string should be the expansion of NT0 followed by the expansion of NT4.\n\nSo, for example, if NT0 \u2192 A B and NT4 \u2192 C D, then S \u2192 A B C D, which is four symbols. So if the string is four symbols matching this, it's valid.\n\nBut in our case, the string is twelve symbols long, so I need to see how the expansions can result in that.\n\nLet me look at the possible expansions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0 has several production rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (again?)\n\nWait, perhaps some of these rules are different but have the same index, so maybe duplicates. Or perhaps some are more specific.\n\nLooking carefully:\n\nNT0: (multiple rules)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (rule index 0)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (rule index 52)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (same as first)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9 (rule index 64)\nWait, no, looking again:\n\nLooking at the given grammar, let me list all the NT0 productions to make sure:\n\nFrom the provided grammar:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7 (rule 0)\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5 (rule 5)\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9 (rule 64)\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7 (rule 52)\nWait, I'm a bit confused because the rules are numbered from 0 to many, and some NT0 rules are duplicates in the list.\n\nLet me parse all the rules for NT0:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7 (line 0)\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7 (line 52)\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7 (line 64)\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9 (line 69)\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7 (line 77)\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5 (line 83)\n- NT0 -> NT2"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Hmm, this might take a while, but let's try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars are parsed using methods like CYK, but since it's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), maybe I can approach it by looking at the derivation tree. But wait, it's also in CNF, so each production has two non-terminals or a terminal. I'll need to reconstruct possible sequences that match the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S. The first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So any string derived from S should start with NT0 and NT4. Let's check the string: the first token is t37. I need to see if NT0 can produce t37 or if NT4 can produce t37.\n\nLooking through the rules, I find NT0 has several productions, one of which is NT0 \u2192 t23. NT4 has rule NT4 \u2192 t32 as well. So t37 isn't directly produced by either NT0 or NT4. Wait, that might be a problem. Unless there are more steps. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT0 and NT4 can be built through a series of productions. Let's look deeper. NT0 can produce NT9 NT7 in some cases, but not directly t37. NT4 has a production to NT5 NT2, but t37 isn't in there. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake. Wait, looking again, there's a production NT5 \u2192 t27, but where does NT5 lead?\n\nWait another approach: since the string starts with t37, that must come from a production of NT0 or NT4. Let's check NT0's rules again. Oh, I see NT0 has a rule that goes to t74, another that goes to t23, but no t37. Wait, looking through all NT0 productions:\n\nLooking again: The NT0 rules include NT0 -> NT5 NT5, NT0 -> NT9 NT7, NT0 -> NT9 NT7 (duplicate), NT0 -> NT6 NT7 (another rule), maybe I missed t37.\n\nWait, checking all rules, I don't see any NT0 that produces t37. Similarly, checking NT4 rules: do any of them produce t37? Scanning the rules, NT4 has rules like NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, but none directly produce t37. Hmm, that's a problem because the first token is t37, which doesn't appear directly on either NT0 or NT4's initial productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a rule. Let me list all possible NT0 and NT4 productions. Starting with NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n... etc.\n\nDo any of these NT0 or NT4 nodes produce t37? Not directly. So maybe t37 comes from a deeper production. For example, NT0 could expand into NT6 NT7, and then NT6 and NT7 could expand further to produce t37 somewhere in the chain.\n\nLooking at NT6: NT6 can go to NT7 NT9. Then, NT7s could produce t54 or other terminals. Wait, let's see the rules for NT7:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0 and some others, but none produce t37. So that path might not lead to t37.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the string starts with t37, which doesn't correspond to either NT0 or NT4 on the first level, so perhaps the string isn't generated by this grammar. But that can't be right because maybe some chain of productions leads to t37.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT4 can lead to a string where the first part is t37 from NT0. But if that's not possible, then the string can't be generated. Alternatively, maybe the string is interleaved in a way that the first two symbols are part of the same NT0 or NT4 expansion.\n\nWait, considering that in the string, the first token is t37, which isn't directly produced by NT0 or NT4, but the problem is that S starts with NT0 NT4, so the first token must come from either NT0 or NT4. If neither NT0 nor NT4 can produce t37 directly, then the string can't be derived from S, hence it's 'No'. But let me double-check because maybe I missed a rule.\n\nLooking through the grammar again:\n\nFor NT0, all its expansions either combine two NTs or end with some t. The only explicit terminals for NT0 are like t23, t74, etc., but no t37.\n\nSimilarly, NT4's expansions give t32, t51, etc., but no t37. So none of the initial symbols of NT0 or NT4 produce t37. Therefore, the string can't be generated because the first token t37 can't be derived from NT0 or NT4.\n\nWait, unless I'm misunderstanding the order. Because the grammar might allow for the production to combine in a way that t37 is produced as part of a longer chain. But since the first token is t37, and it can't be produced by the first NT0 or NT4, the entire string can't be generated.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t13 t27 t14 t42 t43 t10 t14 t77 t76 t70 t7 t76 t8`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. CNF is a specific form where each production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it starts with S and has rules leading down to terminals like 't13', 't27', etc. My goal is to parse the string step by step to see if it can be formed by the grammar.\n\nThe string consists of multiple 't's followed by numbers, which are likely terminals in the grammar. Each non-terminal in the grammar can be expanded into pairs of other non-terminals or terminals. So, the approach would be to see if the string can be derived by expanding S step by step until all non-terminals are resolved to terminals.\n\nI'll start by looking at the initial production: S -> NT0 NT4. So the string should start with NT0 and NT4. Let me check the string: the first symbols are t13, t27, t14, t42, t43, t10, t14, t77, t76, t70, t7, t76, t8. Wait, S is generating NT0 and NT4. So the first part should be NT0, then NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is t13. Let's check if NT0 can produce t13. Looking through the grammar rules for NT0, I see NT0 -> NT5 NT5. But 't13' is listed under NT7 as NT7 -> t13, not NT0. So maybe I need to go deeper.\n\nWait, let's see the expansion of NT0. In the grammar, NT0 has multiple rules: NT0 -> NT6 NT7, NT0 -> NT9 NT7, etc. So I think I need to track how each non-terminal can derive to the terminals.\n\nLet me approach this by breaking down the string into components that could be produced by the grammar. The string has multiple 't's, so each must come from some terminal production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into a sequence of production steps starting from S. Let me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t13 t27 t14 t42 t43 t10 t14 t77 t76 t70 t7 t76 t8.\n\nBreaking it down into individual symbols for easier handling: ['t13', 't27', 't14', 't42', 't43', 't10', 't14', 't77', 't76', 't70', 't7', 't76', 't8'].\n\nNow, starting from S, which is NT0 and NT4.\n\nFirst, NT0: Let's see what NT0 can produce. From the grammar, NT0 has several production rules, for example, NT0 -> NT6 NT7, NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc. But the first symbol is t13, which is produced by NT7. So perhaps NT0 must be expanded further to reach t13.\n\nWait, but T0 is a non-terminal, so it can only produce other non-terminals or terminals. Let's think recursively.\n\nIf the string starts with t13, which is produced by NT7. So how can NT0 reach t13? Let's look at the production rules of NT0. For example, NT0 can be expanded as NT6 NT7. Then, each of those can be expanded further.\n\nWait, this might get complicated, but let me try to map this step by step. Let me outline the possible expansions.\n\n1. S starts with NT0 and NT4, so the first two symbols are from NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nLooking at the string: the first symbol is t13, which is NT7. So NT0 must derive to t13. But looking at NT0's production rules, none directly produce t13. So perhaps there's a chain of expansions.\n\nLooking at NT0's first production: NT0 -> NT6 NT7. So NT0 would expand into NT6 and NT7. Now, each of these can be further expanded.\n\nLooking at NT6's production rules: NT6 can produce NT7 NT9, NT0 NT2, etc. Since the second symbol is t27, which is from NT5 (NT5 -> t5?), wait, actually, looking back, NT4 can produce t42, which is t42-> it's 't42' in the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model the string as a sequence of variables that must derive step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using memoization or recursive descent parsing.\n\nWait, another thought: all the terminals are single characters, but in the grammar, some non-terminals produce terminals. But sometimes, in practice, each production can have only one terminal, but according to CNF, each production is at most two non-terminals. So maybe each production leads to a specific terminal.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, each rule is either a production to two non-terminals or a terminal. However, in the given grammar, all NT0, NT1, etc., are non-terminals, and each have productions that lead to combinations of other non-terminals or possibly a terminal.\n\nBut looking at the ending productions: for example, NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't33', etc. So each of these has a production to a single terminal, which fits the terminal symbols.\n\nSo, the strings are sequences of terminals that should be generated by the grammar, and each terminal corresponds to some NT rule.\n\nFirst, let me map each terminal to its possible non-terminal source:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't76' (NT3 has multiple rules, but 't76' is one of them)\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n- NT5 -> 't47' etc.\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- Also, looking for each terminal as a single symbol: for example, 't13' is from NT7, 't27' from NT5, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the entire string as a list that needs to be parsed from the grammar, starting from S.\n\nBut with the given complexity of the grammar, this might be time-consuming. Instead, perhaps we can check each symbol in the string to see if it's accounted for by the starting rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be split into segments that each are derived from the grammar.\n\nAnother approach: the initial production is S -> NT0 NT4. So the string must start with NT0 and then NT4. So the first two symbols should correspond to NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nBut looking at the string: first symbol is t13 (NT7) and second is t27 (NT5). So, if the first symbol should be from NT0, but here it's NT7, which is different. Therefore, this suggests that the string cannot be generated by this grammar, because the first symbol t13 is not from NT0.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Maybe the productions allow for NT0 to produce a terminal, but from the grammar, all of NT0's productions are to two non-terminals except NT0 -> 't23', etc. Wait, looking at the grammar, the productions for NT0 include NT6 NT7, NT9 NT6, etc., but not directly to a terminal except in some cases.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar again:\n\nLooking for a production that is NT0 -> 't23'. Yes, there's \"NT0 -> 't23'\". So 't23' can be directly produced by NT0.\n\nSimilarly, 't13' is produced by NT7 (since NT7 -> 't13'), 't27' is produced by NT5, etc.\n\nSo the first symbol t13 is from NT7, which means that in the expansion starting from S, we would have NT0 producing t13, which isn't possible because NT0's first expansion is to non-terminals. Therefore, the initial assumption that S starts with NT0 and NT4 is correct, but in the string, the first symbol is t13, which is from NT7, not NT0. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to have an intermediate expansion where NT0 somehow produces NT7 and so on. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules: for example, NT0 can become NT6 NT7, which would give us NT6 and NT7. Now, suppose NT6 expands to 't83' (a terminal), and NT7 expands to 't13"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Terminals are the base elements, like 't' followed by numbers. The goal is to see if starting from the start symbol S, we can derive the given string through a series of productions.\n\nThe grammar starts with S -> NT0 NT4. So, the string must be a concatenation of two parts generated by NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nLooking at the string, I notice it's in the order t11, t12, t33, t3, t47, t5, t24, t72, t26, t76, t60, t56, t56, t83. I think I need to parse this string into the non-terminals and see if each part can be derived from NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, no, actually, the grammar allows terminals to be directly expanded. Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so they must match the expansions of the non-terminals NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, they eventually expand into sequences of terminals. For example, NT0 could go to NT6 NT7, then NT6 might go to NT9 NT8, and so on until it produces something like 't28' or other terminals.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 likely expands into a series of terminals. Looking at the productions, NT4 can go to NT8 NT6, then each of those can break down further until terminals are reached.\n\nI think the approach is to build a parse tree for the given string, starting from S, and see if each non-terminal can generate the corresponding sequence of terminals.\n\nBut parsing directly might be complicated. Maybe I can break the string into two parts, the first generated by NT0 and the second by NT4. Or perhaps the order depends on the structure of the grammar.\n\nWait, since each production splits into two, the string must be a concatenation of two parts. So the first part corresponds to NT0's expansion, and the second part to NT4's expansion.\n\nLooking at the string, the last part is t56 t56 t83. Maybe that's generated by NT6, since I see some t56's in NT6's productions. NT6 can go to NT7 NT9, or other paths, but ultimately, let's see what it can produce.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since each non-terminal eventually expands into a sequence of terminals, I can try to trace each terminal back to its originating non-terminal.\n\nEach terminal like 't11' must come from some production. For example, looking through the grammar, I notice 't11' appears in NT6's productions, like NT6 -> NT8 NT0, which can lead to 't11' if NT6 expands that way.\n\nBut let me think step-by-step.\n\nThe string is t11 t12 ... t83. Maybe I can look at the entire string and see if it can be generated by S.\n\nWait, another approach: for each terminal in the string, find the possible non-terminal that can produce it directly. Then, check the grammar to see if the sequence can be built.\n\nBut looking at the grammar, every production is an expansion of a non-terminal into two other non-terminals. Terminals are the leaves. So each terminal must directly appear in a production as part of the right-hand side.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that several non-terminals expand into pairs that eventually produce terminals.\n\nFor example, NT4 can expand into 't37' or other terminals through a chain of productions. Similarly, NT5 can produce 't53', and so on.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal, and whether the parsing can be done.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for the start symbols and see if the string can be divided into parts starting with S.\n\nS is NT0 NT4. So, the string must be the concatenation of what NT0 produces and what NT4 produces.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps the first part is generated by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts, say, the first n tokens for NT0 and the rest for NT4.\n\nBut the string is 14 tokens long. Each production adds exactly one non-terminal on either side. Maybe each non-terminal in the grammar can be associated with a certain number of terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be generated by finding a path through the grammar that matches each token.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal is reachable in the grammar.\n\nWait, looking at NT6, it can produce 't83', 't28', 't56', etc. Similarly, NT5 can produce 't47', 't37', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, t11 is produced by NT6, t12 by NT6, t33 by NT5, t3 by NT3, t47 by NT5, t5 by NT5, t24 by NT9, t72 by NT3, t26 by NT3, t76 by NT2, t60 by NT3, t56 by NT6, t56 again by NT6, and t83 by NT6.\n\nWait, wait. So t11, t12, t33, t3, t47, etc., each correspond to specific non-terminals. So the entire string is a concatenation of these.\n\nSo the first part, t11, t12, t33, maybe comes from NT0, and the rest comes from NT4.\n\nBut let me think: NT0 can go to NT6 NT7. NT6 can go to NT8 NT0, which can continue until terminals are reached. NT7 can go to NT4 NT0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 can go to NT8 NT6, and then those can break down.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should pick the first few tokens and see if they can be generated by NT0.\n\nTaking t11 t12 t33 as part of NT0's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions, there's NT6 -> NT7 NT9, which eventually can produce t11. Similarly, NT7 can produce t47 or t33.\n\nWait, maybe NT6 can produce t11, t12, etc.\n\nI think this is getting too detailed. Maybe a better approach is to recognize that each symbol in the string corresponds to a non-terminal's production path.\n\nIf I can find a way to parse the string backward, matching each terminal to the non-terminal it's produced by, then checking if the sequence can be built.\n\nLooking at the string: t11 t12 t33 t3 t47 t5 t24 t72 t26 t76 t60 t56 t56 t83.\n\nI think t56 appears twice, which could come from NT6 producing it twice.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- t11: from NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n  NT7 -> t47 or NT4 NT0\n  NT9 -> t56\n  So t11 is from NT6 -> NT7 (which is NT4 NT0) and NT9 (t56). So that would be NT7, which is NT4 NT0. So from NT7, which is NT6 NT9.\n\n- t12: need to find a production that expands into t12.\nLooking through the grammar, maybe NT6 can produce t12 through some steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe NT4 can produce t12. Let me check NT4's productions.\n\nNT4 can go to NT8 NT6. Then NT8 can go to NT5 NT3, etc.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe the answer is 'Yes' because all the terminals can be associated with non-terminals that have production rules leading to them.

The string is: `t79 t8 t69 t43 t26 t2 t83 t43 t8 t70 t23 t57 t35 t70`.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for possibly the start symbol. However, looking at the rules, I see that some start with 't' like NT2 -> 't14'. So the start symbol S must ultimately derive a string of terminals. \n\nEach production step reduces the number of non-terminals until we reach terminals. The goal is to parse the given string backward from S, applying the rules to see if the entire string can be produced.\n\nThe string has 14 tokens, all starting with 't', so it's a sequence of terminal symbols. Let's list them in reverse order to work backward, as in reverse engineering:\n\nt70 (last token), t35, t70, t57, t8, ... starting from the end.\n\nLet's look at the last token, t70. I need to find a production rule that produces t70. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking at NT8 -> NT5 NT3. Wait, but wait, in the rules, NT5 -> 't47' and NT3 -> 't72', so NT8 -> 't47' 't72' = t4772? No, that's not matching. Let me check.\n\nWait, some rules produce 't' followed by a number. Like NT3 -> 't72', so when NT3 is used, it becomes 't72'. Similarly, NT8 -> 't5' might not be correct. Wait, let me look again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see entries like NT7 -> 't13', NT3 -> 't72', etc. Let's get all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT2 -> 't14'\n- NT9 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT8 -> 't21'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT5 -> 't33' (another one)\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT8 -> 't81'\n- NT4 -> 't9'\n- NT6 -> 't77'\n- NT6 -> 't43' (duplicate)\n- NT3 -> 't51'\n- NT8 -> 't84'\n- NT7 -> 't76'\n- NT6 -> 't61'\n- NT2 -> 't53'\n- NT3 -> 't24'\n- NT9 -> 't44'\n- NT5 -> 't15'\n- NT7 -> 't33'\n- NT8 -> 't64'\n- NT6 -> 't77' (duplicate)\n- NT6 -> 't43' (another)\n- NT7 -> 't76' (duplicate)\n- NT8 -> 't56'\n- NT3 -> 't2' (duplicate)\n- NT8 -> 't73'\n- NT7 -> 't76' (duplicate)\n- NT6 -> 't61'\n- NT2 -> 't63'\n- NT9 -> 't79'\n- NT8 -> 't57'\n- NT3 -> 't8'\n- NT7 -> 't17'\n- NT4 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't10'\n- NT0 -> 't52'\n- NT7 -> 't70' (duplicate)\n- NT6 -> 't11'\n- NT0 -> 't35'\n- NT6 -> 't67'\n- NT8 -> 't77'\n- NT4 -> 't42'\n\nWait, some of these might be duplicates or different variations. Now, each 't' followed by a number corresponds to a production. So, for example, NT3 -> 't72' means that when NT3 is used, it produces 't72'.\n\nThe string to parse is: t79 t8 t69 t43 t26 t2 t83 t43 t8 t70 t23 t57 t35 t70.\n\nLet's try to match from the end. The last token is t70. So, I need to find a production that results in 't70'. Looking through the terminal rules:\n\nLooking for NT that produces t70. Let's scan:\n\n- NT0 -> 't74' is not matching\n- NT4 -> 't42' is not.\n- Wait, no. Looking for 't70' in the rules. Do any production have 't70' as their terminal?\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, I don't see any rule directly producing 't70'. Let me check the rules again. Hmm, perhaps I missed it. Let me check each rule:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any rule directly producing t70. The closest is NT8 -> 't81', t57, t64, etc. So, perhaps t70 is produced by a non-terminal, and then I need to break that down further.\n\nSo, the last token is t70. That must come from a non-terminal NT that has a production resulting in 't70'. Since I don't see any production for t70 as a terminal, it must be generated by a non-terminal NT that can produce a string ending with 't70'.\n\nSo, let's find which non-terminal can produce a string that ends with 't70' and see if it can be part of a larger tree.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT2 -> 't14' is terminal, so it can't be the cause. Let's see:\n\nLooking for any production that can derive 't70'. Hmm, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT8 -> 't21', 't81', 't56'\n\nWait, perhaps one of these can be combined to generate t70.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a non-terminal can produce a combination of terminals. For example, if a rule outputs t57 and t13, that could form 't57t13', which is t5713, but that doesn't end with t70.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a non-terminal can produce 't70' through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial non-terminal S can produce the string. Let's try to see what S produces.\n\nThe start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, S produces two non-terminals: NT0 and NT4. Each must be expanded into a string of terminals.\n\nSo, to generate the string, both NT0 and NT4 must derive parts of the string that, when combined, form the given string.\n\nSo, perhaps the given string is formed by expanding NT0 and NT4 in such a way that the concatenation of NT0's expansion and NT4's expansion equals the given string.\n\nGiven that, let's split the string into two parts, but without knowing the split point, it's tricky. But perhaps the string can be divided into two parts, each generated by NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nThe given string is: [t79, t8, t69, t43, t26, t2, t83, t43, t8, t70, t23, t57, t35, t70].\n\nThat's 14 tokens. So, potentially, the NT0 could produce the first k tokens, and NT4 could produce the remaining (14 - k) tokens, for some k.\n\nBut without knowing the split, maybe it's better to approach this by trying to find which non-terminals can produce sequences that include t70, t71, etc., but without any direct t70 in the terminal rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t70 is a result of concatenating two terminal symbols, such as 't7' and 't0', which is t70.\n\nWait, but looking through the terminal rules, I see NT8 -> 't21', NT8 -> 't57', etc. Let me see if any non-terminal's production can result in 't1' or 't7' followed by another symbol.\n\nLooking for non-terminals that, when expanded, can produce 't7' at some point.\n\nFor example, NT8 -> 't57' which is 't57' as a single token.

{"custom_id":"request-271","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the string `t62 t21 t27 t27 t8 t23 t57 t15 t14 t60 t33 t23 t60 t51 t83` is generated by the given context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form. Hmm, this looks a bit intimidating because the grammar is quite complex with many production rules. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Chomsky normal form (CNF), each production is either a single terminal symbol or two non-terminals. The given grammar follows CNF since all the left-hand sides (LHS) are single symbols, and the right-hand sides (RHS) consist of two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, so I need to see if this can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules. Let me see how the string starts: it's `t62`, `t21`, `t27`, etc. I notice that some of these are two-digit numbers, but in the grammar, variables like NT0, NT1, etc., expand into sequences of terminals. So each 't' followed by a number is likely a terminal resulting from expanding a non-terminal.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string using the grammar. Parsing can be done with methods like CYK or recursive descent, but since the grammar is given, maybe I can simplify the process by looking for patterns or checking which non-terminals can produce the necessary terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: it's 15 tokens. Let me see what the start symbol can produce. The start symbol S -> NT0 NT4. So the string must derive from NT0 and NT4 somehow. Let me check if the string can be split into parts that correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, but in the string, there are 15 terms. Each production in CNF adds two symbols, so the length of the derivation might help. Let me calculate the number of steps. Starting from S (1 symbol), each production step doubles the length (assuming binary branching). But the string length is 15, which is odd. Hmm, that might not apply because some productions might lead to more than one symbol, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on parsing.\n\nLet me see if I can parse the string from left to right. Alternatively, perhaps reconstruct the parse tree.\n\nLet me list the rules that produce 't62', 't21', etc. I'll check which non-terminals can produce each terminal or a sequence leading to each terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, some non-terminals have rules that can lead to specific terminals. For example:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' (among others). So NT0 can produce 't23' directly.\n- NT4 -> 't37' directly.\n- NT5 -> 't10' and other terminals.\n- NT3 -> 't2' etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is 't62'. Let me check which non-terminals can produce 't62'. Scanning the grammar, I see:\n\nLooking through the production rules, I see NT0 -> 't62' appears multiple times. So NT0 can directly produce 't62'.\n\nNext, 't21' is in the string. Looking for NT's that produce 't21'. Checking the grammar, I see NT8 -> 't21' directly. So NT8 can produce 't21'.\n\nThen 't27'. Looking for NT's that produce 't27': checking the grammar, NT5 -> 't27' directly. So NT5 can produce 't27'.\n\nAnother 't27' again: same as before, NT5 \u2192 't27'.\n\nNext is 't8'. Looking for NTs that can produce 't8': in the grammar, NT2 -> 't7' and others. Wait, no, looking again, I see NT9 -> 't83', which is not 't8'. Wait, maybe checking the production where NT7 \u2192 't8' directly? Let me verify: looking at NT rules, yes, I see NT7 -> 't8' (under NT7 productions: two 't8's, one 't7'). So NT7 can produce 't8'.\n\nSo far, the string is divided into: t62 (NT0), t21 (NT8), t27 (NT5), t27 (NT5), t8 (NT7).\n\nWait, but where does NT7 come from? Let me see the initial S production is NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be produced by NT0 and NT4. Let me try to see how these two can combine.\n\nBut let me see the parts step by step. Let me try to construct the initial symbols:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo the entire string must be a combination of NT0 (which might produce several terminals) followed by NT4 (which might produce several terminals). But wait, the string is a single sequence; perhaps the two parts can interleave or something. Alternatively, maybe I should parse the string as a single non-terminal, but that doesn\u2019t fit because in the current S, it's split into two.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider that the string must be split into two parts, one produced by NT0 and the other by NT4. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nBut wait, the string is 15 tokens, so if NT0 produces a, and NT4 produces b, then a and b are interleaved somehow? No, in the grammar, each production step is a binary split, so maybe the string can be divided into sequences that correspond to the left and right parts of the initial split.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be viewed as a combination of the expansions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me try to see: the first part is 't62 t21 t27 t27 t8' and the second part is 't23 t60 t33 t23 t60 t51 t83'. Maybe each part comes from NT0 and NT4 respectively.\n\nLet me check if 't62 t21 t27 t27 t8' can be derived from NT0 and whether 't23 t60 t33 t23 t60 t51 t83' can be derived from NT4.\n\nStarting with NT0:\n\n- t62: as above, directly from NT0.\n- Next token: t21 from NT8.\nBut wait, NT0 expands into something, not NT8 directly. Hmm. Maybe I'm complicating things.\n\nPerhaps I should construct the parse tree step by step. Let me see.\n\nThe first token is 't62' which comes from NT0. Then the second token is 't21' which comes from NT8. But wait, in the initial rule S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the derivation starts with NT0 followed by NT4. So the first token is from NT0, the next from NT4. But in the string, after 't62' comes 't21', which would be part of the NT4 expansion.\n\nBut wait, that might not fit because the initial S split is NT0 and NT4. So the entire string must be a result of the expansions of NT0 and NT4 interleaved in some way, but perhaps not necessarily in order.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently by looking for the entire string as a possible derivation from S.\n\nWait, another approach: since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and each non-terminal can produce terminals and non-terminals, perhaps I can look at the string as a combination of the expansions of NT0 and NT4, each leading to sequences that when interleaved give the string.\n\nBut that's complicated because we have to interleave two separate expansions. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be generated step by step by applying productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can be divided into two parts, each being a valid expansion from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nLooking at the first few tokens:\n\nt62 t21 t27 t27 t8\n\nFrom the grammar:\n\n- t62 comes from NT0.\n\nNext, t21 is from NT8.\n\nThen, t27 comes from NT5.\n\nAnother t27 from NT5.\n\nt8 from NT7.\n\nNow, looking at the production rules:\n\nNT0's production includes NT6 and NT7, among others. Wait, no, NT0's production in some rules is NT6 NT7, but in others, NT0 is a terminal sometimes.\n\nWait, but the string is a flat list of terminals.

{"custom_id":"request-273","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I need to check is `t62 t77 t57 t35 t35 t80 t80 t77 t62 t70 t61 t33 t62 t53 t9`. \n\nHmm, first, I should recall what CNF entails. CNF grammars have productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and the start symbol can be a non-terminal that can produce terminals directly. Also, in CNF, all right-hand sides (RHS) of productions consist of exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that each production seems to break down into two non-terminals only. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So that fits the CNF structure. That's a good start.\n\nNow, the string has a lot of symbols: t62, t77, etc. Since the grammar is in CNF, the derivation of the string must go through sequences of productions where each step generates exactly two non-terminals, except for the terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to try to parse the string step by step, starting from the start symbol S and trying to derive the string by breaking it down into smaller parts, each time expanding non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nThe string is: t62 t77 t57 t35 t35 t80 t80 t77 t62 t70 t61 t33 t62 t53 t9. \n\nThat's 15 symbols, all terminals, which are t followed by numbers, except perhaps some are multi-character like t12, t23, etc. Wait, looking closer, the terminals are all single t followed by two digits: t62, t77, t57, etc. So each is a single token, each consisting of 't' and a two-digit number.\n\nSo each terminal is a single production. Now, the CFG will consist of a series of such terminals, generated through the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI think the way to approach this is to construct a parse tree starting from S, expanding non-terminals into two non-terminals, and seeing if we can end up with the given string.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can simulate a bottom-up parsing approach, like the CYK algorithm. But maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, since each step of the grammar's production is exactly two non-terminals, except perhaps for when the string's symbols are terminals, I can try to see if the string can be broken down into the production rules given.\n\nLet me start by examining the structure of the string. It has 15 symbols, which is an odd number. Since each production (except maybe the start) produces two non-terminals, the number of symbols in a derived string should be 2^n - 1. For example, S \u2192 NT1 NT2 \u2192 symbols 1 + (NT1 and NT2 each expand). Wait, each application of a production replaces one non-terminal with two, so the length of the string increases by one each time.\n\nWait, let's think about it: if you have a non-terminal A, which can be A \u2192 B C, then each expansion doubles the number of symbols, but considering that each non-terminal can have multiple children, it's a bit tricky. Actually, perhaps a better approach is to see how the number of symbols grows with each step.\n\nBut maybe that's not the best way. Let me think about the structure. Since each production in CNF only adds one new element each time (since two non-terminals replace one), the number of symbols should be 1 (start) plus, each time a production is applied, it adds one more symbol. So the total number of symbols is n, and the depth is log n or something, but maybe it's not crucial here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for patterns or certain sequences that might indicate whether the grammar can generate this string.\n\nLooking at the string, let's see if some of the terminals appear in specific production chains. For example, t62 appears multiple times. Let me check the productions involving NT0, NT2, etc.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 and NT7 have t62 and t5 in their productions? Wait, no, looking at the provided productions:\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT8 NT0\nNT2 -> NT7 NT2\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\nNT5 -> NT7 NT3\nNT5 -> NT7 NT2\nNT5 -> NT3 NT3\nWait, no, this is getting complicated. Let me look for any known sequences or links.\n\nWait, I can see that NT0 is derived into NT6 and NT7. Maybe I can look for t62 t77 t57 etc. Let me see if any of these pairs correspond to a production.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7. \n\nSo NT0 could expand into NT6 and NT7. If I have a t62, perhaps NT6 could produce t62 and something else. Looking at NT6's productions:\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nIn the grammar, for example:\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT8 NT0\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\nAnd others? Wait, looking at the provided list:\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9 \nNT6 -> NT8 NT0 \nNT6 -> NT6 NT0 \nWait, in the grammar, looking at the entries like:\n\n\"NT6 -> NT7 NT9\" (appears twice)\n\"NT6 -> NT8 NT0\" (appears twice)\n\"NT6 -> NT6 NT0\" (appears multiple times)\n\"NT6 -> NT7 NT0\" (appears twice)\n\"NT6 -> NT6 NT2\" (appears twice)\n\"NT6 -> NT7 NT9\" (again multiple times)\n\nAnd similar others. \n\nLooking at the productions of NT6, for example:\n\nNT6 can produce NT7 NT9, which might result in t62 and t77? Let me check: Yes, NT6 -> t62 and NT9. Wait, looking at NT9's productions:\n\nLooking through the grammar, for example:\n\n\"NT9 -> 't43'\", so that's a terminal.\n\nWait, looking for NT9 in the productions:\n\nIn the grammar, NT9's are in multiple places, and in the end, they eventually go into terminals like 't43', 't20', etc.\n\nWait, but when NT6 expands into NT7 and NT9, perhaps NT7 can expand into NT4 and NT0, and NT9 into a terminal.\n\nFor example, in the given string, we have t62 t77 t57... So perhaps NT6 (t62) expands into NT7 (t77) and NT9. Then NT7 might produce t77 and something else. Let me check NT7's productions:\n\nNT7 can produce NT4 NT0 or NT4 NT6.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT7: \n\nYes, NT7 -> NT4 NT0 and NT7 -> NT4 NT6.\n\nIn the string, after t62 is t77, which could be NT7 producing t77. Then, the next is t57, which could be NT7 producing another t77 and something else.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should approach this step-by-step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string from left to right, trying to match the productions.\n\nThe string is:\n\nt62 t77 t57 t35 t35 t80 t80 t77 t62 t70 t61 t33 t62 t53 t9.\n\nThat's 15 symbols, so the parse tree must have 15 leaves, which suggests that it's (2^4 -1)=15, so 4 levels, meaning that the depth of the tree is 4 steps of expansion from S.\n\nBut perhaps that's too detailed. Alternatively, let's think in terms of possible leftmost derivation.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols should correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string: first symbol is t62. Let's see if NT0 can produce t62.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, or NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, or NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc.\n\nWait, looking back, in the productions:\n\nNT0 can produce NT9 NT7, which are both non-terminals. From the earlier point, NT9 can produce t43, which is a terminal, and NT7 can produce t77.\n\nWait, but the first symbol in the string is t62. So perhaps NT0 can produce a terminal t62.

{"custom_id":"request-299","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form, and I need to determine if the string `t60 t62 t39 t62 t24 t70 t67 t53 t63 t63 t61 t69 t53 t53 t7 t37` is generated by this grammar. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a way to write context-free grammars where each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, I can see that all the productions except for some like NTx -> 'txx' or directly to terminals like 't's are either of the form X \u2192 YZ where Y and Z are non-terminals. Wait, actually, some of them have non-terminals like NT0 -> NT6 NT7, which are combinations, so that fits the CNF rule.\n\nNow, the string given consists of a sequence of terminals. My task is to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S through a series of productions. So, the approach would be to try to parse the string from left to right using the grammar, checking at each step if we can match any production.\n\nLet me look at the grammar rules. The start symbol is S. S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first two symbols must be derived from NT0 and NT4. Let me look at the string: the first two tokens are t60 and t62. Hmm, I need to see if t60 can be derived from NT0, and t62 from NT4.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see NT0 has several productions. One of them is NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, another is NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and some others. Let me see if I can find a path that leads to t60.\n\nWait, under NT0, the productions include things like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and in the rules, NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, etc. But in the string, the first symbol is t60. Let me check the rules for NT0. Also, at the bottom of the NT0 rules, there are rules like NT0 -> NT5 NT5, NT0 -> NT4 NT4, etc. Wait, I'm noticing that in the rules, some NTx have specific terminal assignments. For example, NT0 is in the rule NT0 \u2192 't23'.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see some like:\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n\nSo these non-terminals can be directly replaced by certain terminal strings. So for instance, NT9 \u2192 't60', which would produce the terminal 't60'. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't23', which would produce t23. So in the string, we have t60 first. That suggests that the first part of the string is derived from NT9, because NT9 \u2192 t60.\n\nWait, but the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so S is split into two parts: NT0 and NT4. Let's consider the string: the first token is t60, which would come from NT0. So how is t60 generated? From the rules I saw, NT9 -> t60, but how does that connect to NT0?\n\nLooking at the rules, NT0 can go to NT6 NT7, etc. But how do these non-terminals connect to t60? Maybe the parsing isn't straightforward, but perhaps there's a way that the combination leads to t60.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's look at the string again: `t60 t62 t39 t62 t24 t70 t67 t53 t63 t63 t61 t69 t53 t53 t7 t37`. That's a sequence of 15 tokens.\n\nStarting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so we need to expand NT0 and NT4 into the first two symbols, t60 and t62. So NT0 must produce t60, and NT4 must produce t62.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules, NT0 has a production that leads to 't23', which is t23. But here, the first symbol is t60, so perhaps the initial production isn't directly that. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the NT0 and NT4 can themselves be expanded through non-terminals that eventually produce the terminals in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial expansion isn't direct; for example, NT0 might expand to NT6 NT7, which then expand further until terminals are reached.\n\nBut in that case, how can we get t60 as the first symbol? Let me look for the non-terminals that can produce t60. Looking through the rules, I see that NT9 \u2192 t60. So maybe one of the non-terminals in NT0's expansion is NT9, and when it's expanded, it becomes t60.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT0 NT5\nNT0 -> NT9 NT3\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT7 -> NT7 NT0\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT7 -> NT4 NT3\n...\nOther rules include NT0 -> 't23' and NT9 -> 't60' and others.\n\nWait, so if NT0 is expanded to NT6 NT7, and if NT6 can produce t60, but looking at NT6's rules: NT6 has many productions. For example, NT6 -> NT7 NT9, and also NT6 -> NT6 NT0, which implies recursion. But looking for NT6 \u2192 't' terminals, I see NT6 \u2192 't83' and NT6 \u2192 't67' (wait, no, checking the rules: NT6 has a production to 't83' but does it have a direct t60? No, looking through the rules, I see NT9 -> 't60', but NT6 doesn't have any terminal production except perhaps in some other rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look through all the NTx rules to see which can produce terminals.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n\nSo only these non-terminals can directly produce terminals: NT2, NT3, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT0, and NT9.\n\nBut for the first symbol, t60 is in the string. That comes from NT9. So how does t60 fit into NT0?\n\nBecause the string starts with t60, which comes from NT9. So perhaps in the expansion of NT0, one of the non-terminals becomes NT9, and then that's how t60 is produced.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the expansion must start with NT0 generating t60, and NT4 generating t62.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, one of them is NT0 -> NT9 NT7. So if NT0 is split into NT9 and NT7, then NT9 would produce t60. So perhaps the expansion starts with NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7.\n\nThen NT9 \u2192 t60, and NT7 needs to produce the next symbols in the string after t60. The next token is t62. So let's see what NT7 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT7's rules:\n\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT3\n- etc.\n\nNone of these directly produce t62. Hmm. That seems problematic.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe the production of NT0 doesn't involve NT9 for the first t60, but perhaps a different path. Alternatively, maybe NT0 is expanded further before any terminals are produced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that NT0 can expand into other non-terminals that eventually produce t60 in the string.\n\nWait, maybe I should model this as a parsing problem, trying to see if each step in the string can be matched by the grammar.\n\nLet's try to parse step by step.\n\nThe string is: t60 t62 t39 t62 t24 t70 t67 t53 t63 t63 t61 t69 t53 t53 t7 t37."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-312","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t40 t79 t28 t53 t67 t27 t15 t51 t83 t70 t63 t83 t60 t70 t52 t79 t76`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has specific structure where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Our grammar's productions fit this since each S, NT0, etc., are non-terminals and the terminals are like t40, t79, etc.\n\nThe task is to parse the string or to check if the grammar can generate it. Since the grammar is quite complex, I think the best way is to perform a top-down parsing, maybe using the CYK algorithm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I could try to see if each symbol in the string can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the grammar more closely. The start symbol is S, which initially produces NT0 NT4. So the first step should be to split the string into parts that can be derived from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string: `t40 t79 t28 t53 t67 t27 t15 t51 t83 t70 t63 t83 t60 t70 t52 t79 t76`\n\nSince the string is a series of symbols separated by spaces, each represents a terminal. So the first symbol is 't40', the second 't79', etc. So the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 must generate these symbols in order.\n\nSo NT0 should derive the first part, and NT4 the second part. Let's split the string accordingly. But how? Because the order is such that the left part is from NT0 and the right part from NT4. So the entire string should be the concatenation of the derivations of NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut the string has 17 symbols, so maybe NT0 generates the first k symbols and NT4 the remaining 17 -k. But I don't know what k is. That seems tricky. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the order in which the terminals appear and see if any of the productions can match. For example, some terminals might start a production chain, and I can see if following that chain leads to a complete coverage of the string.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't40'. Looking at the grammar, NT0 has a production to 't23' (see the rule: NT0 \u2192 't23'). But earlier, I see that NT0 has multiple productions, some ending in terminals. Wait, in the grammar, there's a rule NT0 \u2192 't23'. But also, NT0 can derive other things.\n\nWait, let's check the rules for NT0:\n\nNT0 has multiple productions, including:\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (among others)\n\nWait, in the initial part of the string, 't40' is the first symbol. Does NT0 produce 't40' directly? Looking for a production of NT0 that ends in 't40':\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT0 \u2192 't74' (from NT0 -> NT5 NT5, but in the grammar, it's written as NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and NT5 \u2192 't33'? Wait, in the grammar, under NT0, there's NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and for NT5, one of the rules is NT5 \u2192 't33'. But also, NT0 has another rule: NT0 \u2192 't23'. So 't23' is one of the possible terminals from NT0. So if NT0 produces 't23', that could be part of the string, but the first symbol is 't40'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look again. At the end of the grammar, for NT0, there's a rule: NT0 \u2192 't23', right? So if NT0 can derive 't23', but here the string starts with 't40', which is different.\n\nSo maybe 't40' is not produced directly by NT0. Alternatively, perhaps NT0 can produce a sequence that includes 't40' as a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I should trace a possible path from NT0 to 't40'. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the production rules for NT0:\n1. NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n2. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n3. NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n4. NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n5. NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0\n6. NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nAnd so on. But looking at NT6 and NT9:\n\nNT6 has rules:\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT6 \u2192 NT4 NT2\n- and others, including NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT9:\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- etc.\n\nWait, looking at the rules, there's ND6 \u2192 NT4 NT2 and NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. Not sure yet.\n\nBut let me see: To get 't40' from NT0, perhaps through some chain of productions.\n\nWait, the symbols after 't40' are 't79', then 't28', etc. Maybe it's better to start breaking the string into segments that could be generated by specific non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible sequences that can be derived from each non-terminal. For example, NT0 can produce 't23' directly, but I'm looking for 't40' as the first symbol. So perhaps I need to see if there's a chain starting with NT0 that can derive 't40' as the first step.\n\nLooking through NT0's productions:\n\nWait, in the list of NT0 rules, one of them is NT0 \u2192 't23'. So 't23' is a terminal symbol produced by NT0. But the first symbol is 't40', which seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in that 't40' is part of a longer derivation. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe the order of symbols in the string is not directly the order of derivation. Because S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which would derive a string that combines the NT0's symbols and then the NT4's symbols. So the NT0 part would be the first part, followed by NT4.\n\nBut in the string, each symbol is a terminal that must be matched in order. So to see if S can derive this string, I need to check if NT0 can derive the first k symbols, and NT4 can derive the remaining 17 -k symbols for some k.\n\nBut it's unclear what k is. Maybe I can pick k as the point where S can split into two parts. Let's check for possible k values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can see if the starting S can produce such a string by combining NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me see the production of NT4. In the grammar, the start symbol S produces NT0 NT4. So NT4 is on the right side, so the string must be a concatenation of NT0's derivation and NT4's derivation.\n\nSo the idea is that the string is the result of NT0's derivation followed by NT4's derivation.\n\nTherefore, the string should be split into two parts: the first part derived by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nSo to check if the entire string is generated, I need to see if there's a split point k where the first k symbols form a string generated by NT0, and the remaining (17 -k) symbols form a string generated by NT4.\n\nBut since I don't know k, perhaps I can look for symbols that can only be derived by NT4. Let's check the end of the string to see if there are any such markers.\n\nLooking at the last symbols: ... t52 t79 t76. \n\nIn the grammar, let's see which terminals correspond to NT4's productions. Wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-311","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I need to determine whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is: `t73 t57 t13 t27 t24 t12 t51 t28 t26 t33 t8 t43 t52 t27 t43 t23 t7`. \n\nFirst, I remember that in context-free grammars, especially those in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols, or terminals. So, I should look for the starting symbol S in the grammar and see how the string can be derived from it.\n\nThe grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the initial expansion will involve producing NT0 and NT4. Each of these, in turn, produces other non-terminals, and so on, until we get to terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a sequence of terminals, each representing a 't' followed by a number, except the last one is just 't7'. So, the string is 17 tokens long.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the string into its components:\n1. t73\n2. t57\n3. t13\n4. t27\n5. t24\n6. t12\n7. t51\n8. t28\n9. t26\n10. t33\n11. t8\n12. t43\n13. t52\n14. t27\n15. t43\n16. t23\n17. t7\n\nNow, I'll think about the structure of the grammar. Each production seems to split into two non-terminals, so the string is built in a leftmost derivation manner. Each step should combine two parts, which themselves might be combinations of smaller parts.\n\nI start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the first symbols should come from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions: in the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3, etc. One of the productions is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, which might be useful because in the string, the last two tokens are t27 t43 and t7. Wait, t27 is 't27' which might come from NT27, but wait, looking through the grammar, I see that NT0, NT2, etc., are the non-terminals, and their productions lead to specific terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example, some non-terminals might directly produce specific 't' tokens, like NT2 \u2192 't7', NT3 \u2192 't24', etc. \n\nLet me list out which non-terminals produce which terminals. For example:\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't24' and 't39' (but wait, checking the grammar, NT3 has multiple productions leading to different terminals)\n- NT4 \u2192 't32', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 multiple 't's\n- NT6 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to see which parts of the string can be directly derived from the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string, the first term is t73. Looking back, does any production rule lead to t73? Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, but not directly t73. Or is 't73' a terminal of a non-terminal? Looking through, I don't see a production for any non-terminal directly producing 't73'. Hmm, perhaps 't73' is a terminal from a non-terminal.\n\nWait, no. In the grammar, all the rules are for non-terminals, so perhaps each non-terminal can produce multiple terminals. For example, NT0 has several productions. Let me check: \n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT0 has a production NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, among others. But none of them directly produce 't73'. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that produce terminals. For example, looking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 (again)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 again?\nWait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me look for each non-terminal and see if any of their productions lead to terminal symbols.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n\nNone of these directly produce terminals. Instead, the non-terminals NT6, NT7, etc., have their own productions. So perhaps I need to track how the string can be built from these.\n\nWait, but if none of the NT0's immediate productions produce a terminal directly, perhaps the first two symbols in the string must come from the first two non-terminals in NT0's production and NT4's production.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Let me think differently. The string is a sequence of terminals, so it must be the result of a series of productions where each step combines two non-terminals until all are terminals.\n\nSo, starting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4, we have to see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe string is 17 tokens, so each step of the derivation splits into two parts that will form two smaller strings, each of which must then be able to generate their respective parts.\n\nThis sounds like a recursive approach, where we split the string into left and right halves and check if each half can be generated by NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Check if the left half of the string can be generated by NT0 and the right half by NT4.\n2. Split the string in half and recursively apply the same check for the non-terminals.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is feasible without writing out the entire derivation steps, which would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I could try to see if any non-terminals in the grammar can produce sequences of these terminals.\n\nLooking back at the grammar, I notice that some non-terminals have productions that lead to specific terminals. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23' (I think I saw something like that earlier). Let me check the grammar again.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't24'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT5 \u2192 various 't's\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT8 \u2192 't5'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nWait, but none of these directly produce 't73' or 't57'. So perhaps 't73' is produced by a non-terminal that eventually leads to 't73', but I don't see any immediate production for it in the grammar. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake, perhaps 't73' is not a direct terminal but comes from a combination.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me try to see how the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's rules.\n\nFirst, the string is 17 tokens, so perhaps the last step would be a production that results in a single terminal or a combination, but since it starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, perhaps each non-terminal at each step produces two parts.\n\nSo, let's attempt to see if the string can be generated by S.\n\nStart with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the string must be a combination of NT0's derived string and NT4's derived string.\n\nThe string is 17 tokens, which is an odd number, meaning at some point, one of the non-terminals must produce a terminal symbol at the end or the beginning.\n\nSo, perhaps in the last step, one of the non-terminals produces a terminal.\n\nLooking at the end of the string, the last token is 't7'. I recall that NT7 \u2192 't13', but does any non-terminal produce 't7'? Wait, looking at the grammar, NT9 \u2192 't60', NT2 \u2192 't7', etc. Wait, for example, NT2 \u2192 't7' (I think I saw that).\n\nWait, let me check: in the grammar, NT2 has a production NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT6 as well as other combinations. Wait, but I also see that NT2 \u2192 't7' appears in the terminal list, meaning that NT2 can produce 't7'.\n\nSo if the last token is 't7', then that could come from NT2 \u2192 't7'. Similarly, let's work backwards.\n\nSo, if the last part of the string is 't7', that could be the production of NT2 \u2192 't7'."}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Looking at the grammar rules provided, they all seem to fit this structure except maybe some, but I think it's mostly covered.\n\nNow, the string consists of a series of 't' tokens followed by numbers. The terminals here are 't X' where X is a number, but I'm not sure what the exact terminals are. Wait, looking at the grammar, each production replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. The terminals in the grammar are 't' followed by a number, like 't', 't1', 't12', etc., up to 't99' maybe. But looking at the string, the terminals are like 't8', 't5', 't3', etc. So each 't' followed by a single digit.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, the right-hand sides of the productions sometimes have 'tX' where X is a number. For example, NT2 -> 't7', so 't7' is a terminal. So in the string, each 'tX' where X is a single digit must correspond to the terminals in the grammar.\n\nSo the first step is to verify that each token in the string is present in the grammar's terminals. Let me check the grammar to see which terminals are used.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see that some produce terminal strings like 't8', 't7', 't43', etc. Wait, looking more carefully, I notice rules like NT7 -> 't13', NT4 -> 't5', etc. So each terminal is a 't' followed by a number, and some are single-digit ('t8', 't7'), while others are two-digit ('t43').\n\nSo the string provided is a sequence of these 'tX' symbols. Each of these must be terminals in the grammar for the string to be generated. \n\nNow, I can check if each token in the string is present in the grammar. Let's go through the string:\n\nt8: exists in NT4 -> 't8\nt5: exists in NT5 -> 't5\nt3: exists in NT6 -> 't33 is 't3' no, wait, wait, NT6 has production NT6 -> 't83', which is 't8', 't3' maybe? Wait, no, NT6 is 't8' when it's directly 't83'? No, looking at the grammar, NT6 has rules like NT6 -> 't83', which would parse as 't8' followed by 't3', but perhaps I'm confusing.\n\nWait, no, each NT production that has a terminal as the right-hand side is a direct terminal. For example, NT2 -> 't7' is a terminal. Similarly, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't47' which is 't4' followed by 't7'\u2014but wait, 't4' is not a terminal; it's a non-terminal, right? Or is it?\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, each production that ends with a terminal is of the form NT -> something, but perhaps some of these are terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't7' is a terminal, but others like NT4 -> 't47' is 't4' and 't7'. So in the string, does 't47' appear? Well, the string has 't8', 't5', 't3', 't47', etc. So 't4' is a terminal? Wait, no, in the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't47', meaning that 't47' is a terminal. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Each NT can derive into a string of NTs and terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps each 'tX' in the string corresponds to an actual terminal, which is a single 't' followed by a number. But the grammar seems to have some rules that introduce these terminals. For example, NT9 -> 't5' is a terminal. But other rules have 'tX' as results of concatenation. For example, NT5 -> 't27' is a terminal, which would be 't2' followed by 't7'\u2014but wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, perhaps 'tX' are the terminals in the string. So each 'tX' in the string must be present in the grammar as a terminal. That is, each 'tX' is a production in the grammar, where X is a number. For example, in the grammar, we have NT7 -> 't13', NT4 -> 't5', etc.\n\nSo looking at the given string: t8, t5, t3, t47, t10, t63, t5, t62, t76, t37, t51, t57, t3, t33, t81, t13, t33, t62.\n\nEach of these is a combination of 't' followed by one or two digits. For example, 't47' is a two-digit number, which would correspond to a production like NT4 -> 't47' if that's a terminal.\n\nBut in the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't47', so 't47' is a terminal. Similarly, NT6 -> 't62' is a terminal. So, the given string can be parsed as a sequence of these terminals.\n\nWait, but the string also has 't10', 't33', 't81', 't76', etc. So, do any of these exist as terminals in the grammar?\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example, NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't76' which would be a terminal. Similarly, NT5 -> 't33' is a terminal. NT4 -> 't81' is a terminal. NT6 -> 't62' is a terminal.\n\nWait, but in some grammar rules, like NT2 -> 't7' is a terminal, but others are like NT2 -> 't3', which is also a terminal because in the grammar, NT2 has production NT2 -> 't3' which is a terminal.\n\nSo, the string is composed of terminals that are present in the grammar. So that's good.\n\nNow, the next step is to construct the parse tree for this string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production splits into exactly two symbols, either terminals or non-terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, I can use recursive descent or another method, but maybe it's easier to represent the derivation steps.\n\nThe string length is 18 tokens. So the parse tree would have a height of roughly log2(18) ~ 5 levels.\n\nLet me try to reverse-engineer the parse steps.\n\nThe string: t8 t5 t3 t47 t10 t63 t5 t62 t76 t37 t51 t57 t3 t33 t81 t13 t33 t62.\n\nFirst, the string starts with 't8'. Let's see which NT can produce 't8' as the first symbol. Looking in the grammar, NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't72' which is 't7' and 't2'\u2014but that's not 't8'. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me list the grammar rules again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each rule is a CNF production, either to a non-terminal or to two terminals.\n\nLooking for 't8' as a terminal: NT4 -> 't8' is a production, correct?\n\nWait, in the grammar, there's a rule \"NT4 -> 't8'\". Wait, checking the grammar:\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\nI see a line: NT4 -> 't8'?\nWait, scanning the provided grammar, I see lines like 'NT4 -> 't8' \u2014 no, actually, looking at the specific grammar rules given, there's a line like \"NT4 -> 't8'\", perhaps? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the grammar strings, I see a line:\n\n\"NT6 -> 't83'\"\n\nWait, and another line:\n\n\"NT5 -> 't53'\"\n\nHmm, is there a production for NT4 that results in 't8'? Looking more closely, perhaps the NT4 has a production like NT4 -> 't8'.\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, there's a production \"NT4 -> 't8'\".

The string is `t33 t10 t11 t23 t26 t28 t63 t43 t57 t8 t52 t70 t33 t76 t80 t12 t11 t7`. Hmm, that's quite a long string! \n\nFirst, I should recall that Chomsky normal form grammars have rules where each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. So, every production is either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that it's quite extensive. There are multiple rules, but many of them are rules with two non-terminals on the right side. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is the top-level production. The terminals in the string seem to correspond to some of the non-terminals, but I need to check the productions to see if there are any strings that directly produce these terminals.\n\nI notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For instance, NT7 \u2192 't13' and others. So, to parse the string, I need to see if each part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nOne approach is to try to build a left or right parse tree for the string, but given the size of the string, that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a way to count the number of each non-terminal in the parse tree against the string.\n\nWait, maybe using the fact that the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production leads to a doubling of the number of symbols. So, starting from S, each step doubles the length, or in the case of terminals, the leaves. So, for example, S is replaced by two non-terminals, each of those can be replaced by two more, and so on. This suggests that the parse tree depth is logarithmic in the length of the string, but the actual count of terminals would depend on the specific productions.\n\nBut that might not be directly helpful. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down according to the productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t33 t10 t11 t23 t26 t28 t63 t43 t57 t8 t52 t70 t33 t76 t80 t12 t11 t7`.

No)\nWait, in the string, I see 't8', for example. So maybe NT4 \u2192 't8'?\nLooking back, I think there's a NT4 \u2192 't84' and another \u2192 't8' somewhere. Let me check:\n\nYes, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't8' (once)\nSo, NT4 can produce 't8'.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other terminals in the string: 't10', which is one of the terminals. So, is there a production NT10? Wait, looking through the grammar, I don't see a rule where NT10 is a non-terminal that produces 't10'. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals in the string correspond to the non-terminals that have a production to that terminal. So, for 't10', does any non-terminal in the grammar have a production that ends with 't10'?\n\nLooking through all the rules, perhaps not directly. Maybe it's a non-terminal that eventually produces 't10' through a chain of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string has a terminal 't10' which isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar. That would mean the string can't be generated by the grammar, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misremembering the grammar rules. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't immediately see any rule that ends with 't10'. So for 't10' to be in the string, there must be a non-terminal that can produce it through a series of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps 't10' is a terminal, but none of the productions directly produce it, so the grammar can't derive it. That would mean the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, let me check each step.\n\nThe string includes 't10' as one of the terms. Looking through all the rules, is there any rule that produces 't10'?\n\nLooking through the right-hand sides:\n\n- All the rules either have non-terminals or a terminal and the rest are non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the given grammar, no rule directly produces 't10'. So, to generate 't10', there must be a non-terminal that can produce 't10' through some chain.\n\nBut looking at the rules, I don't see any non-terminals that have a production ending with 't10'. Therefore, it's impossible for the grammar to generate a 't10' terminal. Thus, the string contains a term ('t10') that cannot be derived from the grammar, so the string is not in the language.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-356","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to check is \"t52 t56 t23 t7 t60 t76 t2 t70 t43 t53 t10 t10 t14 t20 t83 t70 t69 t20 t54\". Hmm, that's a lot of t's with numbers. \n\nFirst, I remember that in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except that the left-hand side can also be a terminal. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals. But wait, some sources say that in CNF, all productions are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. So the user is correct; it's either two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nLooking at the given grammar, I see that some of the productions are like S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which is a non-terminal S generating two non-terminals. Others have right-hand sides that sometimes produce terminals, like NT22 \u2192 't14'. So, some right-hand sides are two non-terminals, others are a mix or a terminal.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, all productions except for the terminals should have two non-terminals on the right. So maybe this grammar is not in CNF because some productions have terminals on the right? Let me check. \n\nLooking at the productions, for example, NT0 can produce NT5 NT5, which would be two non-terminals. But NT3 can also produce 't53', which is a terminal. Hmm, that seems like it's a problem because in CNF, if a production has a terminal, it can only be a single terminal. So perhaps this grammar is not in CNF? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the first sentence says the grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form. So perhaps I should accept that and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grammar is actually in CNF because each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal. So, for example, NT3 can produce a terminal 't53' or two non-terminals. That would fit CNF because in CNF, productions can have terminals on the right, as long as each production is of length two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nSo, the string to check is a sequence of terminals. The string is a series of t's like t52, t56, etc. Each of these must correspond to the right-hand side of some production, starting from S and expanding until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven that, the approach is to parse the string using the grammar and see if it can be derived starting from S. Since the grammar has a large number of non-terminals and productions, this might be a bit complex.\n\nI think a better approach is to use a top-down parsing method, like the CYK algorithm, but given the complexity, perhaps starting from the string and trying to match it to possible derivations would be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for specific patterns in the string that correspond to the non-terminals in the productions.\n\nLet's see the string: t52 t56 t23 t7 t60 t76 t2 t70 t43 t53 t10 t10 t14 t20 t83 t70 t69 t20 t54.\n\nEach token here is a terminal, so we can try to find a way to produce these in order.\n\nStarting from S: S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo S would have to produce the given string as the result of NT0 and NT4. So the entire string must be generated by the combined derivations of NT0 and NT4. Let's see.\n\nSo, for NT0, looking at the grammar: NT0 can produce NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7 (from the earlier productions). Similarly, NT4 can produce NT8 NT6, and then NT4 can also produce NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nWait, let's try to see if we can match the string to these sequences. The string starts with t52, which I need to see where it comes from. Looking through the NT productions, I see that NT22 \u2192 't14', but that's not relevant here. Wait, looking for terminals, we have:\n\nLooking through the productions, the string includes t52, t56, t23, etc. So perhaps I can build a tree where each part of the string comes from a non-terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each terminal token must come from a production directly. So, for example, t52 must come from a production whose right-hand side includes 't52' either directly or through other terminals.\n\nLooking at the NT productions, let's see which NTs produce 't52'. Scanning through the list, I see:\n\n- NT22 \u2192 't14' (no)\n- Wait, maybe none of them directly produce 't52'? Or perhaps I missed one.\n\nWait, in the productions, I notice that some NTs produce multiple non-terminals, like NT0-> NT9 NT7, etc., but none of them produce 't52' directly. Alternatively, perhaps 't52' is a part of some longer production. But no, each production is two non-terminals, except the ones that produce terminals like 't23', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the production NT6 \u2192 't83' and 't77', etc. So perhaps some NTs can produce a single terminal.\n\nWait, let's check: NT14's productions include 't20' (from NT4-> 't5', etc.), but not 't52'. Hmm, maybe 't52' comes from NT22's production? No, I don't see that. Looking at the provided productions, I notice that NT0 is defined as NT6 NT7 in some cases, and there are multiple NT0 productions.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the rightmost or leftmost derivation. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to look for which NTs can generate which terminals.\n\nFor example, t52 might come from NT22 \u2192 't14' (no), or perhaps it's part of a longer production where the NT in the production can expand to include t52. Alternatively, maybe I need to see which NTs have t52 in their production.\n\nLooking through the list, I see NT23 \u2192 't23' and NT20 \u2192 't20', but not 't52'. Similarly, looking through the other NTs, perhaps none directly produce t52. So, perhaps the string is invalid, but I might be missing something.\n\nWait, looking through the productions again, perhaps NT22 can produce 't14', but that's not t52. Hmm. Let me check the productions again:\n\nThe list is extensive, but perhaps it's easier to note that each NT can only produce specific terminal symbols. For example, NT23 can produce 't23', which is a terminal. So if the string contains 't23', then that part must come from NT23.\n\nIn the string, I see 't52', 't56', etc. Let me go through each terminal and see if it can come from any production.\n\nt52: Looking through all NT productions, I can't find any production where an NT directly produces 't52'. So, perhaps this means that 't52' cannot be produced by the grammar, making the entire string invalid.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the productions:\n\nLooking at the list, I notice that many NTs produce other NTs, not terminals. The only terminals I see are the ones like 't43', 't53', etc. So, unless there's a production that allows an NT to produce a terminal, it's impossible for a terminal like t52 to appear in the string.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, some NTs do have direct terminals, like NT3 \u2192 't72', etc. So, the question is: is there any NT that can produce 't52'?\n\nLooking at the provided productions:\n\nLooking through all the NT0 to NT96 productions, I don't see any that directly produce t52 as a terminal. For example, NT26 \u2192 't7' (no). NT39 \u2192 't39', NT50 \u2192 't40', etc., but none produce 't52'.\n\nSo, if the string includes a terminal that no NT can produce, then the string is not generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and missed a production that allows an NT to produce 't52'.

{"custom_id":"request-354","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is \"t32 t60 t22 t15 t79 t80 t54 t26 t13 t28 t63 t20 t7 t24 t74 t14 t7 t43 t27\". \n\nFirst, I remember that a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has all productions of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. The given grammar looks like it's in CNF because most of the productions have two non-terminals on the right side, except for some that have terminals. Wait, no, in CNF, terminals can only appear in the start symbol's production, right? So there might be some issues here. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see productions like NT0 \u2192 't23', which suggests that terminals can appear on the right side. That's a problem because in CNF, terminals only appear at the start symbol. So perhaps the grammar isn't in proper CNF, but it might still be a valid context-free grammar. I guess the structure is still CNF, but I might have to be cautious.\n\nNow, the string is a sequence of terminals separated by spaces. I need to check if this string can be derived starting from the start symbol S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the first steps will involve NT0 and NT4.\n\nLet me count the terminals in the string:\n\nt32, t60, t22, t15, t79, t80, t54, t26, t13, t28, t63, t20, t7, t24, t74, t14, t7, t43, t27.\n\nThat's 19 tokens, which is an odd number. The start symbol S produces two non-terminals, and each production either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since terminals only appear in the start symbol's first production, which is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, any subsequent productions would have to be composed of non-terminals, which can then produce terminals.\n\nNow, since the grammar is in CNF, each step produces exactly one terminal or non-terminal. Wait, no, in CNF, each production produces exactly two non-terminals, except when terminals appear in the start symbol. So, the process would generate a binary tree of non-terminals, but each terminal is derived by substituting a non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Maybe it's easier to use the CYK algorithm or some kind of table-filling method to parse the string. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, the number of steps should correspond to the length of the string plus one. But the string length is 19, so if it's in CNF and the first symbol is a non-terminal, the number of symbols should be n+1, which would be 20. But looking at the string length, it's 19, which suggests it's possible if the start symbol is a terminal, but in this case, S is a non-terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. In CNF, the only way to produce terminals is at the top level, so the initial production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Each of those non-terminals produces more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me list the string and see what the order would be. The first symbols are t32, t60. Let's see what NT0 and NT4 can derive. From the grammar:\n\nNT0 is used in S as NT0 NT4. Let's see the productions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking back, NT0 has multiple productions, some of which are to non-terminals. But in the initial step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So both NT0 and NT4 must derive into terminal strings.\n\nLooking at the given string, the first token is t32, so let's see what NT0 can derive. The nt0 productions include t27, which is a terminal. Let me check if NT0 can derive t32. However, looking through the productions for NT0, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- ... etc.\n\nNone of these seem to directly produce t32, but perhaps through expansion. Let me check what NT0 can produce. It seems NT0 can be expanded into a series of non-terminals.\n\nWait, the first token is t32, so maybe NT0 can produce t32 through some chain of productions. But looking at NT0's productions, all seem to be combinations of other non-terminals, except for some that turn into terminals.\n\nWait, let me scan all NT0 productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 \u2192 eventually could lead to t32?\n\nLooking deeper, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then, NT6 and NT7 are further non-terminals. NT6 has productions like NT9 NT8, NT8 NT9, etc. NT7 has productions like NT4 NT0, NT4 NT6, NT6 NT9, etc. Now, t32 might be produced by one of these non-terminals.\n\nLooking through the terminal substitutions:\n\nLooking for 't32', I see in the terminal productions. Let's see:\n\nLooking for 't32', I see that in the given grammar, NT0 has a production to 't23', but no t32. Wait, let me check all the terminal substitutions.\n\nLooking through, I see:\n\nNT5 \u2192 't47', NT4 \u2192 't32', which is part of the string. So 't32' is produced by NT4.\n\nWait, but if the first token is 't32', and S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then one of the NT0 or NT4 must lead to 't32'. But NT4 can produce t32 directly, so perhaps the string starts with t32 as the output of NT4.\n\nWait, but in the first step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which are two non-terminals. So the first token would come from one of these two, either NT0 or NT4. If the first token is t32, which is produced by NT4, then the second non-terminal, NT4, would produce 't63' (as per the first token being t32 and the next being t60, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should construct the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the derivation path. Let's assume that the string is generated by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first terminal t32. Which non-terminal can produce it? Looking through the grammar, NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 't32'.\n\nSo, if the first symbol is t32, that could come from NT4. That means, in the first step, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then NT0 could produce something, and NT4 produces 't32'. But then the rest of the string should come from what NT0 produces.\n\nWait, the string starts with t32, then t60. So after NT4 produces 't32', NT0 must produce a string starting with 't60'. So the next token is t60.\n\nSo, NT0 must derive into starting with t60. Looking at NT0's productions, does any of them lead to t60? Checking NT0's productions, none directly produce a terminal. So NT0 must derive into non-terminals that eventually produce t60.\n\nLooking through NT0's productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- ... and others.\n\nEach of these branches needs to produce a terminal. For example, let's take NT6:\n\n- NT6 can produce NT9 NT8, which then produce terminals.\n\nWait, let's pick NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8. NT9 can produce 't5', and NT8 can produce 't51'. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps NT6 can produce something that leads to t60.\n\nWait, looking through the terminal substitutions, I notice that some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT9 \u2192 't43', which is not in the string. Let's see:\n\nLooking through all terminal substitutions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't51', etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 't32', 't3', 't8', 't37'\n- NT5 \u2192 't27', 't5', 't10', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't11', 't83', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't14', 't13', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't54', 't64', etc.\n- NT0 \u2192 't23', 't28'\n- NT2, NT9, others have various terminals.\n\nWait, so 't60' is a terminal. Looking through, I see NT2 has 't7' and 't24' etc., but '"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-376","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The grammar is quite large, and the string to check is a sequence of tokens. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) entails. CNF is a way to structure context-free grammars where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This simplification helps in parsing algorithms like the CYK algorithm, but for this problem, maybe a top-down approach or recursive descent could work, but since the grammar is extensive, I might need a different strategy.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that most of the rules are binary, meaning each left-hand side (LHS) is a non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) has two non-terminals or terminals. There are some epsilon productions, but since all the rules here lead to terminals, maybe the epsilon isn't directly needed.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t61 t47 t47 t53 t53 t67 t77 t52 t63 t8 t79 t57 t44 t32 t77 t14 t43 t54 t14 t5`. Each 't' represents a terminal symbol, and these are all lowercase, which in CNF usually can only be single characters. Wait, but in the grammar, some rules have more complex combinations, but maybe each 't' is a terminal symbol that can only appear once. \n\nWait, the grammar has several rules where NTi \u2192 txxx. For example, NT6 \u2192 t83, NT5 \u2192 t43, etc. So each of these non-terminals can directly produce a single terminal. Therefore, each 't' in the string must correspond to one of these terminal productions.\n\nSo the given string is a sequence of 20 tokens. Each token is like t61, t47, etc. The task is to see if this sequence of terminals can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar rules.\n\nLet me outline the steps I plan to take:\n\n1. Parse the string token by token.\n2. Starting from S, try to decompose the string into the non-terminals according to the rules.\n3. For each token, see if it can be matched by any terminal production of a non-terminal.\n4. Try to build a parse tree or trace the derivations step by step.\n\nGiven the size of the grammar and the string, this might be tedious, but let's see if I can find a pattern or a way to traverse the string.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt61, t47, t47, t53, t53, t67, t77, t52, t63, t8, t79, t57, t44, t32, t77, t14, t43, t54, t14, t5.\n\nI need to see if the grammar can produce this in order.\n\nLet me consider the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo the first step is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Therefore, the first two non-terminals to derive are NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first two tokens are t61 and t47. So t61 must be generated by NT0 and t47 by NT4.\n\nWait, but each of these could be via different rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nFor NT0, I see rules like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. But in the given grammar, NT0 can produce various combinations, but perhaps the terminal t61 is generated by NT0. Looking through the rules, for example, NT6 \u2192 t83, NT5 \u2192 t43, etc. Hmm, perhaps I need to see which non-terminals produce t61.\n\nLooking through all the terminal rules:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60', 't5', 't43', 't20', 't79', 't84', 't81', 't26', 't3', 't51', 't32', 't57', 't76', 't28', 't15', 't70', 't76', 't64', 't77', 't56', 't44', 't53', 't24', 't2', 't8', 't73', 't70', 't57', 't69', 't51', 't67', 't70', 't62', 't61', 't27', 't39', 't52', 't35', 't67', 't56', 't32', 't77', 't70', 't35', 't70', 't11', 't54', 't43', 't54', 't35', 't77', 't80', 't79', 't9'\n\nSo for example, NT33 \u2192 t61. So if NT0 can produce NT33, which then produces t61.\n\nWait, but looking at theNT0 rules, one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5. So if NT5 can produce t33, then NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 would produce t33 t33.\n\nWait, but the first token is t61, which is not t33.\n\nAlternatively, looking for NT0 leading to t61. Perhaps through a rule like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then NT6 and NT7 can lead to t67 and t14, but wait, t67 is in NT6's rules. Let's check: NT6 \u2192 t67? Looking through NT6's rules, yes, NT6 \u2192 t77, t83, but perhaps in this case, t67 isn't directly a terminal. Hmm, no, in the provided grammar, NT6 has a rule NT6 \u2192 t77, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, looking at the given grammar:\n\nLooking through the NT6 rules, I see NT6 \u2192 t83, but perhaps in the grammar provided, some non-terminals can produce t67.

Or perhaps another rule. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, I see NT54 isn't a direct production for a non-terminal.

Looking at the rules, perhaps NT54? Wait, no. Wait, looking through the grammar provided, I see:\n\nLooking at the list, for example:\n\nNT54 is used in production: NT4 \u2192 NT32, but no, that's a rule for transforming NT4.\n\nWait, perhaps t47 is from NT54? Wait, no, the grammar provided has NT4 rules but not NT54.

{"custom_id":"request-378","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm faced with this problem where I have to determine if a specific string is generated by a given context-free grammar. The grammar is provided in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it simplifies the structure a bit. The string to evaluate is \"t14 t20 t28 t20 t15 t76 t15 t14 t73 t70 t12 t26 t56 t76 t76 t76 t70 t77 t13 t63\". \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. Context-free grammars consist of a start symbol (here, it's S) and production rules that expand that symbol along with others. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So any string derived from S must start with NT0 followed by NT4. Let me break that down.\n\nI notice that NT0 and NT4 can themselves be expanded into other non-terminals. For example, NT0 can go into NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7, and NT4 can go into NT8 NT6 or NT5 NT2, etc. So each of these non-terminals can lead to more non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminals: t14, t20, t28, etc. Each of these must correspond to a terminal symbol in the grammar. Looking through the productions, I see that some non-terminals directly produce these t's. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23', NT2 \u2192 't7', NT4 \u2192 't37', and so on.\n\nMy goal is to see if the entire string can be derived from S by expanding the non-terminals appropriately.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the string. It's a long sequence, so I need to break it down step by step. The first symbol is t14. Let's see which production ends with t14. Looking at the grammar, the production NT2 \u2192 't7' and NT9 \u2192 't60' etc. Wait, maybe I should check the start of the string and see what possible NTs can produce t14.\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't84', which doesn't help. Then NT3 might produce t's? Let me check. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72' or 't53', etc. Wait, no, looking at the list:\n\nLooking through the NT productions, I find NT3 \u2192 't72' (NT3 \u2192 't72'), NT8 \u2192 't5', NT9 \u2192 't43', etc. Hmm, not seeing t14 yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me look again. The grammar has NT0 \u2192 't23', which is not t14. Is there any NT that directly produces t14? Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 't37', which isn't t14. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps t14 is produced by an NT that isn't directly listed here. Let me check each production rule for NTs that might result in t14.\n\nLooking through all the terminal assignments:\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT5 -> 't47', 't3', etc.\n- NT6 -> 't83', 't77', etc.\n- NT7 -> 't13', 't54', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't5', etc.\n- NT9 -> 't60', etc.\n- NT3 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nHmm, I don't see any production that directly results in 't14' as a terminal. That's a problem. Because the first symbol is t14, which must come from a production rule where NT produces 't14'. But in the given grammar, none of the NTs have 't14' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed looking. Let me go through the entire list of productions for terminals again:\n\nLooking at each NT production and the terminals they produce:\n\nNT0: 't23'\nNT2: 't7'\nNT4: 't37'\nNT5: 't47', 't3', 't27', 't53', 't70', 't84', 't9', 't43'\nNT7: 't13', 't54', 't76', 't33', 't43'\nNT6: 't83', 't77', 't99', 't11', etc. Wait, no 't14' here.\nNT8: 't5', 't21', 't64', 't56', etc. No 't14' either.\nNT3: 't72', 't51', etc.\nNT9: 't60', etc.\nOther NTs: NT1, NT10, etc., aren't present in the provided rules.\n\nSo, in the grammar, none of the NTs produce 't14'. That seems problematic because the string starts with t14, which the grammar can't produce. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again if any NT produces 't14':\n\n- NT0: 't23'\n- NT2: 't7'\n- NT4: 't37'\n- NT5: 't47' etc., no t14.\n- NT6: 't83', no.\n- NT7: 't13' etc.\n- NT8: 't5' etc., no.\n- NT9: 't60' etc., no.\n- NT3: 't72' etc., no.\n\nSo, indeed, no NT directly produces 't14'. Therefore, the string cannot be produced by this grammar because the first symbol, t14, doesn't appear anywhere as a terminal in the given productions. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-394","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar presented in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t40 t51 t26 t5 t69 t77 t7 t62 t40 t26 t62 t53 t83 t72 t62 t79 t67 t53 t26 t10 t37`. Hmm, that's a pretty long string with a bunch of tokens like t40, t51, etc.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is. CNF is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. This form is helpful for parsing because it simplifies the grammar into a form that can be handled by algorithms like the CYK algorithm. However, since the string is given, I might not need Cyk here; maybe a top-down approach or checking if the string can be generated by expanding the start symbol.\n\nWait, but the grammar provided is quite extensive. Let me look at the grammar rules to see how the non-terminals produce the terminals.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I notice that most of the productions lead to non-terminals, except some produce terminals like 't43', 't72', etc. For example, NT2 -> 't7' and others. So the terminals in the string must be derived from these non-terminals.\n\nSo, the strategy would be to check if each token in the string can be derived from some non-terminal in the grammar. But wait, the string is a sequence of tokens, which would correspond to the production of the start symbol S. So the entire string must be a sequence of terminal symbols produced by expanding S.\n\nAnother way is to think that the string is derived from S, so each token must be generated through a series of derivations. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either a terminal or two non-terminals.\n\nLet me start by looking at the starting symbol S. The production for S is S -> NT0 NT4, which is a production to two non-terminals. So S must start with NT0 and then NT4. So the string must start with something from NT0 and then from NT4.\n\nLooking at the first token in the string: t40. So, where does t40 come from? Looking at the grammar, I see that NT0 -> 't23', NT2 -> 't7', etc. Wait, but t40 is a terminal. So I need to check if there's a production for a non-terminal that eventually produces t40.\n\nLooking through the NT0 rules: I see NT0 -> NT5 NT5, and also NT0 -> NT9 NT7, which might not directly help. Wait, no, let's look at the rules for NT0: \n\nLooking through the production rules under NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nWait, the given grammar has:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nAnd also some other productions for NT0? Wait, let me find the NT0 rules.\n\nLooking through the provided rules, under NT0, I think the relevant ones are:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nHmm, so several possibilities for NT0.\n\nEach of these leads to two non-terminals. Let's see what those non-terminals produce.\n\nStarting with t40 as the first token, which must be produced by one of these NT0 rules. So, for example, in one rule, NT0 -> NT9 NT7, so t40 would have to come from NT9 and NT7.\n\nBut wait, the first token is t40, which should be the result of the first part of the production. So, for NT0 -> NT9 NT7, the first symbol after expansion would be whatever NT9 can produce as a terminal. Similarly, for NT0 -> NT6 NT7, the first symbol is NT6.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see for NT0:\n\n- NT0 can produce 't23' via NT0 -> 't23' (yes, looking at the provided rules, NT0 -> 't23' is there).\n- Also, NT0 -> 't43' (looking through the provided rules, I see NT0 -> 't43' exists).\n- Other options include NT0 leading to 't35' or 't83', etc. Wait, no, looking again, the NT0 rules in the provided list include:\n\nWait, let me try to parse through the provided grammar:\n\nThe user provided a set of rules. For example, under NT0, some rules are:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT0 -> 't43'\nNT0 -> 't35'\nNT0 -> 't83'\nNT0 -> 't5'\nWait, so NT0 can directly produce several terminals. So 't40' is not among these. Alternatively, I may have misread, perhaps NT0 has a production that leads to t40? Wait, no, in the provided rules, I don't see NT0 directly producing t40. So 't40' must come from a non-terminal that can produce it.\n\nLooking through other NT rules, I need to see if any of the NT non-terminals can produce t40. Let me scan through the production rules for each NT.\n\nLooking at NT2: \n\nNT2 -> 't7' (from the rules, under NT2: NT2 -> 't7'), and other rules. So t7 is terminal, not t40.\n\nNT3:\n\nLooking through the rules, I don't see NT3 directly producing t40. Wait, let me check under NT3. The rules for NT3 are:\n\nNT3 -> 't53', 't39', 't31', 't37', etc. Not t40.\n\nNT5:\n\nLooking through NT5 rules, I don't see any t40. For example, NT5 -> 't3', 't10', etc. Not t40.\n\nNT6:\n\nLooking through rules, under NT6: \n\nNT6 -> 't83', 't61', etc. Not t40.\n\nNT7:\n\nNT7 -> 't54', 't74', 't33', etc. Not t40.\n\nNT8:\n\nNT8 can produce t11, t5, t53, etc. Not t40.\n\nNT9:\n\nProducing t44, t60, etc. Not t40.\n\nSo none of the immediate non-terminals directly produce t40. Therefore, 't40' must be the result of a two-step derivation from some NT that leads back to t40.\n\nBut wait, the production S -> NT0 NT4 must produce the string, so the first part is NT0's derivation and the second part is NT4's.\n\nSo, assuming that 't40' is the first symbol, it must come from either the leftmost or rightmost position in NT0 or NT4. For example, if NT0 starts with t40, then NT0 must have a production that can generate t40 as its first symbol. Similarly for NT4.\n\nSo, looking again:\n\nDoes any of the NT0 rules have a direct production of t40? In the provided rules, I don't see NT0 producing 't40' as a terminal. Instead, according to the provided rules:\n\nLooking through all NT0 rules, none directly produce 't40'. Instead:\n\n- NT0 can produce 't23'\n- 't43'\n- 't35'\n- 't5'\n- 't83'\n\nWait, but perhaps 't40' is produced through a chain. For example, NT0 might derive through another NT that eventually produces 't40'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread and there is a rule for NT0 that produces 't40' indirectly. Hmm, let me double-check.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules again:\n\nLooking for 't40' in any of the NT productions, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, upon closer examination, NT4's production rules are listed, and I see NT4->'t37' among others. So nt4 can produce t37, but nothing else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me check each NT to see if any can produce 't40' as a terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed it. Let me scan all the provided NT rules for any that directly produce 't40'. I don't see any NT directly producing 't40' as a terminal. So perhaps t40 is produced by some combination of NTs. Maybe one of the non-terminals can produce t40 via two steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't40' is not in the language given the provided grammar, so the string can't start with 't40' because none of the NTs can produce it directly or indirectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in looking through the grammar.\n\nWait,"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

In this case, the terminals seem to be various 't' followed by numbers, like t47, t7, etc. The non-terminals are all the NT followed by numbers, like NT7, NT6, etc.\n\nThe goal is to parse the string to see if it can be derived from the start symbol S. The string is a sequence of terminals, so we need to find a derivation path from S that leads to these terminals in order.\n\nThe initial step is to look at the start symbol S, which according to the grammar, is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So our derivation starts with NT0 and NT4, each of which will derive a sequence of terminals.\n\nLet me write down the string as a list to process token by token: [t47, t7, t63, t12, t2, t26, t53, t57, t63, t17, t76, t69, t76, t57, t12, t43, t53, t54, t26, t63, t53]\n\nThe string needs to be divided into parts where each part corresponds to a non-terminal expansion. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is a binary split, so the string should be divided into a sequence of non-terminals that can expand into the terminals in order.\n\nLet me try to map the terminals to the possible non-terminals that can produce them. Each terminal is a specific 't' followed by a number. Each non-terminal can produce one terminal string. So, for each terminal in the string, I need to find which non-terminal can produce that terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT4 \u2192 t32\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT6 \u2192 t83\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT4 appears multiple times, the relevant one is NT4 \u2192 t32\n- NT7's other rules might not be relevant here because the string doesn't have t7s except the one leading to t13, which is NT7.\n\nWait, but looking at the string, the second term is t7. From the grammar, NT7 can produce t13, but t7 itself. Wait, I need to check if any non-terminal directly produces t7. Looking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n\nYes, that's a production. So t7 comes from NT2.\n\nSimilarly, t63: Let's see, looking for any non-terminal that directly produces t63.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT6 \u2192 t77\n- NT5 \u2192 t33\n- NT2 \u2192 t7\n- Wait, maybe I should look for NT that produce t63.\n\nAh, perhaps I need to see how t63 is derived. Or maybe t63 is a terminal and needs to be generated by a non-terminal that produces t63. But in the grammar, looking for any NT that produces t63 directly.\n\nLooking through the rules: Oh, I don't see any NT directly producing t63. So perhaps t63 is a two-step expansion or it's part of a longer process. Alternatively, maybe there's an error because the string might contain a terminal that isn't covered.\n\nWait, but looking at the rules again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again:\n\n- Looking for T63: in the rules, do any NT produce t63? Let me go through them again.\n\nLooking through the rules, for example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t53 (so t35 would be another, but there's no NT35)\nWait, in the given grammar, all the rules are for NTs like NT0, NT1, etc., but in this specific problem, most of the NTs are like NT0, NT4, etc., with specific productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed some productions. Let me go through the entire list again.\n\nI see rules like:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT7 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n- NT5 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\n- NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n- NT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT3 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n- NT3 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0\n- NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT2 \u2192 NT3 NT2\n- NT9 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT4 \u2192 NT7 NT3\n- NT7 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT14 (Wait, looking down further)\n- Oh, wait, looking at the end of the provided grammar, there are a lot of rules. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, let me list all the NT productions to see if any of them produce t63:\n\nHere's the full list:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT7 -> NT0 NT2\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\nNT6 -> NT0 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT8 -> NT5 NT3\nNT5 -> NT9 NT6\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT7 -> NT4 NT0\nNT7 -> NT4 NT6\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9\nNT8 -> NT6 NT0\nNT2 -> NT7 NT2\nNT9 -> NT5 NT2\nNT3 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT5 -> NT6 NT7\nNT5 -> NT7 NT3\nNT3 -> NT0 NT8\nNT3 -> NT3 NT0\nNT6 -> NT7 NT0\nNT7 -> NT7 NT0\nNT2 -> NT3 NT2\nNT9 -> NT6 NT0\nNT8 -> NT5 NT5\nNT4 -> NT7 NT3\nNT7 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT9 NT14  \u2190 This is a new rule, perhaps added in the provided grammar? Wait, looking at the provided grammar, after the initial list, it seems to have multiple rules, some possibly more.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, towards the end, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT7 NT3\nNT7 -> NT8 NT6\nNT5 -> NT0 NT8  \u2190 Wait, no, earlier in the list, I thought some rules were duplicated, but looking carefully, perhaps I missed some.\n\nBut wait, perhaps 't63' is a terminal that needs to be generated. But looking through the NT productions, I don't see any NT producing t63 directly. So either t63 is a mistake, or perhaps it's produced through a series of non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The string is `t47 t7 t63 t12 t2 t26 t53 t57 t63 t17 t76 t69 t76 t57 t12 t43 t53 t54 t26 t63 t53`, which has 21 tokens.\n\nEach non-terminal must generate a sequence of terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation splits a non-terminal into two non-terminals. So, the initial S splits into two non-terminals, say A and B. Each of them can split again into two, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo, the string's length is 21 tokens. Each split from NT produces 2 tokens. Starting from S (1 NT), which splits into 2 NTs (2 nodes), then each of those splits into 2, so 4 nodes, and so on. The total number of tokens is equal to 2^(n+1) - 1, where"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-411","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is `t44 t22 t7 t70 t8 t74 t44 t77 t52 t43 t53 t60 t44 t64 t33 t70 t2 t67 t20 t7 t74 t13`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar and the string. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule has either two non-terminals or a terminal on the right-hand side. That usually makes parsing easier, like using the CYK algorithm, but since I'm just checking if the string is generated, maybe I can find a way to parse the string step by step.\n\nI'll start by looking at the grammar rules. There are many rules, mostly for terminals that produce combinations of other terminals and non-terminals. Each non-terminal is defined by combining two non-terminals or a terminal. The string consists of all terminals, which are things like 't44', 't22', etc. So, I need to map each of these terminals to their corresponding production rules.\n\nI should probably start breaking down the string from the beginning. The string starts with 't44', so I'll look for the production rules that produce 't44'. Looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't70' (but that's not 't44')\n- NT4 \u2192 't32' (no)\n- NT0 \u2192 't43' (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 't76' (no)\n- NT3 \u2192 't76' (no)\n- NT5 \u2192 't47' (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 't43' (no)\n- NT4 \u2192 't37' (no)\n- Wait, I need to double-check. Let me look through the grammar rules for terminals:\n\nI see several rules that directly produce terminals, such as NT0 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc.\n\nWait, actually, in the grammar, each rule is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So each terminal in the string is generated by a single production rule.\n\nSo, for each terminal in the string, I need to find which non-terminal's production includes that terminal as the result. Then, I can work backwards to see if the entire string can be generated.\n\nAlternatively, since it's in CNF, I can try building a parse tree from the start symbol S by recursively applying the productions.\n\nLet's start with the string and see if we can parse it token by token, reconstructing the parse tree.\n\nThe string is: t44 t22 t7 t70 t8 t74 t44 t77 t52 t43 t53 t60 t44 t64 t33 t70 t2 t67 t20 t7 t74 t13.\n\nThat's 21 tokens. Each token is a terminal, so each must correspond to a production rule in the grammar that produces that exact terminal.\n\nI'll go through each token and see which production rules produce them.\n\n1. t44: Looking at the grammar, when does any non-terminal produce t44? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, for NT7 \u2192 't54', no. Other NT rules for producing t's:\n\nLooking through the rules, for example, NT5 \u2192 't3', NT0 \u2192 't74', etc. Wait, perhaps I can list all the rules that produce terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules again, here are the terminals mentioned:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7' (multiple times)\n- NT3 \u2192 't72', 't53', 't70', 't2', 't50' (multiple times)\n- NT4 \u2192 't37', 't32', 't43', 't47', 't57', 't54', 't32', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't47', 't8', 't3', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't83', 't77', 't61', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't70', 't43', 't76', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't11', 't5', 't57', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't44', 't51', etc.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The rules given are all the productions. Some have exact terminals, others combine non-terminals.\n\nSo for example, NT3 \u2192 't72', which would mean that 't72' is produced by NT3.\n\nSimilarly, NT0 \u2192 't43', NT7 \u2192 't13', etc.\n\nWait, but in some rules, non-terminals are combined, but others produce a single terminal.\n\nSo each token in the string must be the result of a single production that directly outputs that token. So for each token, I need to find an appropriate non-terminal.\n\nLet me try to map each token in the string to its corresponding non-terminal and production.\n\n1. t44: Looking at the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 't70', but that's not it. Let me check all production rules to see if any produce 't44' directly.\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72' (no)\n- NT5 \u2192 't47' (no)\n- NT6 \u2192 't83' (no)\n- NT7 \u2192 't70' (no)\n- NT8 \u2192 't11' (no)\n- NT9 \u2192 't44' \u2192 Yes! So, t44 is from NT9 \u2192 't44'\n\nSo the first token 't44' comes from NT9 \u2192 't44'. So in the parse tree, NT9 is the root, and the first token is 't44'.\n\nNext token: t22. Looking for a production rule that directly produces 't22'. Looking through the rules:\n\n- I see NT3 \u2192 't2' (no)\n- NT8 \u2192 't21' (no)\n- NT2 \u2192 't7' (no)\n- Maybe I missed it. Wait, looking again: the rules are listed in the prompt, for example, NT3 has several productions. Let me check if any rule directly produces 't22'.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't immediately see 't22' being produced. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me check each production rule:\n\nLooking at the rules, NT24? No, but NT0 is 't23', NT2 is 't7'.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to check if any production directly outputs 't22'. Let's go through the rules:\n\nLooking through all the grammar rules for terminals:\n\nLooking, I see:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't7', no\n- NT3 \u2192 't72' (no), 't70' (no), 't53' (no), 't2' (no)\n- NT5 \u2192 't3', 't47', etc.\n- NT7 \u2192 't70', 't13', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't21', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't84', 't51', etc.\n\nWait a minute, I'm not seeing any rule that directly produces 't22'. That's problematic because the string starts with t22, which doesn't have a corresponding production. So unless I'm missing something, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to build the parse tree step by step correctly, considering that larger productions may have multiple steps, but the initial tokens must come from direct terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in reverse. Starting from the entire string and trying to break it down into production rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through the rules. Let me check again for 't22'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' (no)\n- NT1: Not present as a non-terminal in the rules? Wait, actually, the non-terminals are all the ones with arrows pointing to them. Let me check the grammar's non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the grammar, non-terminals are any symbols that appear on the left of a production.\n\nSo all symbols like S, NT0, NT1,... Well, the full list is extensive since the grammar is complex.\n\nWait, but some non-terminals may not exist because their productions only go to terminals.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.

Let me start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That helps because it simplifies the parsing process.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t17 t53 t53 t20 t5 t8 t76 t12 t70 t8 t43 t27 t10 t56 t79 t70 t63 t15 t26 t63 t20 t81 t77`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So the initial step should split the string into two parts that can be generated by NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nLet's look for where NT4 can produce parts of the string. NT4 has productions like NT4 -> NT5 NT2, NT4 -> NT8 NT6, etc. Similarly, NT0 has several productions, some of which lead to terminals like 't17', 't53', etc.\n\nI notice that the first token is 't17'. Looking at the NT4 productions, NT4 can directly produce 't17' via NT4 -> t17. But wait, actually looking back, in the grammar, NT4 appears in multiple productions, and one of them is NT4 -> t5. Hmm, but 't17' isn't directly in one of the NT4 productions. Wait, perhaps I need to look through the grammar more carefully.\n\nWait, I see: looking through the NT4 productions, none directly produce 't17' as a terminal. The NT4 -> t5 is one. So maybe 't17' comes from another rule, perhaps through NT6 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, no, looking at the grammar, none of the NT4 productions lead directly to 't17'. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let's check the grammar again for NT4.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nAnd other productions for NT5, NT6, etc., but not one that directly produces 't17'.\n\nWait, perhaps 't17' comes from another non-terminal. Let's look through the grammar for tokens like 't17' and see where they appear as terminals. I notice that NT4 has 't5', but 't17' isn't listed as a terminal in the grammar. Wait, no, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT7 -> t70, NT6 -> t77, etc. Wait, but let me check:\n\nHmm, no, looking through the grammar, I don't see 't17' as a terminal for any non-terminal. So perhaps 't17' can't be produced directly. That raises a red flag. If 't17' isn't part of any production, then the string can't be generated by the grammar. So maybe the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any production. Let's look through all the terminal parts:\n\nLooking through the productions, I see NT0, NT2, NT4, etc., but for example:\n\n- NT6 -> t77\n- NT7 -> t70\n- NT5 -> t27\n- NT3 -> t72\n- NT8 -> t5\n- NT4 -> t5\n- NT7 -> t43\n- NT4 -> t3\n- NT0 -> t23\n- NT2 -> t7\n- NT9 -> t44\n- NT5 -> t15\n- NT3 -> t53\n- NT4 -> t28\n- NT7 -> t54\n- NT5 -> t31\n- NT0 -> t43\n- NT2 -> t26\n- NT3 -> t24\n- etc.\n\nWait, none of these produce 't17'.

Hmm, where do I start?\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. So, each production rule is helpful because it tells me how to break down the string into smaller parts.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the starting symbol is S, which produces NT0 and NT4. So, any valid string should have a derivation starting with NT0 and NT4. The given string is a sequence of t's followed by numbers, which are terminals. I notice that each t is probably the start of a terminal symbol.\n\nLet me first check each production to see which non-terminals can generate each terminal. For example, NT0 \u2192 t23, and also other combinations. Wait, but I see that some NTs have multiple productions, some including other NTs and terminals.\n\nI think the approach here is to parse the string from left to right, trying to match each part to the productions. However, given the complexity, maybe I can build a parse tree or use memoization.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is provided, I can try breaking it down. Let me write the string without spaces to see it as a sequence: t57 t47 t2 t77 t83 t61 t80 t70 t57 t7 t53 t83 t53 t33 t40 t83 t53 t20 t80 t63 t17 t39 t28.\n\nEach of these is a token, but in grammar terms, each t followed by a number is a single terminal symbol. So, each 'tn' is a single terminal.\n\nLet me try to match the first part. The string starts with t57. Looking at the grammar, NT7 can produce t54 and t33, but also other combinations. Wait, no, NT7 is a non-terminal, and in the grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT2\nWait, but how do these non-terminals connect to terminals?\n\nI think I need to find a path from S to the entire string. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the string should be generated by expanding NT0 and NT4 into terminals.\n\nLet me consider NT0 and NT4 in the starting production. So, the string should be a concatenation of the expansions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the start, the first token is t57. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t57. Looking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT57? Hmm, wait, NT7 can be expanded in some ways. For example, NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0. Wait, that's not directly a terminal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused because the non-terminals are named with capital letters and may have terminals in their productions. So, for each NT, I need to see what they produce.\n\nWait, for NT7, the productions are:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0\nNT7 \u2192 NT4 NT6\n\nHmm, so NT7 can only produce sequences involving other non-terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, the first token is t57. Which non-terminal can generate t57? Let's look for any NT that has a production ending with t57.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see NT4 can produce t37, t5, etc. Wait, no. Let me go through each NT rule and see which can produce terminals.\n\nWait, for NT7, looking at the rules, I don't see any NT7 \u2192 ... \u2192 t57. Wait, in the provided rules, I see a production NT7 \u2192 NT7 NT0, which is a recursive rule, but doesn't produce a terminal directly.\n\nSimilarly, looking for other non-terminals that can produce t57 directly. Wait, does any NT produce t57 in a single step? Let me check all productions.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nI see NT0 \u2192 t23, t28, etc. NT7 \u2192 t54, t33. Hmm, t57 is in the string, so which NT could produce that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the string's t57 corresponds to NT7's production. Let me check:\n\nLooking for any production of NT7 that could generate t57. In the provided rules, I see NT7 \u2192 NT3 NT6, or NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc. Wait, no NT7 production directly ends with t57.\n\nSimilarly, I'm looking for NT7 \u2192 t57, but I don't see that. Instead, NT7 might produce longer sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if the starting symbols can derive to the string. Let me try to see.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, maybe I can parse it step by step.\n\nFirst, the string starts with t57. So, perhaps the first part is produced by NT0, which may produce t57 somewhere in its expansion.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, and others. Wait, none of these directly produce t57 as a terminal. So, the expansion must occur recursively.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by building a parse tree starting from S, and seeing if I can reach the entire string.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a concatenation of terminals, perhaps I can work backwards, checking if each part matches the grammar.\n\nLet me see if the string token sequence can be broken down step by step.\n\nThe string is: [t57, t47, t2, t77, t83, t61, t80, t70, t57, t7, t53, t83, t53, t33, t40, t83, t53, t20, t80, t63, t17, t39, t28]\n\nLet me check the first few tokens to see if I can find a match.\n\nt57: From NT7, perhaps. Looking at NT7's productions, NT7 can go to NT4 NT0 or NT4 NT6. So t57 might come from NT7's expansion.\n\nLooking at NT4 and NT0, maybe NT4 can produce t57 somehow. Hmm, let me check NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT2, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3, etc. None of these directly produce a terminal, except when the non-terminals eventually expand to terminals.\n\nWait, but in the string, t57 is the first token. So, to get t57 as the first token, the expansion of NT0 or NT4 must start with t57.\n\nBut looking at NT7's production: NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0. So if NT7 is expanded first, then the first part would start with something produced by NT4.\n\nAlternatively, NT7 could be produced by the starting symbol S, but S \u2192 NT0 NT4, which would produce two non-terminals, so the string is a concatenation of their expansions.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT0 and NT4. So, the first part of the string is the expansion of NT0, and the second part is the expansion of NT4.\n\nLet me check if that split works.\n\nThe string is 23 tokens long. Is the split after 12 tokens? Or perhaps different. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string, if S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then the entire string is expand(NT0) + expand(NT4).\n\nSo, the breakdown would be something like [t57, t47, t2, ... up to token 12] followed by [ ... up to token 23].\n\nBut 23 is the length. So perhaps at token 12, the split occurs.\n\nWait, not sure. Let me try to see which parts could match NT0 and NT4's expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to see if the entire string corresponds to either NT0 or NT4 producing the entire string. But since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, both must be expanded.\n\nWait, perhaps I can start by checking if the first part is the expansion of NT0 and the second part is NT4. The string length is 23, so let's say first 12 tokens for NT0 and next 11 for NT4? Not sure. Maybe the split is somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first token t57 comes from NT7, which is in NT0's productions.\n\nWait, in NT0's productions, one is NT6 NT7.

Hmm, some might not, which could immediately say 'No', but I need to check each one.\n\nLet me look at each symbol:\n\n- t15: Looking through the productions, I see NT5 -> 't33', which is for t33, but t15 is not listed directly. I need to see if t15 can be derived from any rule. Wait, looking at NT5, it's rewritten into NT10 and NT6, but I don't see any terminal rule for t15. So t15 isn't present anywhere, which would make the string invalid. But let me keep going because maybe it's generated through some other path.\n\nWait, wait, actually, no. In Chomsky normal form, every non-terminal must be rewritten, and any terminal must be a single symbol. Therefore, if the string contains t15, which is a terminal symbol but doesn't appear in any production, the string can't be generated. So if t15 isn't a terminal in any production, the answer is 'No'.\n\nWait, let me double-check the productions. Looking through all the rules, the only terminals are like t15\u2014oh, wait, looking through all the productions, I see:\n\n- NT5 -> 't47' (t47)\n- NT7 -> 't13' (t13)\n- NT3 -> 't72' (t72)\n- NT5 -> 't27' (t27)\n- NT4 -> 't32' (t32)\n- NT7 -> 't54' (t54)\n- NT4 -> 't5' (t5)\n- NT0 -> 't23' (t23)\n- NT5 -> 't3' (t3)\n- NT4 -> 't32' (t32)\n- NT7 -> 't54' (t54)\n- NT4 -> 't8' (t8)\n- Wait, I don't see 't15' anywhere. The earliest I see is t3, t5, t8, t13, etc., but no t15.\n\nSo t15 is not present in any of the productions. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar because it contains a terminal (t15) that is not defined by any production rule. Hence, the answer is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is `t62 t26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 t53 t43 t53 t77 t8 t76 t80 t43 t69 t70`.\n\nFirst, I should recall the structure of the grammar. Since it's in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nThe start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So the derivation starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t62, which I suspect is from a terminal production. Looking at the grammar, I see rules like NT3 \u2192 't72', so the terminals correspond to these 't' followed by numbers.\n\nI should probably parse the string step by step, starting from S and seeing if I can match the string by expanding according to the grammar.\n\nLet me start with the string:\n\nt62 t26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 t53 t43 t53 t77 t8 t76 t80 t43 t69 t70\n\nI'll try to map this to possible derivations.\n\nFirst, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So we have to split the string into parts that match NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, maybe the first term is t62, which is produced by NT6 \u2192 't62' or perhaps NT3 \u2192 't72' which isn't t62. Wait, NT3 has 't72', but t62 is another terminal. Maybe NT5 \u2192 't62' because I see NT5 \u2192 't62' in the grammar. Or is there another non-terminal that produces 't62'?\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT5 -> 't62' (Yes), so if NT0 is supposed to be 't62', is there a production for NT0 \u2192 't62'? Wait, looking back, the grammar for NT0 includes:\n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\nNT0 -> NT2 NT9\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\nAnd in the terminals, NT0 is 't23', NT5 is 't53'? Wait, no, the terminal list has:\n\nNT0: 't23', 't62', 't26', etc.\n\nWait, actually, let me list out all the terminals from the grammar. It looks like each rule, when a terminal is present, it's represented as 'tnumber'. So, for example:\n\nNT0 -> 't23', 't53', 't62', etc.\n\nSo for NT0, possible terminals are 't23', 't53', 't62', etc.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t62, which would correspond to NT0 \u2192 't62', so NT0 would be t62.\n\nSo the first part is NT0 = t62.\n\nNow, what about the next part: after NT0, we have to account for the rest of the string.\n\nSo after the initial NT0 (t62), the next part would come from NT4. So NT4 should generate the rest of the string after t62.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT5\n\nSo let's see: after t62, we have 't26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 t53 t43 t53 t77 t8 t76 t80 t43 t69 t70'\n\nWait, no. Wait the entire string is one linear sequence; I think I misread the initial breakdown.\n\nWait, the string is `t62 t26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 t53 t43 t53 t77 t8 t76 t80 t43 t69 t70`\n\nSo the entire sequence is 25 tokens. So if S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then the string must start with NT0, then NT4.\n\nSo the initial two terms: t62 and t26. Wait, no, no\u2014 the way the string is given, it's a linear list, so the entire string is NT0 followed by NT4.\n\nSo S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the string starts with NT0, then NT4.\n\nWait, so in the string, the order is [t62, t26, ...], which would mean that NT0 is t62, and NT4 must produce the rest: t26, t52, t33, etc.\n\nSo let's see: NT0 produces t62, and then NT4 must produce the rest of the string. So check if NT4 \u2192 ... can produce the rest: t26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 t53 t43 t53 t77 t8 t76 t80 t43 t69 t70.\n\nNow, let's see: where does the 't26' come from. 't26' must be a terminal, which in the grammar, for example:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't7' (I think), but also ND2 might be 't26'?\n\nWait, looking at the terminal mappings, let's list all the 't's:\n\nFrom NT0: 't23', 't53', 't62', etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list each symbol's possible productions.\n\nLet me make a list:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT0: 't23', 't53', 't62', 't9', 't74', 't2', 't43', 't28', 't35', 't67', 't10', 't52', 't43', 't74', 't53', etc. But perhaps I should look for 't26' as a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nNT2 \u2192 't7', but wait I'm looking for 't26'\u2014is there any production that ends with 't26'?\n\nYes, let's search the entire list.\n\nLooking for NTx \u2192 't26':\n\nLooking through all the productions:\n\n- I see NT3 \u2192 't24' and 't53' etc., but not t26.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check through each production rule to see if 't26' is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\nLooking at each rule that has a terminal (a string starting with 't...'):\n\nLooking at the grammar, in the terminal parts:\n\nIt's a long list, let me see:\n\nLooking for entries where the left-hand side (the non-terminal) is a single terminal (like 't26').\n\nWait, looking through:\n\nFor example:\n\nNT9 -> 't43'\n\nNT2 -> 't7'\n\nNT4 -> 't5'\n\n... etc.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the grammar.\n\nLooking through all the rules for the non-terminals and terminals:\n\nWait, the grammar is given as a list of lines, each line is a production, either like \"S -> NT0 NT4\" or \"NT2 -> 't7' NT6\".\n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse each production correctly, both non-terminals and terminals.\n\nBut regardless, I think the key is to match the string step by step.\n\nGiven that, let me proceed.\n\nAfter NT0 \u2192 't62', the rest of the string is: 't26 t52 t33 t79 t17 t74 t24 t10 t14 t63 t10 t10 t26 ...'\n\nSo, after t62 (NT0), the next symbol is t26, which must come from the NT4.\n\nSo, NT4 must derive to the sequence starting with t26, then t52, etc.\n\nLooking at the possible productions for NT4:\n\nNT4 can go to nt8 nt6, nt5 nt2, etc.\n\nLooking at possible ways to produce 't26' and then 't52'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should see if 't26' is a terminal or from a non-terminal"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

Let me see which terminals (the 't' followed by numbers) are present in the string. The string is: t33 t24 t40 t63 t40 t60 t61 t39 t43 t3 t57 t10 t43 t27 t31 t43 t53 t13 t63 t53 t53 t15 t24 t14.\n\nLooking at these, I see several 't' terms. Each of these must be the result of applying a production rule that eventually reduces to these terminals, which are defined by the productions.\n\nFor example, some of these like t33 can be directly produced by NT0 \u2192 't33' or NT4 \u2192 't33'. Let me see how each token can be generated.\n\nLet me try to parse the entire string step by step, building the parse tree.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S produces two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4. Both need to be expanded to produce the tokens.\n\nSo let me look at the string as two parts: the tokens generated by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is t33. So perhaps NT0 generates t33 and NT4 generates some other tokens. Let's check.\n\nBut wait, looking at the string, the first few tokens are t33, t24, t40, etc. So the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would produce a sequence of tokens starting with what NT0 can produce.\n\nLet me see NT0's productions. Looking at the grammar, NT0 can go to NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7 or NT6 NT0, etc. It seems that each NT production has two non-terminals. Chomsky Normal Form with two non-terminals each, so it's a binary tree.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to look for end-entric productions.\n\nWait, perhaps the string could be checked by starting with S and building from the top down, splitting into NT0 and NT4, each of which needs to be generated.\n\nBut alternatively, since this is a question of whether the string can be generated, maybe a bottom-up approach would work, trying to reduce the string's tokens to the start symbol.\n\nBut that's complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if each part of the string can be derived from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the grammar may be ambiguous, but perhaps the string is a linear combination of the derived strings of NT0 and NT4.\n\nSo let's see. NT0 and NT4 are both non-terminals.\n\nThe string starts with t33, which is either from NT0 \u2192 't33' or NT4 \u2192 't33'. But NT4 cannot start with t33 because NT4's production is NT8 NT6, which can't directly produce 't33'. Wait, no. Wait, NT4 can produce 't33' if one of the productions for NT4 directly has 't33' as a terminal.

{"custom_id":"request-478","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is helpful because it has a specific structure that makes parsing easier, though I might not need a parser for this. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the string to evaluate is: `t79 t8 t43 t13 t20 t11 t84 t9 t23 t17 t20 t80 t60 t8 t7 t37 t80 t9 t28 t26 t23 t7 t17 t62 t9`.\n\nI should note that all these tokens seem to be terminal symbols because they directly correspond to specific non-terminal productions. The grammar consists of a series of non-terminals (like S, NT0 to NT9, etc.) that each produce other combinations of non-terminals and terminals. Each production is a single non-terminal producing two others, fitting the CNF structure.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that many of the non-terminals directly map to terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't23', NT2 -> 't7', and so on. So the approach here is to try to parse the string by breaking it down into smaller parts, matching the terminals and seeing if they can be generated by the grammar.\n\nI can start by looking for chunks of terminals that correspond to the productions. Let's list out all the terminals in the string to get a sense of what we're dealing with. The terminals are: t79, t8, t43, t13, t20, t11, t84, t9, t23, t17, t20, t80, t60, t8, t7, t37, t80, t9, t28, t26, t23, t7, t17, t62, t9.\n\nStarting from the top of the grammar, S -> NT0 NT4. So S produces two non-terminals: NT0 and NT4. Each of these needs to be expanded until we reach terminals.\n\nLooking at NT0 in the grammar, it has several productions. One of them is NT0 -> 't23'. So that's one terminal. Then there's NT4 in S, which is another non-terminal.\n\nLooking at NT4, it has several productions, including NT4 -> 't37', which is another terminal. Then, there's NT4 -> 't43', which is another terminal. Wait, but in the string, after t37 comes t80, t9, etc. Hmm, maybe I should try to see if the entire string can be broken down starting from S.\n\nWait, another approach: since each production is left to right and each step produces two symbols, the string's length and the way it's split might help. Let's count the number of tokens in the string: I count 26 terminals. Starting with S, each application of a production adds two symbols, so the length should be a power of 2.\n\nWait: the length here is 26, which is not a power of 2. 2^5=32, 2^4=16. 26 isn't a power of 2, so that's a problem. Because each production in CNF increases the number of symbols by one, starting from one symbol, the total number of symbols should be 2^k. So if the original grammar produces a string, the length must be a power of two. But our string has 26 tokens, which is not a power of two. Therefore, the answer must be 'No' because the string can't be generated by the grammar, regardless of other checks.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount the string: t79 t8 t43 t13 t20 t11 t84 t9 t23 t17 t20 t80 t60 t8 t7 t37 t80 t9 t28 t26 t23 t7 t17 t62 t9. That's indeed 26 tokens. Hmm, so if the grammar starts with one symbol, each production replaces it with two, so the number of symbols should start at 1, then 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. 26 isn't any of these. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be generated by the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again. Let's count each token:\n\n1. t79\n2. t8\n3. t43\n4. t13\n5. t20\n6. t11\n7. t84\n8. t9\n9. t23\n10. t17\n11. t20\n12. t80\n13. t60\n14. t8\n15. t7\n16. t37\n17. t80\n18. t9\n19. t28\n20. t26\n21. t23\n22. t7\n23. t17\n24. t62\n25. t9\n\nSo 25 tokens. Wait, I think I might have miscounted earlier. Let me recount using commas:\n\nThe string is: `t79 t8 t43 t13 t20 t11 t84 t9 t23 t17 t20 t80 t60 t8 t7 t37 t80 t9 t28 t26 t23 t7 t17 t62 t9`\n\nBreaking it down token by token:\n\n1. t79\n2. t8\n3. t43\n4. t13\n5. t20\n6. t11\n7. t84\n8. t9\n9. t23\n10. t17\n11. t20\n12. t80\n13. t60\n14. t8\n15. t7\n16. t37\n17. t80\n18. t9\n19. t28\n20. t26\n21. t23\n22. t7\n23. t17\n24. t62\n25. t9\n\nYes, that's 25 tokens. So 25 is not a power of two either. 16 is 2^4, 32 is 2^5. 25 is in between, so it's not a power of two. Therefore, regardless of other checks, the string's length doesn't match what the grammar can produce, so the answer must be 'No'.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the grammar starts with S, which is one symbol. Each production in CNF doubles the number of symbols. So the possible lengths after each step are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. Since 25 isn't in this list, the string can't be generated.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string has 25 tokens, which is not a power of two.

Since it's CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol which can have one non-terminal or a terminal. Looking at the grammar rules, the start symbol is S, and its production is S -> NT0 NT4. So the entire string should be derivable starting from S.\n\nNext, the string is a sequence of terms like t69, t12, etc. Each term corresponds to a terminal symbol, so I need to see if these terminals can be produced by the non-terminals through a series of derivations.\n\nI notice that the grammar uses a lot of rules where non-terminals produce pairs of other non-terminals. For example, S -> NT0 NT4, and NT0 and NT4 have their own production rules. So, each step in the derivation might involve expanding non-terminals into pairs, and so on, until all the symbols are terminals.\n\nTo check if the string can be derived, I can try to find a way to parse it by breaking it down into non-terminals. Alternatively, I can use the fact that in CNF, the derivation tree corresponds to a parse tree where each production splits into two subtrees, and the depth of the tree corresponds to the number of symbols in the string.\n\nThe given string has 24 tokens (counting spaces as separations). Each production in CNF can potentially add two symbols, but since we start from S, which is two non-terminals, the minimal number of symbols for a string of length n is 2^(k), where k is the number of steps. Hmm, no, wait\u2014that's for when the string is built by always having non-terminals split into two. But that's not the case here because some non-terminals can produce terminals.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in CNF, each production has exactly two non-terminals on the right. So each expansion increases the number of symbols by one each time a non-terminal is expanded. For example, S -> A B. Then A and B can each be expanded further. So if A and B are non-terminals, the next step would produce A' B' where each could be a non-terminal or terminal, adding two each time.\n\nBut in this case, some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT2 -> 't7', etc. So perhaps it's better to approach this by working top-down or bottom-up. Since the string is given, perhaps a bottom-up approach where I check if each terminal and the following ones can be formed by the grammar.\n\nLet me list the terminals in the string: t69, t12, t43, t62, t44, t11, t15, t2, t61, t8, t77, t33, t7, t10, t22, t33, t80, t51, t83, t62, t53, t43, t8, t8, t8.\n\nI think going bottom-up might be tedious, but perhaps I can represent the string as a target and see if it can be produced.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the grammar is a context-free grammar, and thus the set of derivations forms a parse tree. We can use a recursive descent parser approach or try to see if the string can be broken down by matching the grammar rules' left-hand sides.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two non-terminals, so each expansion step replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals or a terminal. So the structure of the string is such that each symbol in the string is a result of a series of such expansions.\n\nBut given the complexity, it might be easier to use a parser generator or simulate the parsing process.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for all possible productions that can lead to the terminals. Let's try to find if each terminal in the string can be matched by some production.\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT0 -> t23, etc.\n- NT2 -> t7, etc.\n- And so on.\n\nBut the approach should be to build the parse tree starting from the target string and checking if each part can be matched by the grammar rules.\n\nLet me try to break the string down.\n\nStarting from the entire string, see if any non-terminal's production matches a substring, then split the string and check the two parts.\n\nWait, but the string is quite long. Instead, perhaps a better approach is to look for the start symbol S and see if the entire string can be generated from S.\n\nBut since the start symbol is S -> NT0 NT4, the first two symbols (NT0 and NT4) must be derived from NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals on the right. So S produces NT0 NT4, meaning in the derivation tree, S has two children: NT0 and NT4. Each of these can produce more symbols, and so on until we reach terminals.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal in the string must come from a production that eventually terminates.\n\nBut the problem is that the given string has 24 terminals, and each production step can generate two symbols. So the total number of symbols when starting from S is 2^k, where k is the number of steps.\n\nWait, but 24 is not a power of 2. Closest power of 2 is 16 (2^4), and 32 (2^5). So 24 is not a multiple of 2 in a way that fits the binary expansion. So this might suggest that the string cannot be generated because 24 is not a power of 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe that's not the case because some of the productions might continue to split into non-terminals without terminating, allowing for variable lengths.\n\nBut wait, in CNF, each production is two non-terminals. So as you go deeper, each step divides a non-terminal into two others, so the total number of symbols increases until some non-terminals produce terminals.\n\nWait, for example, to get a string of length n, you need the starting point to expand to 2^k symbols, but some of them might be terminals which stop the expansion.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think that the number of symbols generated by a grammar in CNF is of the form 2^k, but the string here is 24, which is not a power of two. 2^4=16, 2^5=32, so 24 is in between. Therefore, it's impossible for a string of length 24 to be generated by a grammar in CNF because the number of symbols must be a power of two.\n\nWait, is that correct? Or is that an oversimplification?\n\nIn a CFG without any rules that produce a single terminal, the number of symbols would be 2^k. But in our case, the grammar allows for terminals to be produced, but each production must split into two symbols at each step until a terminal is reached.\n\nWait, no, actually, in CNF, each production has two non-terminals, so each non-terminal must produce two symbols. So the process is not about the total string length, but about the parse tree. Each non-terminal at the top level splits into two parts, then each of those splits again, until you reach leaves which are terminals.\n\nBut if some of those splits produce terminals, then the total number of symbols in the string is the number of leaves in the parse tree, which is exactly 2^k, where k is the number of splits. So any string generated must have a length that's a power of 2.\n\nBut the given string has 24 symbols, which is not a power of 2. So it's impossible for it to be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take an example: Suppose S -> A B. A -> t0 t1. B -> t2 t3. So the string would be t0 t1 t2 t3, length 4, which is 2^2. If A and B further split into more non-terminals, each split doubles the number of symbols. So each time you have more splits, the length is 2^k.\n\nTherefore, any string generated by a grammar in CNF must have length equal to 2^k for some k. The given string is 24, which is not a power of two, so it's impossible.\n\nSo the answer should be 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nThe given string has 24 tokens, which is not a power of two. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, the number of symbols in any generated string must be a power of two.

{"custom_id":"request-495","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or with a terminal being a single symbol.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of 't' followed by numbers, like 't67 t9 t57 t2 t53 t83 t7 t69 t77 t43 t3 t51 t7 t44 t52 t33 t53 t80 t80 t77 t28 t8 t15 t52 t27 t7'. Since all the symbols are terminals, I'll need to see if this string can be derived through the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the grammar's production rules. The main start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So the string must start with NT0 followed by NT4. But in the string, the first symbol is t67. I need to see which NT0 or NT4 productions can lead to 't67'.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see that NT0 can produce things like NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, etc. Also, some NT0 productions lead directly to terminals. For example, NT0 -> 't23', 't28', etc. I need to check if any of these can produce 't67'.\n\nLooking through the NT0 productions, yes, I see one production is NT0 -> 't67'. So, the first part 't67' can be matched by NT0. That's a starting point.\n\nNext, the string starts with t67, which matches NT0. Now, the rest of the string should follow. The next symbol is t9, which is part of NT4. Let's look at NT4's productions. NT4 can produce NT5 NT2, NT8 NT6, and others. Also, NT4 -> 't37', 't32', etc. So I need to see if t9 can be produced by NT4.\n\nWait, looking at the NT4 productions, I don't see a production where NT4 directly produces t9. Let me check. The NT4 productions include NT4 -> 't37', 't5', 't8', 't43', etc. Wait, actually, I see NT4 -> 't9' as a production. No, let me check again. Wait, looking through the list:\n\nWait, in the list, I see NT4 -> 't37', 't5', 't27', 't8', 't43', 't9', etc. So yes, NT4 has a production NT4 -> 't9'. So that's how we get t9 as the second symbol.\n\nWait, but wait: The string is t67 t9 t57 t2 t53 t83 t7 t69 t77 t43 t3 t51 t7 t44 t52 t33 t53 t80 t80 t77 t28 t8 t15 t52 t27 t7.\n\nSo after t67 (NT0), the next symbol is t9 (NT4). So NT4 must derive to t9, which is fine because NT4 can go directly to t9. So that's the second symbol.\n\nNow, the third symbol in the string is t57, which comes after t9. Let's see what comes after NT4. Since NT4 -> t9, the production for NT4 would be matched here. So after NT4, which is t9, the next part would be NT6, I think. Wait, no. Wait, S starts with NT0 NT4, so once NT4 is consumed by t9, it's part of the string, but then we have to look at the next part.\n\nWait, no. The entire string is a sequence of t symbols, each generated by a production. So the entire string is a single sentence, a sequence of symbols, some of which are from NT rules and some from terminals.\n\nBut wait, actually, the string is part of the leftmost derivation. So the grammar is a context-free grammar in CNF, so each production replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals until terminals are reached.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to parse the string from left to right using the given grammar, applying productions in a way that matches each symbol.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\n1. The entire string is: t67 t9 t57 t2 t53 t83 t7 t69 t77 t43 t3 t51 t7 t44 t52 t33 t53 t80 t80 t77 t28 t8 t15 t52 t27 t7.\n\nWe know that the start symbol is S, which goes to NT0 NT4. So the first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So the string starts with NT0, then NT4.\n\nBut in the string, the first symbol is t67, which is a terminal. So we can only match NT0 -> t67, which is one of its productions.\n\nSo after matching the first symbol (t67), we're left with the string: t9 t57 t2 t53 t83 t7 t69 t77 t43 t3 t51 t7 t44 t52 t33 t53 t80 t80 t77 t28 t8 t15 t52 t27 t7.\n\nNow, since S is split into NT0 followed by NT4, the next symbol is t9, which must match the production of NT4. As before, NT4 can directly go to t9, which matches the second symbol.\n\nSo now, we have consumed t67 and t9, and the remaining string is t57 t2 t53 t83 t7 t69 t77 t43 t3 t51 t7 t44 t52 t33 t53 t80 t80 t77 t28 t8 t15 t52 t27 t7.\n\nThe next symbol is t57. Now, we're looking at the next NT4 (since after S's NT0 is NT4, but NT4 was already consumed by t9). So after processing t9, the next in the string is t57, which needs to be matched by the next NT0. Wait, no, because the split is NT0 followed by NT4. So after the initial S->NT0 NT4, we process NT0, then NT4, then their derivations.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the string as a series of replacements. So initially, we have to derive the string from S.\n\nBut another approach could be to look for the structure of the string in terms of the grammar's productions. Let's start from the top.\n\nThe string starts with t67. As the first character, t67 must be produced by NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see that NT0 can produce 't67' directly. So that's the first step.\n\nAfter that, the next symbol is t9, which is produced by NT4. NT4 can produce 't9' directly.\n\nSo far, the string would be t67 t9.\n\nNow, after both NT0 and NT4 have been consumed by t67 and t9 respectively, the next symbol is t57, which needs to be the result of the derivations happening after that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the structure. Let's think again: the string is a single derivation, not a parse tree. So the entire string is a leftmost derivation of the grammar.\n\nBut the grammar in CNF means that each step replaces a single non-terminal with two non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is generated by the leftmost derivations.\n\nBut perhaps an alternative approach is to consider that the string is a concatenation of the sequences generated by NT0 and NT4, but that might not be accurate. Since both are part of S, the entire string would be a combination of the derivations of NT0 and NT4 interleaved.\n\nWait, no, because S is NT0 NT4, so the derivation would start with S -> NT0 NT4, and then each non-terminal would be expanded until we reach only terminals.\n\nSo the entire string is a single leftmost derivation starting from S.\n\nTherefore, the string is a sequence of terminals, each derived by a production from a non-terminal.\n\nSo the entire string is built from the replacements of S into two non-terminals, then those into more non-terminals, and so on, until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nSo the process would look like:\n\nS (non-terminal) -> NT0 NT4\n\nThen NT0 is replaced by some sequence, and NT4 is replaced by another sequence, but in the same derivation, the leftmost non-terminals are replaced first.\n\nSo the entire string is a concatenation of the sequences generated by the leftmost derivations of NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, but this might not be the case because NT0 and NT"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-497","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. Since it's in CNF, each production rule has exactly two non-terminals on the left and two on the right, except for the starting symbol, which might produce two terminals directly. Wait, no, in CNF, each production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and also the start symbol can produce a terminal immediately. Or actually, no\u2014the start symbol can produce two terminals because in CNF, a production can be A \u2192 \u03b1 where \u03b1 is a terminal, or A \u2192 BC where B and C are non-terminals. Wait, no\u2014typically, CNF requires productions to have one non-terminal on the left and exactly two non-terminals on the right. Or alternatively, in some cases, the start symbol can directly produce a terminal if the string can consist of a single terminal. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that, but perhaps it's better to just focus on the structure of the grammar given.\n\nLooking at the grammar, all the rules are of the form NTX \u2192 NTY NTZ, which means each production replaces a non-terminal with two other non-terminals. However, some of the rules are direct terminals, like NT2 \u2192 't14'. So each rule either has two non-terminals on the right side or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t74 t81 t27 t23 t33 t20 t13 t43 t14 t72 t76 t47 t20 t70 t8 t31 t61 t14 t47 t60 t84 t54 t62 t14 t7 t43`\n\nThat's 25 tokens, all terminals of the form 't##', like t14, t23, etc. Each of these seems to correspond to a production rule in the grammar. So my first thought is to map each 't' token back to its corresponding production.\n\nI'll start by trying to parse the string step by step, applying the productions in reverse, starting from the start symbol.\n\nThe start symbol is S. Looking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the production splits into two parts, which can be thought of as left and right halves that need to be generated. So, to generate the string, we need S to split into two non-terminals, say A and B, and then each of A and B must generate the respective halves of the string.\n\nLet's split the string into two parts. The string is 25 tokens long, so the middle is around 12-13 tokens. Let's see:\n\nFirst 12 tokens: t74 t81 t27 t23 t33 t20 t13 t43 t14 t72 t76 t47\n\nThe remaining 13 tokens: t20 t70 t8 t31 t61 t14 t47 t60 t84 t54 t62 t14 t7 t43\n\nBut wait, that's an odd split, maybe 12 and 13. Alternatively, I can try different splits as per the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, the start symbol S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So according to the grammar, S splits into NT0 and NT4. So the left part should expand to the first section of the string, and the right part to the second. Alternatively, the string could be generated by combining the expansions of NT0 and NT4 in some order, but in reality, since S is a chain of productions, the order in which the non-terminals expand would affect the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the entire string as a concatenation of terms that must come from the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to map each 't' token back to its production rule. For example, looking at the grammar, each 't##' corresponds to the right-hand side of a production. So for example, looking for 't74', I need to find which production has 't74' on the right side.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, each 't#' is on the right side of a production. So each token in the string corresponds to a production rule where that token is on the right side.\n\nSo, starting from the left, I can model the expansion by decomposing the string into the constituent productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a derivation. Starting from S, we can expand S into NT0 and NT4, and then each of these can expand further. The process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nBut given the string is quite long, 25 tokens, and the grammar is complex, perhaps I can try to reverse-engineer the string by trying to build up from the terminals, seeing if they correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me go through the string token by token and see if each can be matched to a production's right-hand side.\n\nBut perhaps that's going to take too long. Alternatively, given the size, perhaps I can consider the properties of the grammar.\n\nWait, another approach: Each non-terminal in the grammar has multiple production rules, sometimes with overlapping possibilities. For instance, NT0 has several productions, each leading to two non-terminals. So when expanding, each NT0 can split into different paths.\n\nBut the string is a list of terminals, so to confirm it's generated, the entire string must be a sequence generated by expanding the grammar's non-terminals into terminals, without any non-terminals left.\n\nSo perhaps I should model this as a tree or a derivation, but given the string length, that's impractical. Alternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm for CFG parsing could be an option. However, since the grammar and the string are both given, and I'm supposed to end with 'Yes' or 'No', maybe I can find a way to see if each token in the string is compatible with the grammar's productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I can list all the production rules for each non-terminal to see if the 't' tokens correspond.\n\nSo, starting with NT0:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has several production rules. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. So each of these right-hand sides consists of two non-terminals.\n\nSo, in the string, each token must be part of such a pair, meaning the generated string would be segments where each pair of non-terminals expands into a 't##' token.\n\nWait, but the entire string is one string of terminals, which would imply that all the non-terminals have been expanded into terminals, so the string should be composed of the right-hand sides of the productions, concatenated in order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can process the string from the beginning, trying to split it into pairs of 't's that can be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but each production's right-hand side has two non-terminals, unless the production is S, which produces two non-terminals. So the entire string is a sequence of terms generated by the productions, where each production contributes one or two terminals, but in this grammar, the only terminals are in the right-hand sides, so perhaps the string is built by concatenating the generated 't#' tokens.\n\nWait, but perhaps each 't#' is generated by a single production, either directly or via non-terminals expanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string must be a concatenation of the right-hand sides of the grammar's productions. So, each 't#' must be present in a production's right-hand side.\n\nBut since the string is 25 tokens, perhaps each is a separate production, but I'm not sure, given that the grammar's producing two non-terminals each time (except maybe the start symbol), so perhaps the string must be built by a sequence of pairs, each corresponding to the right-hand side of a production.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is the concatenation of certain productions, each contributing one token to the string.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to model this as a series of transitions where each step involves expanding a non-terminal into two others, until the leaves are terminals.\n\nBut given the string's length, it's challenging without automating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check for each 't#' token if it appears as a right-hand side of any production, since each 't#' must be generated by some production.\n\nLooking through the grammar, let's list all 't#' tokens in the string. Let's extract them:\n\nt74, t81, t27, t23, t33, t20, t13, t43, t14, t72, t76, t47, t20, t70, t8, t31, t61, t14, t47, t60, t84, t54, t62, t14, t7, t43.\n\nEach of these tokens must be part of a production's right-hand side.

The string is a sequence of symbols, and I need to decide if it can be derived from the start symbol S using the production rules provided.\n\nFirst, I'll recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. A CFG is in CNF if every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, it almost seems to be in CNF. Most of the productions are A \u2192 BC, except for some that have A \u2192 a, like NT2 \u2192 't14' and a few others where a terminal is present, like NT9 \u2192 't43', etc.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the given string and see if each token in the string can be derived using the productions of the grammar. The string given is:\n\nt33 t14 t35 t26 t10 t8 t22 t9 t53 t40 t5 t20 t47 t62 t14 t54 t43 t42 t11 t27 t22 t33 t20 t77 t70 t83 t11\n\nI notice that each token like t33, t14, etc., are terminals. So each of these must be directly produced by one of the non-terminals in the grammar. My task is to check if each terminal in the string can be derived from the non-terminals in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by trying to map each terminal to a non-terminal that produces it directly. For instance, 't33' is a terminal, so we check which non-terminals have 't33' in their productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't72', 't76', 't39', 't10', 't70', etc. Wait, no, actually, 't33' appears in several NT productions. For example:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT5 \u2192 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't31', etc.\n\nWait, looking more carefully, I see that NT4 has a production to 't32' and 't5', among others. Let me go through each terminal in the string and see if it's produced by any non-terminal.\n\n1. t33: Looking at the grammar, NT5 \u2192 't33' is one of the productions. So NT5 can produce 't33'. So that's possible.\n\n2. t14: NT2 \u2192 't14' is a production. So yes, NT2 can produce 't14'.\n\n3. t35: Looking at the grammar, I don't immediately see NT35, but perhaps 't35' is produced by some NT. Let me check. Wait, looking at the grammar, I don't see an NT that directly produces 't35'. Hmm, maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, let me re-examine. The grammar has several NT productions that result in terminals. For example, look at NT0 \u2192 't23', NT5 \u2192 't27', etc. But I don't see 't35' appearing as a direct production. Maybe I missed it.\n\nWait, no. Let me scan through the list. I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't43', 't62', 't83', 't21', 't28', etc.\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't47', 't5', 't33', etc.\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't13', 't43', etc.\n\n- NT14 is not a non-terminal; 't14' is directly produced by NT2 \u2192 't14'.\n\nWait, but the string starts with 't33 t14 t35...'. So t35 isn't directly produced by any non-terminal in the grammar, as per the list provided. That could be a problem because if a terminal doesn't appear in any production as a direct result, then it cannot be derived.\n\nSo, let's check the grammar again. I might have overlooked it. Let's go through each production where a terminal is the result.\n\nLooking at all the rules:\n\nNT7 \u2192 NT14? Wait, no, the rules are:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT2 \u2192 't14'\n\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n\n- NT8 \u2192 't21'\n\n- NT4 \u2192 't84'\n\n- NT7 \u2192 't43'\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72', 't76', etc.\n\nYes, in the grammar, 't35' isn't present as a direct production. So if the string has 't35', and there's no production for that terminal, then the string cannot be generated by this grammar because there's no way to derive 't35' from the non-terminals.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 'No' because there's a terminal in the string that is not directly produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that I haven't missed any rule that produces 't35'. Scanning through all the productions, I don't see any NT \u2192 't35'. So unless 't35' appears indirectly through some non-terminal that can derive it, which isn't the case here because the grammar only directly produces certain terminals.\n\nThus, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nSo the conclusion is 'No'.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The goal is to see if the string provided can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is a series of 't' tokens with numbers, like 't11 t27 t28 ...'.

Since the grammar is in Chomsky normal form, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, so the parse tree will have binary branching and terminals as leaves.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT4. So the root of the tree is S, and it splits into NT0 and NT4. Each of these needs to be expanded.\n\nNT0 has several rules. One is NT0 -> NT6 NT7. Let's see which of these paths might help.

Hmm, context-free grammars can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) typically has rules where each non-terminal on the left side of the arrow expands into two non-terminals on the right side. Some rules might also have a terminal on the right, but in this case, it looks like everything is either a non-terminal or a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I notice that the start symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So everything ultimately depends on generating from S and breaking it down through the non-terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is `t62 t28 t83 t51 t53 t61 t10 t53 t10 t53 t37 t62 t15 t76 t44 t60 t79 t70 t8 t26 t32 t3 t26 t44 t2 t17 t10 t7`.\n\nWait, that's a lot of tokens. Each token is a terminal symbol like 't62', 't28', etc. So I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best approach is to reverse engineer this. Let me see what the string starts with and see which rules might generate 't62' first. Looking at the non-terminals that produce 't62', I see in the grammar that NT0 -> 't62' and also NT4 -> 't51', which could lead to 't62' if another part produces 't51'. Wait, no, looking at the grammar, I see that 't62' is only directly from NT0 in two cases: NT0 -> 't62' and NT0 -> 't62' as part of another rule. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.\n\nWait, let me look again. The rules for NT0 are:\n\n1. NT0 -> 't62'\n2. NT0 -> 't23' (from the last line)\n3. NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n4. NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n\nSo 't62' can be directly produced by NT0, or through other combinations. Given that the string starts with t62, the first step would likely be to use the rule NT0 -> 't62'.\n\nSo the string starts with t62, which comes from NT0. Now, the remaining part of the string should be generated by whatever comes after NT0. Let's look at the string after the first t62: t28 t83 t51 t53 t61 t10 t53 t10 t53 t37 t62 t15 t76 t44 t60 t79 t70 t8 t26 t32 t3 t26 t44 t2 t17 t10 t7.\n\nNow, after t62, the next token is t28. Looking at the grammar, what produces t28? I see in NT4 -> 't28' (from the third last line of the grammar). Wait, checking the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar, I find NT4 rules where 't28' is produced. For example, NT4 -> 't28' appears once. So for t28, the rule would be NT4 -> 't28'.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, the rules are in CNF, so the left-hand side is a non-terminal, and right-hand side are two non-terminals. So 't28' would be a terminal, so how does a rule produce it? Only directly if it's at the right-hand side as a terminal. So in this case, if a non-terminal can produce 't28' directly, then yes.\n\nWait, looking back, I see:\n\nIn the grammar:\n\nNT4 -> 't28' appears as a direct production? Wait, I need to recheck. Let me list the rules that produce terminals to make sure.\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT4 -> 't37' (yes), 't54', 't84', 't9', 't28', 't74', 't84', 't9', 't32'.\n\nYes, NT4 has a rule that directly produces 't28', so that's possible.\n\nSo the next part of the string is t28, which would require the symbol after t62 to be t28, so the production path would be NT0 (which produces t62) and then another symbol that produces t28. Since NT0 is producing t62, the next step would involve breaking down NT0 further, but wait, no. Wait, the string starts with t62, which is directly from NT0, so the next symbol must come from another production. But wait, NT0 can also produce combinations like NT5 NT5, which are non-terminals. So the parsing would need to choose between different possibilities.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nThe string is a sequence of terminals, t62 t28 t83..., and each of these must be derived from the grammar. So the initial symbols must come from S, which ultimately goes through S -> NT0 NT4. So S starts the string with NT0 NT4. But in the string, the first symbol is t62, which is from NT0. So somehow, NT0 must produce t62, and the entire string must be generated as a sequence of steps from the start symbol S.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because S directly produces NT0 NT4, which would each expand into a string. So the very first symbols would be the expansion of NT0 followed by NT4. But the string starts with t62, which is a terminal, so the initial production must directly produce a terminal. But looking at the grammar, NT0 can produce t62, which is a terminal, so S -> NT0 NT4, and if NT0 produces t62, then the first symbol is t62. But NT4 itself would need to produce the remaining symbols. So the next symbols after t62 would be whatever NT4 produces.\n\nWait, but in CNF, each production step can only produce two non-terminals, so each symbol in the string is either a terminal or results from a direct production. Since the string is all terminals, each production in the derivation must either be a terminal at some point.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n   - So the string must start with the symbols generated by NT0 followed by NT4.\n\n2. The string starts with t62, which is a terminal. So for this to happen, either NT0 or NT4 must directly produce a terminal.\n\n3. From the grammar, NT0 has a rule producing 't62', so NT0 can directly produce t62.\n\n4. So the first symbol t62 comes from NT0 \u2192 t62.\n\n5. Now, after t62, the next symbols must come from the production of NT4. Because S produces NT0 and NT4, and NT0 produces t62, so the next symbol must be the start of NT4's expansion.\n\n6. Looking at the string, the next symbol after t62 is t28. So the next part is t28, which must come from NT4's production.\n\n7. Check if NT4 can produce t28 as a terminal. Looking at the grammar, yes, there's a rule NT4 \u2192 't28'. So NT4 can directly produce t28.\n\n8. Now, after t28, the next symbols are t83, t51, t10, etc., which must come from further productions of NT4. But wait, since NT4 produces t28 as a terminal, does that mean that after NT4, the expansion stops, or does it continue further?\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up here. Let me reorganize:\n\n- Each symbol in the string is a terminal, so each symbol must be generated directly by some production rule.\n\n- The initial symbol is S, which produces NT0 NT4. So the first symbol is from NT0, which must produce 't62', and the second symbol is from NT4, which must produce 't28'.\n\nBut that would mean the string starts with 't62 t28', which matches the beginning of the string. So far, so good.\n\nBut wait, the string is longer than that. After 't28', the next symbol is t83, which implies that the symbol after t28 comes from another non-terminal. But wait, NT4 is supposed to produce t28 as a terminal, so after 't28', the next symbol should come from another production of NT4. But wait, NT4's rule is to produce 't28' as a terminal. So once NT4 produces 't28', the expansion for NT4 ends, right? Because in Chomsky Normal Form, each production step is to two non-terminals.

The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which is great because each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grammar. It seems each non-terminal (like S, NT0, NT2, etc.) branches into two other non-terminals until it reaches a terminal symbol, which corresponds to 't' followed by a number. The terminals are all single symbols, each representing a specific position in the string, like 't14', 't23', etc.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't62'. So, I need to see if any non-terminal in the grammar can produce 't62'. From the productions, I see that NT3 has a production to 't62' (NT3 \u2192 't62') and another to 't69' or 't2' (but those aren't here). So, the first step is NT3 \u2192 't62'.\n\nNow, moving to the next part: the string starts with 't62', which is from NT3. Next is 't12'. Looking back, 't12' is from NT0: NT0 \u2192 't12'. So after the first symbol, we go to NT0.\n\nBut wait, each production in the grammar splits into two steps. So, starting from S, which is the start symbol, the sequence should build up the string step by step.\n\nThe string is a concatenation of symbols, each corresponding to the production steps. Each non-terminal can produce exactly two non-terminals, which in turn produce the terminals.\n\nI need to model this as a parse tree where each step combines two symbols into the parent.\n\nLet me try to parse the string in parts.\n\n1. The first symbol is 't62', which comes from NT3 \u2192 't62'. So, the first non-terminal is NT3.\n\n2. Before 't62', there's nothing, so NT3 must be a leaf node, meaning it directly produces 't62' as the first symbol.\n\n3. The second symbol is 't12', which comes from NT0 \u2192 't12'. So, the next symbol in the string must be connected to NT0. So, where does NT0 fit into the tree?\n\nLooking at the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, S splits into NT0 and NT4. The first symbol is 't62', so NT3 must produce 't62'. That's the first step.\n\nBut then S is split into NT0 (producing 't12') and NT4. Now, the next symbol is 't12', so perhaps the 't12' is part of the NT4 production?\n\nWait, maybe I need to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nLet me try to parse the string step by step.\n\nThe string is: t62 t12 t26 t79 t43 t39 t33 t21 t17 t63 t43 t79 t32 t14 t44 t10 t61 t12 t63 t42 t39 t57 t43 t76 t47 t44 t67 t70.\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n1. t62\n2. t12\n3. t26\n4. t79\n5. t43\n6. t39\n7. t33\n8. t21\n9. t17\n10. t63\n11. t43\n12. t79\n13. t32\n14. t14\n15. t44\n16. t10\n17. t61\n18. t12\n19. t63\n20. t42\n21. t39\n22. t57\n23. t43\n24. t76\n25. t47\n26. t44\n27. t67\n28. t70.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo, to produce the string, we'll have a parse tree where S has two children: NT0 and NT4.\n\nEach of these NTs will expand into two further NTs, etc., until we reach the terminals.\n\nLet me try to assign each symbol in the string to the expansion steps.\n\n1. t62: This is from NT3 \u2192 't62'. So, the first NT3 in the string is 't62'. But S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, perhaps one of NT0 or NT4 is NT3. But I'm not sure yet. Let's proceed step by step.\n\n2. t12: This is from NT0 \u2192 't12'. So, the first NT0 in the string is 't12'.\n\nWait, but S splits into NT0 and NT4. So, the first symbol in the string must come from either NT0 or NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't62' from NT3, which isn't directly from NT0 or NT4. So, perhaps the NT0 expansion leads into NT3, which then produces 't62'. Let me clarify.\n\nIf NT0 can produce other NTs, which then produce more NTs until we get to 't62'.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT6\n...\n\nSo, NT0 expands into two NTs. Let's say the first expansion is NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Then each of those can expand further.\n\nBut this could get complicated. Maybe a better approach is to see if the string can be broken down into segments that correspond to the productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the CYK algorithm to parse the string according to the grammar.\n\nBut implementing CYK would require building a table, which is time-consuming. Alternatively, I can try to match the string step by step.\n\nLet me assume the string is t62 t12 t26... and see how they can fit.\n\n- The first symbol is 't62', which comes from NT3 \u2192 't62'.\n- The next symbol is 't12', which comes from NT0 \u2192 't12'.\n\nBut S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so how do we get both a 't62' and 't12' in the same parse tree?\n\nWait, that might not be possible directly. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the first NT0 (which is producing 't12') is part of the left expansion of S, and the NT4 is part of the right. But then how do we get 't62' as the first symbol?\n\nHmm, maybe the structure is more like:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nNT0 \u2192 ... \u2192 t12\n\nNT4 \u2192 ... \u2192 t62\n\nBut then the string would start with t12, not t62. But the first symbol is t62, so that can't be.\n\nSo perhaps another approach: Starting from S, we need to find a way to produce the string t62 t12..., which suggests that the initial expansion is NT0 producing t62 and NT4 producing t12. But I don't think NT0 can produce t62 directly because NT0's productions are all to other NTs, not terminals.\n\nWait, looking at the NTs:\n\nOnly NT3 has a production to 't62'. So, the only way to get 't62' is via NT3 \u2192 't62'. Therefore, the first symbol must come from NT3.\n\nBut then, who produces NT3 in the grammar? Looking at the productions, only some NTs produce NT3. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT3 \u2192 't35'\n- NT3 \u2192 't33'\n- NT3 \u2192 't10'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT3 \u2192 't59'\n- NT3 \u2192 't69'\n- NT3 \u2192 't3'\n- NT3 \u2192 't31'\n- NT3 \u2192 't51'\n- And others?\n\nWait, no, looking at the productions, I see NT3 has several productions:\n\nNT3 \u2192 't72'\nNT3 \u2192 't33'\nNT3 \u2192 't10'\nNT3 \u2192 't53'\nNT3 \u2192 't59'\nNT3 \u2192 't69'\nNT3 \u2192 't3'\nNT3 \u2192 't31'\nNT3 \u2192 't51'\nNT3 \u2192 't60"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-550","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string to evaluate is \"t44 t84 t7 t14 t60 t79 t22 t26 t62 t72 t77 t13 t10 t15 t15 t51 t11 t11 t5 t43 t43 t62 t26 t8 t27 t7 t44 t13 t42\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF means that each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar provided, all the productions seem to fit this structure except that some non-terminals might have been written multiple times, but I can see that each rule is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, which is consistent with CNF.\n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, it has some nice properties, like the fact that the length of any derivation tree for a string is directly related to the number of symbols in the string. But more importantly, the maximum fan-out is two, so each non-terminal can have at most two productions.\n\nTo check if the string is in the language, I can try to parse it using the grammar. Parsing a string with a CFG often involves building a derivation tree that matches the string from the start symbol to the string.\n\nThe string starts with \"t44\", so I need to find a production that starts with t44. Looking at the grammar, I see that \"t44\" is directly produced by NT4 via NT4 \u2192 t44, because in the grammar, under NT4, one of the rules is NT4 \u2192 t44.\n\nWait, no, let's check the grammar again. Looking through the productions, I see NT4 \u2192 t37, NT4 \u2192 t5, NT4 \u2192 t32, NT4 \u2192 t8, etc. Oh, wait, there is a rule NT4 \u2192 't44' as well? Let me check:\n\nIn the grammar provided, under NT4, I see:\n\nNT4 -> NT3 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT5 NT3\nNT4 -> NT0 NT8\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT4 NT7\nNT4 -> NT3 NT9\nNT4 -> NT4 NT9\nNT4 -> NT6 NT8\nNT4 -> NT4 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT3 NT4\nNT4 -> NT5 NT3\nNT4 -> NT3 NT6\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT6\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT3 NT3\nNT4 -> NT3 NT5\nNT4 -> NT0 NT8\nNT4 -> NT8 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT6\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT4 NT4\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT7\nNT4 -> NT7 NT6\nNT4 -> NT0 NT7\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT7 NT6\n... and so on. Oh wait, I think I might have misread earlier. It seems that the production NT4 \u2192 't44' isn't directly present. Instead, several productions produce 't' terms, like NT0 \u2192 't23', NT3 \u2192 't72', etc. So perhaps I'm mistaken about t44 being directly produced by NT4. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking through the productions, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2 again.\n- Other NT4 \u2192 NTx NTy combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake and t44 is produced by another non-terminal. Looking for 't44':\n\nYes, under NT6, there's NT6 \u2192 t43, and under NT7, NT7 \u2192 t43, and under NT3, NT3 \u2192 t31, etc. But looking for 't44', I don't see any production where a non-terminal directly produces 't44'. Hmm, perhaps I was wrong earlier. So maybe 't44' is produced by another non-terminal, perhaps a combination. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, under NT5, there's a production NT5 \u2192 't47', and under NT7, NT7 \u2192 't13'. So, perhaps 't44' comes from somewhere else. Maybe from a combination of NT4 and NTsomething.\n\nWait, perhaps the string starts with t44, but maybe that's from a production that I didn't notice. Alternatively, maybe t44 is from NT4's longer production.\n\nWait, perhaps the string has \"t44 t84\", so t44 must come from a production that starts with t44. Let me check all NT productions that could lead to t44.\n\nWait, perhaps t44 comes from NT8, as I see NT8 \u2192 t5. Or maybe from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, looking through the productions, under NT6, there's NT6 \u2192 t43. Under NT3, perhaps NT3 \u2192 t72. Not directly t44. Hmm, maybe t44 is from NT4, but in the grammar, NT4's productions don't have a direct t44 production. Wait, perhaps I missed it. Let me go through all the NT4 productions again:\n\nLooking at the NT4 productions:\n\n1. NT4 -> NT3 NT7\n2. NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n3. NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n4. NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n5. NT4 -> NT8 NT7\n6.

NT4 \u2192 ... and so on.\n\nWait, so I don't see any production where NT4 directly produces 't44'. Hmm. So perhaps t44 comes from a combination. For example, perhaps NT4 \u2192 NTx with something that leads to t44.\n\nWait, perhaps it's from NT0, which can lead to t23, but t44 isn't in there. Or perhaps it's from NT3, which can have some rules producing t44 through a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I should construct the entire derivation tree step by step. Since the problem is about a specific string, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nThe string is: t44 t84 t7 t14 t60 t79 t22 t26 t62 t72 t77 t13 t10 t15 t15 t51 t11 t11 t5 t43 t43 t62 t26 t8 t27 t7 t44 t13 t42.\n\nFirst, let's note that this is a list of tokens, so each token is a terminal or non-terminal.\n\nThe string has 33 tokens. Since each production in CNF is either a single terminal or two non-terminals, the total number of non-terminals in the derivation tree can be calculated. For a string of n terminals, the number of non-terminals is n - 1. So, 33 terminal symbols imply 32 non-terminals. But I need to see if the grammar can construct a tree that produces this.\n\nThe starting symbol is S, which is defined as S->NT0 NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-552","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens like `t23`, `t47`, etc. Let me break down how I would approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific way of structuring context-free grammars where each production is either of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. In this grammar, I see that most of the productions are of the form NTx \u2192 NTy NTz, which aligns with CNF since they produce two non-terminals. However, some productions directly produce a terminal symbol like NT0 \u2192 't23'. That seems a bit off because in CNF, terminals are usually on the right-hand side of productions, not as direct results. But the user specified the grammar in CNF, so I have to work with that.\n\nNext, the string to evaluate is `t23 t47 t60 t17 t61 t3 t47 t63 t70 t11 t17 t63 t20 t26 t62 t14 t14 t83 t23 t31 t17 t44 t3 t76 t7 t44 t43`. I need to see if this string can be generated by the given grammar. \n\nI think the best approach is to use the leftmost derivation method, expanding non-terminals step by step to see if I can reach the target string. However, the grammar is quite extensive with over 100 productions and 33 non-terminals. Starting by looking for the start symbol S:\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the initial expansion would be S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nThe string starts with `t23`, which I believe is a terminal produced by NT0 \u2192 't23'. Similarly, the second token `t47` is produced by NT4 \u2192 't47'. So, from S, we get `t23 t47`. That's a match for the first two tokens.\n\nNow, after `t23 t47`, we look for the next part of the string. The third token is `t60`. Looking at the grammar, which productions produce `t60`? I see NT9 \u2192 't60'. So, I need to see if NT0 or NT4 can produce NT9 in such a way that leads to `t60`.\n\nLooking at NT0, its productions are quite complex. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, etc. Alternatively, NT0 can directly go to 't23', which we've already used. So, after getting `t23`, the next symbol must come from NT0, which would involve more non-terminals.\n\nSo, after S \u2192 NT0 NT4, expanding NT0, we have NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. Now, NT6 can go to NT9 NT8, and so on. Let's consider how each production can lead to terminal symbols.\n\nBut wait, the third token in the string after `t47` is `t60`. So, perhaps I need to track how NT0 can produce `t60`. Looking into the grammar, do any non-terminals directly produce `t60`? Yes, NT9 \u2192 't60'. So, to get `t60`, NT9 must be a part of the derivation.\n\nLet me try to see if NT0 can lead to NT9 through some chain of productions. Let's see:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 (from the given)\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nSo, if I can get NT9 after NT0, then that would produce `t60`. Let's see the path:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT7 NT4 (since NT0 expanded into NT6 NT7)\nNow, within NT6 NT7, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8 \u2192 't60' NT8 (since NT9 \u2192 't60')\nBut wait, NT7 also has other productions, like NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, which could complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look at each step more carefully.\n\nAfter S \u2192 NT0 NT4, we need to expand NT0 and NT4 further to get the next symbols.\n\nLooking at the string: after `t23 t47`, the next token is `t60`. So, let's focus on NT0.\n\nNT0 can expand into multiple options. Let's see the first few steps:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\nNT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nSo, if I expand NT0 as NT6 NT7, and NT6 as NT9 NT8, and then NT9 as 't60', that would give us `t60` after `t47`. So far, that's three tokens: `t23 t47 t60`.\n\nContinuing, after that, the next token is `t17`. Looking at how to get `t17`, perhaps from NT3 \u2192 't17'? Wait, checking the list, there is a production NT7 \u2192 't17'. So, NT7 can produce `t17`.\n\nSo, the derivation up to this point would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT7 NT4 \u2192 NT9 NT8 NT7 NT4\n\nFrom NT9, we have `t60`, then NT8 can be expanded. Looking at NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0 \u2192 't83' and 't23' perhaps. Wait, let's see the grammar:\n\nCheck NT8 productions: NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0, BTW, wait, looking at the list:\n\nWait, looking through the grammar, for example:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\nWait, some of these don't directly produce terminals. So, NT8 can go to NT5 NT3 or NT6 NT0.\n\nWait, for example, if NT8 is expanded to NT6 NT0, and then NT6 can be expanded to NT9 NT8, and so on, leading to more non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if there's a path where NT8 can produce `t17`. Looking back, NT7 \u2192 't17' is a terminal. So, perhaps in another part of the derivation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to map out the steps step by step:\n\nCurrent derivation:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT7 NT4\n\nThen, NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8 \u2192 't60' NT8\n\nSo, now we have `t23 t47 t60` and then NT8.\n\nLooking at NT8, which is next. NT8 can be expanded to NT5 NT3 or NT6 NT0.\n\nIf we choose NT5 NT3, let's see where that goes. NT5 \u2192 't51' or 't62' perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if NT8 is expanded to NT6 NT0:\n\nSo, NT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT8 NT0\n\nWait, this seems like it would lead to more non-terminals, but maybe I'm not tracking this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each step must strictly follow the productions, so I need to find a way to expand the non-terminals to get the required terminals in sequence.\n\nAnother approach is to look for the entire string and see if it can be matched by the grammar. Each token in the string must be produced by a production, and the sequence must follow the leftmost derivations correctly.\n\nLooking at the string after the first four tokens: `t23 t47 t60 t17`, which would correspond to NT0, NT4, NT6\u2192NT9, then NT7 (since NT7 has `t17`). So, possible:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 NT6 NT7 NT4 \u2192 't60' NT7 NT4\n\nNow, NT7 \u2192 't17' \u2192 `t17` and NT4 \u2192 't47'. So, that would give `t23 t47 t60 t17 t47`. But the given string is longer, so we have to continue.\n\nBut wait, the string after `t17` is `t63`, which I don't see how that connects. Maybe I'm missing a step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after `t60`, the next terminal is `t17`, which is from NT7, and then the next `t63` is from NT7 again?\n\nWait, perhaps another way: from NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 \u2192 NT6 (which can be NT9 NT8), then NT8 can be NT5 NT3 or NT6 NT0.\n\nThis is getting quite tangled. Maybe a systematic approach is better.\n\nLet me try to consider that the string is a sequence of symbols that must be generated by"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-575","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means every production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where B and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the grammars work. Each production breaks down symbols into other symbols. The string we have is a sequence of these symbols: t62, t79, and so on. The grammar has a bunch of NTs (non-terminals) and terminals like t62, which I think are the actual tokens in the string.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 't' followed by numbers, like t62, t79, etc. The grammar's NTs include things like S, NT0, NT1 through NT9, NT2, etc. Wait, in the grammar, I see NT0, NT2, NT4, etc., and terminals like t62, t79, etc. So the grammar defines which combinations of these terminals can be generated.\n\nThe string is quite long: 33 tokens. Each production seems to involve two non-terminals on the right side. That suggests that each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others until we eventually reach the terminals, which are the t's.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One way is to try to parse the string from the start symbol S and see if I can break it down into the given sequence using the grammar rules. But the string is given as a list of terminals, so maybe I should look at the string in order and see if each part corresponds to some production.\n\nAnother approach is to see how each terminal appears in the grammar. For example, looking through the grammar, I see that certain NTs have rules that produce t's. For instance, NT3 can produce t72, t76, t53, etc. Similarly, NT4 can produce 't32', 't37', etc. So the terminals are the leaves of the parse tree, meaning that the process starts from S and after expanding all non-terminals, we get a sequence of terminals matching the string.\n\nBut the grammar is quite complex with 64 non-terminals. Starting from S, which is the start symbol, I can see that S-> NT0 NT4. So the string must start with the first non-terminal expanding to NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, but in the given string, it's t62 followed by t79, t76, etc. Let me check if t62 is produced by any NT. Looking through the grammar, I see NT0 -> 't23', 't28', 't43', 't5', 't74', 't43', etc. Oh, no, wait, 't62' isn't directly there. Let me see: \n\nLooking through the NT productions, for example, NT0 -> 't62' appears in NT5 -> 't62' and NT33. But wait, is there any NT that directly produces 't62'? Let's check line by line. \n\nYes, in the grammar, NT0 has several productions: \n\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\n...\nThen further down, I see NT0 -> 't62'. So yes, NT0 can produce 't62'. Similarly, some others may produce 't79', 't76', etc.\n\nBut how do I structure this? It's a top-down approach, starting from S, expanding step by step. Alternatively, maybe using the CYK algorithm for parsing, but that's complicated given the size of the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for the entire string to be a concatenation of terminals that can be produced by the grammar.\n\nWait, the string is: t62 t79 t76 t20 t14 t7 t37 t54 t52 t60 t26 t79 t28 t28 t83 t14 t40 t26 t23 t73 t79 t79 t43 t62 t17 t53 t14 t24 t14 t14.\n\nThat's a whole bunch of t's. Let's see which NTs can produce these.\n\nFor example, 't62' is directly produced by NT0 (NT0 -> 't62'), so that can be a leaf. Then I have 't79' which might come from NT79, but in the grammar, I don't see an NT79. Alternatively, maybe NT7 or NT9 can produce t79. Looking at the grammar, let's check where the t's come from:\n\nLooking through the productions, for example, NT3 -> 't72', 't76', 't53', 't60', etc. So NT3 can produce 't76', 't60', etc.\n\nWait, t79: looking for anywhere 't79' appears. In the grammar, I don't see NT0, NT2, NT3, etc., directly producing 't79'. Wait, perhaps it's produced through some NT. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, but assuming not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's generated via a chain of productions. For example, NT79 might be an NT, but it's not in the given grammar. Alternatively, maybe it's a miss in the question. But the user provided the grammar; so for each 't' in the string, I need to check if any NT in the grammar has a production ending with that 't'.\n\nLooking through the grammar productions:\n\nLooking for production rules where the body is 'tXXX'.\n\nFor example:\n\nNT3 -> 't53' (from line: NT3 -> 't53')\nNT3 -> 't69' (also)\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't13', 't43', 't7', etc.\nNT0 -> 't62', 't43', etc.\nNT0 also has NT0 -> NT5 NT5, which could produce more t's.\n\nLooking for t79: is there an NT that can produce 't79'? Scanning the grammar lines, I don't see any NT with a production that ends with 't79'. Hmm, that's a problem because the string contains t79, but none of the NT rules in the grammar produce t79.

Wait, line 1: S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThen looking for 't79' in the grammar productions:\n\nLooking through all the lines, none of the NTs produce 't79'. The closest is NT26? Wait, no, I don't see any NTs that directly produce 't79'. So that suggests that the string can't be generated because one of the tokens can't be produced by any rule in the grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string contains 't79', but no NT in the given grammar's productions directly produce 't79'. So it's impossible for the string to be generated.\n\nWait, but perhaps 't79' is produced via a series of non-terminals. For example, maybe through NT79, but in the grammar, no NT is defined as NT79. The given grammar only goes up to NT98, but I don't see NT79.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong lines. Let me check all the NTs production rules:\n\nLooking over all the grammar rules, I'll scan each RHS to see if any of them produce t79.\n\nFor example, NT4 -> 't32', 't37', etc.\nNT5 -> 't47', 't62', etc.\nNT6: 't83', 't43', 't77', 't21', etc.\nNT7: 't13', 't43', 't7', etc.\nNT8: 't26', etc.\nWait, no NT in the grammar's RHS produces t79.\n\nSo the string contains t79, which cannot be produced by any of the NTs.

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific form of context-free grammars where every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the grammar given, I see a mix of production rules with two non-terminals on the right side (like S \u2192 NT0 NT4) and some rules that derive a single terminal (like NT2 \u2192 't14'). Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions should either be two non-terminals or a single terminal. Hmm, some of these rules have more than two non-terminals? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, looking closer, all the productions are from non-terminals to either two non-terminals or one terminal. So that's correct for CNF. Now, the string consists of a series of t and numbers, which I assume are terminals, since they don't appear in the grammar as non-terminals. So the terminals here are like t10, t43, etc. So I'll have to map these terminals to the productions in the grammar.\n\nThe goal is to see if the string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given rules. Since the string is broken down into individual terms separated by spaces (like \"t10 t43 ...\"), each of these is a separate terminal symbol. So I need to see if the string can be generated by applying the grammar to S step by step.\n\nLet me approach this by building the derivation tree. The string is a sequence of terminals, so each terminal in the string must be the result of some production. Since all non-terminals in the grammar derive into other non-terminals or terminals, each terminal in the string should be derived from a non-terminal through a production.\n\nWait, the terminals in the grammar are like 't10', 't43', etc., which seems to be the specific strings that the non-terminals can produce. For example, NT2 \u2192 't14' is a production.\n\nSo, the plan is to trace the string from the start symbol S, breaking it down into non-terminals, and see if each step leads towards the given string.\n\nBut dealing with such a long string might be tedious, so maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be split into parts that correspond to the grammar's productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to check if each terminal in the string can be traced back through the grammar rules. Let me list all the terminals in the string: t10, t43, t63, t7, t60, t79, t70, t21, t8, t43, t53, t20, t76, t83, t57, t51, t13, t14, t2, t60, t33, t26, t11, t79, t70, t62, t79, t10, t31.\n\nEach of these needs to be a production of a non-terminal. So, for example, t14 is directly produced by NT2.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I can map each terminal to a non-terminal:\n\n- t10: I don't see a rule where a non-terminal produces t10. Let me scan through the rules again. Looking at NT0 \u2192 't23', NT5 \u2192 't5', etc. Hmm, not seeing t10. Wait, maybe it's produced indirectly. Let me check each rule where a non-terminal is set to t10.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see NT2 \u2192 't14' but not t10. Wait, perhaps none of the non-terminals directly produce t10. That can't be right. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the entire list again.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 't14', NT3 \u2192 't72', NT4 \u2192 't37', etc. I don't see any non-terminal that directly produces t10. That's a problem because t10 is in the string but there's no production that directly generates it. That would mean the string cannot be generated by this grammar, right?\n\nWait, but the string has t10 as the first term. So if there's no production that allows the start symbol S to ever produce t10, then the string cannot be generated. Let me check the productions again.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So S directly produces NT0 and NT4, which are two non-terminals. Then, each of these non-terminals needs to produce the respective terminals.\n\nBut in the string, the first term is t10, which would have to come from either NT0 or NT4. Let me see what NT0 and NT4 can produce.\n\nFrom the grammar, NT0 has several productions. Let me list them:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 (duplicate)\n- NT0 \u2192 NT7 NT0\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n- Others: NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT0, etc. Hmm, it seems NT0 can be split into multiple non-terminals, but none of its productions directly produce a terminal like t10.\n\nSimilarly, looking at NT4:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\n- NT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3 (duplicate)\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT7\n- NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7\n- Others: seems NT4 can split into non-terminals.\n\nWait, but none of these rules for NT0 or NT4 include t10 or another terminal that leads to t10. So, perhaps t10 cannot be generated by the grammar. Therefore, since the string starts with t10, it's impossible for this grammar to generate that string.\n\nWait, but let me check if any non-terminal can lead to t10. Scanning the entire grammar rules, I don't find any rule where a non-terminal directly produces t10.

The grammar seems a bit complex with a lot of production rules, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky normal form (CNF) entails. CNF requires that every production rule be of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the provided grammar, it seems to fit this structure, with only two types of productions: those that produce two non-terminals and those that produce terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t10 t77 t79 t77 t28 t7 t53 t10 t70 t31 t76 t7 t79 t28 t63 t26 t76 t63 t51 t7 t33 t14 t57 t8 t67 t43 t74 t53 t57 t56 t43`.\n\nI need to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S using the given grammar. Let's map out the string into individual tokens since each appears to be a terminal symbol (like t10, t77, etc.).\n\nStarting with the string, let's count the tokens: 30 in total. I should figure out if each token can be reached through some production rules starting from S, considering how the grammar expands.\n\nFirst, looking at the start symbol S, which is defined as S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the initial expansion starts with NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, let's examine NT0 and NT4 and their possible expansions:\n\nNT0:\n- It has several production rules. Some lead to NT0 NT5, some to NT6 NT7, others to NT9 NT7, etc. For example, looking at NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, which could help in deriving further non-terminals.\n\nWait, the given string starts with t10. Which production leads to t10? Looking through the grammar, I notice some rules that produce t10. For NT0, there's a rule NT0 \u2192 NT10 NTsomething? Wait, no, I don't see a direct NT0 \u2192 t10. Instead, some non-terminals expand into terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look through the grammar for rules that produce t10. Scanning through the rules:\n\nLooking at the non-terminals:\n\n- NT0 appears in several rules, but most expand to non-terminals. However, I don't immediately see a rule producing t10. Wait, looking more carefully:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT3:\n\n- NT3 has some rules like NT3 \u2192 t76, which might be relevant, but not t10.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing it. Maybe t10 is produced by another non-terminal. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the rules, I see that under NT3, there's a production NT3 \u2192 t76, among others. So, maybe t10 isn't directly produced, but perhaps through a chain.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of trying to reverse engineer the entire derivation, perhaps I can use the fact that the grammar is in CNF and apply the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm to determine if the string is in the language.\n\nThe CYK algorithm is suitable for context-free grammars in CNF. It's a dynamic programming method that checks whether each substring of the input can be derived from the start symbols using the productions.\n\nSo, the CYK algorithm steps would involve:\n\n1. Parsing the string into tokens.\n2. Creating a table where each cell (i,j) represents the range of indices from i to j.\n3. For each cell, checking if the substring from i to j can be derived using any production rule starting from non-terminals.\n4. If all cells are covered and the entire string can be derived from S, then the string is in the language.\n\nGiven the string has 30 tokens, this could be quite involved, but let's proceed.\n\nBut wait, the number is manageable. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\nFirst, the string S = [t10, t77, t79, t77, t28, t7, t53, t10, t70, t31, t76, t7, t79, t28, t63, t26, t76, t63, t51, t7, t33, t14, t57, t8, t67, t43, t74, t53, t57, t56, t43].\n\nBut the counts don't match; I initially thought there were 30 tokens, but let me recount:\n\n1: t10\n2: t77\n3: t79\n4: t77\n5: t28\n6: t7\n7: t53\n8: t10\n9: t70\n10: t31\n11: t76\n12: t7\n13: t79\n14: t28\n15: t63\n16: t26\n17: t76\n18: t63\n19: t51\n20: t7\n21: t33\n22: t14\n23: t57\n24: t8\n25: t67\n26: t43\n27: t74\n28: t53\n29: t57\n30: t56\n31: t43\n\nWait, that's 31 tokens. I must have miscounted earlier. So the string has 31 tokens, which is a bit more, but still manageable.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact non-terminal productions and which terminals they produce, it's challenging to apply CYK manually. Alternatively, perhaps I can attempt to find a derivation path step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for the presence of certain terminals that might indicate the required non-terminals that can produce them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if the string can be split into segments that match the non-terminal productions.\n\nBut given the complexity, I might need a more strategic approach.\n\nFirst, let's note that the grammar includes a start symbol S, which produces NT0 and NT4. So, S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, let's check what NT0 and NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT0, it has several rules, such as NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7, etc. For NT4, the rule is NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6.\n\nSo, the initial step would be:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4 \u2192 (something) (something else)\n\nBut without knowing what NT0 and NT4 derive into, it's tricky. However, perhaps the string starts with t10, so let's see if t10 can be produced by some non-terminal.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice NT3 \u2192 t76, but nothing directly producing t10. Wait, perhaps I missed a production.\n\nWait, let's check all the rules again:\n\nLooking for rules that produce t10.\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nI see NT2 \u2192 t7, which could be relevant when considering t7 tokens later.\n\nLooking deeper, under NT3:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't76', 't53', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Maybe t10 is produced by NT0 through a series of productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a long chain. Let's think recursively: if the first token is t10, how does that come from S?\n\nSince S produces NT0 and NT4, perhaps t10 comes from NT0.\n\nLooking at NT0 productions, one of them is NT0 \u2192 NT10 NTsomething? Wait, no, the rules for NT0 are all two non-terminals, except some that go to terminals indirectly.\n\nWait, no, perhaps t10 is produced by NT0 through a chain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the token t10 is produced by NT0 via multiple steps. For example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, then NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, and so on, until a terminal is reached.\n\nBut without knowing the exact production rules that result in t10, it's difficult to say. Alternatively, perhaps the string has a part that corresponds to a known production chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can trace back from the string and see if it can be split into parts that match the grammar.\n\nLet me try to split the string into segments that might correspond to NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe string starts with t10, which might come from NT0. Then t77, which is another NT0\/NT4, maybe NT4 \u2192 t77?\n\nWait, looking at NT4's production: NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6. Does NT8 or NT6 produce t77?

Let me start by understanding the problem and the grammar, then figure out the best way to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grammar is given, and I can see that it's in CNF, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right side. The start symbol is S, which starts as S -> NT0 NT4. So the initial derivation starts with producing NT0 and NT4. Each of these non-terminals will expand further until we reach the terminal symbols, which are represented by 't' followed by numbers.\n\nThe string to evaluate consists of a series of terminal symbols, each being one of these 't' followed by numbers. My task is to parse this string to see if it can be derived from the grammar starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it's quite complex with many non-terminals and productions. I can see that the terminals are connected by these non-terminals in a specific way. Each non-terminal has multiple productions that break it down into other non-terminals or terminals.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the string is a sequence of terminals, I need to see if the grammar can generate this exact sequence in some order of productions. Parsing techniques like recursive descent or perhaps using a table-driven parser could work, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to reconstruct the leftmost derivation or the rightmost derivation that results in this string.\n\nBut reconstructing the entire derivation path for such a long string would be tedious. Perhaps a better approach is to look for the structure of the string and see if each 't' corresponds to the correct terminal based on the grammar's production rules.\n\nLet me analyze the string:\n\n`t62 t62 t79 t67 t77 t53 t21 t12 t43 t13 t7 t11 t28 t24 t15 t11 t33 t63 t83 t17 t11 t43 t76 t24 t7 t26 t11 t52 t81 t33 t26`\n\nBreaking it down into tokens (assuming each 't' followed by a number is a single token):\n\nToken order:\n62, 62, 79, 67, 77, 53, 21, 12, 43, 13, 7, 11, 28, 24, 15, 11, 33, 63, 83, 17, 11, 43, 76, 24, 7, 26, 11, 52, 81, 33, 26.\n\nSo, 31 tokens. Each token corresponds to a term in the production rules, and they must form a valid sequence based on the grammar.\n\nI notice that the string starts with two 62s. Let me see if 62 has any productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT8 -> NT5 NT3\nNT5 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\n...\n\nWait, but looking for NT6: the production NT6 can be found in several places, such as:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\n\nWait, actually, I should list all the productions for each non-terminal to see their possible expansions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for which non-terminals can produce which terminals or sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that in a context-free grammar, each production is applied in a certain order, and each step reduces the number of non-terminals until only terminals remain.\n\nGiven the string has 31 tokens, and since each production (except terminals) replaces one non-terminal with two non-terminals, the number of steps would increase, but the number of terminals could vary.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of non-terminals can be determined by the depth of the derivation. But given that the string is generated, each step appends two tokens, perhaps. Wait no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is a sequence of terminals, the only way the grammar can produce it is through a series of productions that collapse non-terminals into the required terminals in the correct order.\n\nBut considering the complexity of the grammar, perhaps an alternative approach is to use a parser or look at the structure of the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the start symbol S, S->NT0 NT4, so the entire string should be the result of S expanding into two components: NT0 and NT4. So the entire string should be a concatenation of the strings generated by NT0 andNT4, in that order.\n\nSo, first, the string can be split into two parts: the first part is generated by NT0, and the second part by NT4.\n\nLet me check the string:\n\nThe entire string is: t62 t62 t79 t67 t77 t53 t21 t12 t43 t13 t7 t11 t28 t24 t15 t11 t33 t63 t83 t17 t11 t43 t76 t24 t7 t26 t11 t52 t81 t33 t26\n\nLooking at the first few elements:\n\nt62, t62, t79, t67, t77,...\n\nLooking for the start of the NT0 and NT4.\n\nFrom the grammar, S starts with NT0 and NT4. So the string should first be the expansion of NT0, then followed by the expansion of NT4.\n\nLooking at the initial part, t62 t62 t79 t67 t77...\n\nHmm, t62 is a terminal, so perhaps it's part of NT0's expansion.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT0:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT7\nNT0 -> NT9 NT6\nNT0 -> NT5 NT5\n...\nSo NT0 can be expanded into various combinations of NT6, NT7, NT9, NT5.\n\nLooking at the initial tokens, t62. Let's see what each possible production for NT0 could expand to:\n\nIf NT0 expands to NT6 NT7:\n\nThen the first two tokens would be the expansions of NT6 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 can be NT7 NT9, NT0 NT2, etc. Wait, from the grammar:\n\nNT6 -> NT9 NT8\nNT6 -> NT7 NT9\nNT6 -> NT6 NT0\nNT6 -> NT6 NT2\n\nWait, no, in the given grammar, for NT6, the production options are:\n\nLooking back, I need to check each production for NT6:\n\nI see several NT6 productions:\n\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT3 NT3?

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). CNF has two restrictions: every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems to fit since all the productions are either non-terminals producing two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t12 t84 t26 t44 t60 t52 t35 t43 t51 t62 t15 t7 t28 t54 t2 t63 t17 t63 t43 t43 t47 t7 t42 t10 t80 t7 t47 t3 t47 t79 t13 t63`.\n\nI notice that the string consists of tokens like 't12', 't84', etc. Since the grammar has a bunch of productions that result in two non-terminals, I think the string is a sequence of terminals (the 't's with numbers), which suggests that it's a right-derivation where each step expands a non-terminal into two non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nNow, the approach is to parse the string from the start symbol, S, and see if each step can lead to the entire string being matched.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nSo the first two symbols should be the start of NT0 and NT4. Looking at the string, the first tokens are t12, t84, t26, etc.\n\nLet me break it down step by step:\n\n1. Parse S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n2. So the first part of the string should be NT0 being expanded, and the second part NT4.\n\nLooking at the first token 't12', which must come from NT0.\n\nWait, in the grammar, NT0 can produce various things. For example, one of the productions is NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT7, but maybe more importantly, looking at the terminal 't12', which is produced by NT3 via NT3 \u2192 't12' (looking at the production NT3 -> 't12'). Wait, no, looking back, the production is NT0 -> 't12', as per the last lines: NT0 -> 't28' and also other productions, but I need to check the full list.\n\nWait, in the given grammar, the productions for NT0 include:\n\nLooking through all NT0 productions, I see that one is NT0 -> 't28', another is NT0 -> 't43', etc. Wait, maybe I need to check all of them. Wait, looking at the provided grammar:\n\nAh, yes, looking through, I see NT0 \u2192 't23', 't28', 't43', etc. So 't12' is not directly an option for NT0. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, the user provided a long list of productions. Let me scan through all the NT0 productions:\n\nLooking for NT0 -> 't12'... I don't see that. The ones I see are:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT0 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- etc.\n\nSo none of the NT0 productions directly produce 't12'. Hmm, that's a problem because the first token in the string is 't12', which must come from NT0 if we're parsing S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\nWait, but perhaps during expansion, NT0 might eventually produce 't12' through a series of other productions. Let me check which NT can produce t12.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice a production NT0 \u2192 't12' as per one of the lines: NT0 -> 't12' (I think). Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the last part of the grammar shows:\n\nNT0 -> 't23',\nNT0 -> 't28',\nNT0 -> 't43',\nNT0 -> 't52',\nNT0 -> 't74',\nNT0 -> 't80',\nand a few others, but I don't see 't12' explicitly. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking through all the grammar lines, yes, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT0 -> 't28'\n- NT0 -> 't43'\n- NT0 -> 't52'\n- NT0 -> 't74'\n- NT0 -> 't80'\n- Also, NT0 -> 't23' via NT2's path.\n\nWait, perhaps in another part of the grammar, such as NT2 \u2192 't12'? Looking at the grammar, the production NT2 \u2192 't7' is present, and other NT2 productions, but I don't see 't12' directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't12' comes from NT6 via NT6 \u2192 't12'? Let me check NT6's productions. Looking at the grammar, I see NT6 can produce 't61', 't67', 't77', 't43', etc., but not t12. Similarly, NT1 (but wait, does NT1 exist? No, because the grammar starts with S, and other non-terminals are like NT0, NT4, etc. So maybe 't12' comes from NT9, NT3, etc.\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, I see that NT2 \u2192 't7', which is another path. Let me think, perhaps it's possible that during expansion, a non-terminal leads to 't12' through a chain of productions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me consider that the string starts with 't12', which must come from some NT. Let's check if any NT production directly produces 't12'.\n\nLooking through all NTs:\n\n- NT0: Does it have 't12'? From the list above, I don't see it. It only goes to 't23', 't28', 't43', etc.\n- NT1: I don't see NT1 in the grammar; S is the start symbol, and other non-terminals are like NT4, NT0, etc.\n- NT2:NT2 \u2192 't7' and others, but not 't12'.\n- NT3:NT3 \u2192 't24', 't39', etc., but not 't12'.\n- NT4:NT4 \u2192 't37', 't5', etc., but not 't12'.\n- NT5:NT5 can produce 't15', etc., but no 't12'.\n- NT6:NT6 can produce 't83' and 't77', etc., but not 't12'.\n- NT7:NT7 can produce 't70' and others, no 't12'.\n- NT8:NT8 \u2192 't84', etc., but not 't12'.\n- NT9:NT9 \u2192 't60' and others, but no 't12'.\n\nWait, so it seems none of the NTs directly produce 't12'. That would mean it's impossible to derive 't12' from S according to the given grammar. But wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't12' is produced via a chain of non-terminals. For example, the first NT0 in S could expand into another NT that eventually leads to 't12', but without a direct production, this might be challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in looking through all the NTs. Let me re-examine the production rules more carefully.\n\nLooking through all NT0 productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT0 \u2192 't28'\n- NT0 \u2192 't43'\n- NT0 \u2192 't52'\n- NT0 \u2192 't74'\n- NT0 \u2192 't80'\n- Also, other NTs might lead to 't12'. For example, looking at NT7, I see NT7\u2192't43' and NT7\u2192't70', but no 't12'. NT6 has 't77' and 't61' but not 't12'. NT3 has 't24' which is t24, but I'm looking for t12.\n\nWait, perhaps 't12' comes from a non-terminal that's connected via a series of productions. Maybe I need to trace back from 't12' to see if it can be reached from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach should be to try to parse the string starting from S \u2192 NT0 NT4. The first symbol should be the leftmost symbol generated by NT0. So if the first token is 't12', and if NT0 can produce 't12' somewhere in a chain, then it's possible.\n\nBut looking at the productions I listed earlier, none of the NTs directly produce 't12'.

The string is `t10 t83 t28 t39 t63 t10 t28 t24 t24 t10 t26 t67 t27 t69 t28 t2 t57 t70 t70 t5 t74 t27 t43 t15 t79 t44 t84 t52 t26 t79 t14 t28`. \n\nFirst, I notice that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. Looking at the grammar, many of the productions have been rewritten as pairs, which can sometimes make the structure a bit tricky, but it's still a proper CNF.\n\nThe string consists of various `t{n}` tokens, like `t10`, `t83`, etc. Since the grammar uses these tokens directly in some of its production rules, I think each `t{n}` corresponds to a terminal symbol. For example, I see rules like NT0 \u2192 't23', which means that when NT0 is derived, it produces the string 't23'.\n\nNow, my goal is to find a parse tree that generates the given string. I'll start by looking for the start symbol S and see if it can derive the string. The start symbol is S, which can be rewritten as NT0 NT4. So, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Both NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals that need to be expanded.\n\nLet me try to find what each part of the string can correspond to. The string begins with `t10`. Looking through the grammar rules, I can see that NT7 \u2192 't70' is a production, and similarly, other NT non-terminals have `t{n}` where n might match the parts of the string.\n\nI'll start trying to match the string step by step. Let's break the string into parts and see if they can correspond to the productions.\n\nThe string is quite long, so maybe a better approach is to see what productions can lead to each `t{n}` token in the string. Let me list the positions of each `t{n}` and see what non-terminals could produce them.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 can produce 't23', NT5 can produce 't47', NT1 can produce 't74', and so on. But since all the t{n} in the string are in the 10s, 20s, 30s, 40s, etc., perhaps they come from specific productions.\n\nWait, actually, each `t{n}` seems to be a terminal, so each `t{n}` must come directly from a production rule like NT3 \u2192 't72', which is one of the rules. So, for each `t{n}` in the string, I need to see if there's a production rule that produces it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first word is `t10`. I need to check if any of the non-terminals can produce `t10`. Looking through the grammar, I see production rules where `t10` appears on the right-hand side. For example, NT0 \u2192 't62', but that's for 't62', not 't10'. Wait, let me recheck.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake. Looking at the grammar, under the NT0 productions, I see NT0 \u2192 't23' but no 't10'. Hmm. Let me look at the other non-terminals. Maybe NT3 can produce some `t{n}`. For example, NT3 \u2192 't72', but not 't10'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the possible `t{n}` that the non-terminals can produce. Let me go through the rules:\n\nLooking through the grammar:\n- NT3 \u2192 't53', 't39', 't31', 't39', 't51', 't72', 't89'? Wait, I might be mixing up.

Let me look:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' (from line 15)\n- NT0 \u2192 't43' (line 25)\nWait, no, the lines are numbered and each has a production.

{"custom_id":"request-633","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to determine if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or A \u2192 a, where a is a terminal. Looking at the grammar, it seems all the rules are in CNF except I notice one rule is S -> NT0 NT4, which is okay because S is a non-terminal and the right side is two non-terminals. The string to evaluate is a sequence of terminals, and I need to check if it can be derived from the start symbol S.\n\nThe string given is: t24 t28 t62 t60 t15 t63 t5 t20 t52 t69 t43 t13 t63 t60 t53 t43 t70 t70 t7 t26 t7 t76 t74 t80 t43 t33 t3 t13 t20 t80 t12 t20 t9.\n\nMy approach will be to parse the string from left to right, trying to find a way to split it into the correct non-terminal expansions according to the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, the parse will be straightforward, and each step will involve matching a terminal string that corresponds to the production rules.\n\nI'll start by identifying the terminals in the string:\nt24, t28, t62, t60, t15, t63, t5, t20, t52, t69, t43, t13, t63, t60, t53, t43, t70, t70, t7, t26, t7, t76, t74, t80, t43, t33, t3, t13, t20, t80, t12, t20, t9.\n\nI'll try to break this down step by step. The start symbol is S, and S has the production S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, the first two parts of the string must come from NT0 and NT4, respectively.\n\nLet me look for t24, which should be in NT0. Scanning the string, the first token is t24. Now, what does NT0 produce? Looking at the grammar for NT0:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 or NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7 or NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6 or NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5 or ... etc.\n\nWait, no, the NT0 rules are a bit complex. Let's list the productions for NT0 as per the grammar provided:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n... and others, but I think the primary ones are the first two: NT0 can produce NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7 or NT9 NT6 or NT5 NT5.\n\nSo, for the first part, t24 is in NT0. So after the first symbol, we have t24, which is part of NT0. Since the second production of NT0 is NT6 NT7, I'll assume the first part is NT6 and the second is NT7. So after t24, the next symbol should be in NT6. The next symbol is t28.\n\nSo after t24 (NT0's first part), the next part is t28, which should come from NT6. Now, looking at NT6's productions:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT9\nNT6 \u2192 NT6 NT0\nNT6 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT9\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT0\nNT6 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT6 \u2192 NT8 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT3 NT3\nNT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8\n... others are more, but the key is, NT6's productions all consist of two non-terminals. So for t28 to be part of NT6, I need to find a production where the first production part of NT6 is t28, but looking at the grammar, all the non-terminals are like NT7, NT8, etc., not terminals.\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm making a mistake here. In the grammar, all the rules for non-terminals produce other non-terminals, except when they produce terminals, but terminal symbols are the 't' symbols in the string.\n\nSo, looking at the string, t24 is the first symbol, and it's part of NT0. So, I need to see if t24 can be derived from NT0.\n\nBut wait, looking at the grammar, NT0's productions are all to non-terminals, so t24 isn't a terminal directly in NT0's rules. Instead, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the grammar rules again.\n\nWait, looking back, the grammar rules are all in CNF, and all non-terminals produce other non-terminals. So the only way to get a terminal is if a non-terminal has a production that includes a terminal. But looking at the grammar, all the rules for the non-terminals are of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, but in the provided grammar, all the rules seem to be of the form A \u2192 BC, with no A \u2192 a. So, does that mean that the grammar doesn't have any terminals, only non-terminals? Because if that's the case, the parser can't generate any terminals unless it uses epsilon productions, which are not present here.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem gives a string with terminals like t24, so maybe the grammar actually has some terminals that I'm missing. Let me check again:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, every rule is A \u2192 BC, except that in the initial definition, S is the start symbol and produces NT0 NT4. But looking through the rules, I don't see any rule that produces a terminal symbol. All rules are from non-terminals to concatenations of non-terminals, so does that mean the language consists of only S (with rules leading to non-terminals, no terminals at all)? That would mean any string with terminals isn't in the language, so the answer would be 'No'.\n\nBut that can't be, because the string provided has terminals. So, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the grammar. Let me re-express the grammar:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, etc.\n\nThere's another production: NT2 -> 't7' So wait, looking at NT2's rules, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't7'\n\nSo, wait, in the grammar, NT2 has a production that produces the terminal 't7'. Similarly, other non-terminals have productions that produce terminals, like NT9 \u2192 't43', etc.\n\nAh, okay, so that's the case. So, many of the non-terminals have productions that directly produce terminals. For example, NT2 has NT2 \u2192 't7', which is a terminal.\n\nSo, going back, the string starts with t24.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which means each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A is a non-terminal and B and C are non-terminals or terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: t35 t80 t63 t7 t43 t57 t20 t52 t63 t60 t15 t26 t12 t44 t35 t12 t81 t61 t43 t11 t23 t7 t60 t69 t44 t33 t72 t83 t43 t28 t7 t31 t8.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the symbols in the string are terminals, not any non-terminal symbols. That suggests that the string is entirely composed of terminal symbols, meaning it's being generated by the grammar.\n\nI'll start by identifying the start symbol, which is S. The grammar starts with S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so S directly produces NT0 and NT4. For the string to be valid, the entire string must derive from S, so the first two terminals generated must be t35 and t80, which correspond to NT0 (t35) and NT4 (t80). Wait, looking back, the grammar has NT0 -> 't23' and NT4 -> 't32'. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would produce t23 t32, but the given string starts with t35 t80. That doesn't match. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nWait, perhaps I mislooked. Let me check the productions for NT0 and NT4 again. Looking at the grammar, NT0 can produce 't23', which is fixed. Similarly, NT4 might have other productions. Wait, in the grammar, NT4 has several productions, including NT4 \u2192 't37', 't5', 't8', etc. So actually, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would produce a combination of these, but the string starts with t35 and t80, which are 't80' for NT4? But wait, no\u2014looking at the productions, 't80' comes from NT4, but NT4's initial production in the grammar is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. But in the string, the first two tokens are t35 and t80, which would correspond to NT0 (t35 as per NT0 \u2192 't23'? Wait, maybe NT0 is a non-terminal and t23 is an expansion of NT0. But looking back, NT0 \u2192 't23' is one of the productions, so NT0 must derive to t23. Similarly, NT4 has several productions, including some constants and non-terminals.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the steps.\n\n1. The string starts with t35 (pos1) and t80 (pos2). These correspond to NT0 \u2192 't23' and NT4 \u2192 't32', but the string starts with t35 and t80, which don't match. So perhaps S can produce other combinations? Wait, S \u2192 NT0 NT4 is the only production, but perhaps the NT0 and NT4 are expanding into multiple non-terminals which then expand into the string.\n\nWait, maybe the string doesn't start directly with S's expansion but through a series of intermediate non-terminals. So perhaps the first step is to see if the string can be broken down starting from S.\n\nLooking at the grammar, each production is in the form of A \u2192 BC, so we can try to derive the string by breaking it down into sequences of two symbols at a time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a concatenation of symbols that can be produced by some sequence of non-terminals.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the string is a sequence of all the derived symbols. So I'll need to start from S and see if it can generate this string.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to see each symbol in the string whether they can be produced by some non-terminal. Let's check if all the symbols in the string are covered by the grammar's terminal symbols.\n\nLooking at the symbols in the string:\n\nt35, t80, t63, t7, t43, t57, t20, t52, t63, t60, t15, t26, t12, t44, t35, t12, t81, t61, t43, t11, t23, t7, t60, t69, t44, t33, t72, t83, t43, t28, t7, t31, t8.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal productions (the ones where a non-terminal directly produces a terminal symbol), here are some examples:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32' (but wait, I need to check each production correctly)\nWait, actually, let me go through the grammar step by step to find all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the grammar, any line where the right-hand side is a single terminal symbol shows the non-terminal's terminal production. For example:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT9 \u2192 't43'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT4 \u2192 't37'\n- etc.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, it's quite long.

{"custom_id":"request-651","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string is a sequence of tokenized parts, like `t79`, `t28`, etc. My task is to figure out if this string can be derived from the start symbol S of the grammar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the grammar. CNF grammars have productions where the left-hand side (LHS) is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side (RHS) consists of two non-terminals. From what I remember, any context-free grammar can be converted into CNF, but here it's already provided in that form.\n\nLooking at the start symbol S, the first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So, any string derived from S must start with two non-terminals: NT0 and NT4. Each of these can then be expanded further according to their respective productions.\n\nThe string I need to evaluate starts with `t79 t28 t33 t62 ...`. Since S produces NT0 and NT4, the first two tokens should correspond to the expansions of NT0 and NT4. Let me check the productions for NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see that it can be expanded into various combinations, either involving NT9 and NT7, NT6, etc. Similarly, NT4's productions seem to have multiple options, like NT5 and NT2, or NT4 itself with NT3, and so on. \n\nWait, but for the string to be generated, the first token after S would be either whatever NT0 produces or NT4 produces. But S is S -> NT0 NT4, so the initial expansion of S is two non-terminals. Each of these will be replaced by their respective productions.\n\nBut when I look at the string, the first token is `t79`, which suggests that the first non-terminal after expansion is producing `t79`. So, I need to check if NT0 or NT4 can produce `t79`.\n\nLooking through NT0's productions, I see some terminal symbols like `t79`, `t28`, `t33`, etc., which are the leaves in the derivation. So, NT0 can directly produce `t79` through one of its productions. For example, I see a production like NT0 -> NT5 NT5, which in turn can produce `t79` if one of the NT5's expands to `t79`. Wait, let me check that.\n\nLooking at NT5's productions, I see NT5 -> 't33', but wait, in the provided grammar, there's a production NT5 -> 't33'. So, NT5 can produce `t33` and maybe others. But does NT0 produce `t79`? Let me check NT0's direct productions.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions: I see something like NT0 -> NT9 NT7, NT0 -> NT9 NT6, but does any production of NT0 directly produce a terminal? Scanning through, I see that in the list, there's NT0 -> NT29 NT7 (Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me recheck the provided productions.)\n\nWait, let me go through the NT0 productions step by step. Here's a summary:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT0 -> NT29 NT7 (Wait, no, I don't see that. Actually, the productions for NT0 might be spread out. Let me list all NT0 productions:\n\nLooking back, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT2\n- Oh, so NT0 can be NT6 NT7 or NT9 NT7 or NT9 NT6 or NT5 NT5 or NT2 NT9 or NT9 NT2.\n\nWait, but looking through the provided rules, the terminal symbols seem to start with 't'. So, for example, NT0 can go to NT5 NT2, but that's still non-terminals. Looking deeper, I see that some NT rules directly produce terminals. For example, NT0 -> NT5 NT5, but then NT5 can produce various terminals like 't33'.\n\nWait, but in the provided grammar, under NT0, we have NT0 -> NT5 NT5, and then NT5 can produce 't33' (like NT5 -> 't33') and 't47' (NT5 -> 't47'). So, if NT0 expands into two NT5s, each of which can produce a terminal, then NT0 would produce two terminals, say 't33' and 't47'.\n\nBut in the string, the first token is `t79`. So, I need to check if any of NT0 or NT4 can directly produce `t79`.\n\nLooking back at NT0's productions, is there one that produces `t79` as a terminal? Let me go through all NT0 rules:\n\nLooking at the list, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT2\n\nI don't see any direct production where NT0 becomes a terminal like `t79`. Wait, but maybe I missed one. Let me check again. Perhaps in the middle of the list, at some point, there's a rule like NT0 -> 't79' NTsomething, but I don't see that.\n\nWait, no, looking more carefully, all of NT0's productions have NT followed by other non-terminals. So, NT0 can't directly produce a terminal symbol on its own. Therefore, to get a terminal symbol like `t79`, it must come from a non-terminal that has a production leading to a terminal.\n\nSo, looking at the string, the first token is `t79`. That must mean that either NT0 or NT4 must have a production that eventually leads to `t79`.\n\nWait, but S produces NT0 and NT4, so the first expansion from S would be NT0 first, followed by NT4. Then, the first token in the string is `t79`, which must come from the NT0 part, and the second token would come from the NT4 part.\n\nSo, perhaps the NT0 part is generating `t79` and the NT4 part is generating something else that starts with `t28`.\n\nWait, let me check NT4's productions. I see NT4 can produce NT5 NT2, or other combinations, including `t32`, `t54`, etc. Wait, looking through, I see NT4 -> 't32', 't5', etc. Let me check:\n\nLooking at NT4's productions:\n\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- And so on. Wait, no, it seems I have to check explicitly for any NT4 production that leads directly to a terminal.\n\nIn the provided rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT4 -> 't5'\n- NT4 -> 't8'\n- NT4 -> 't32' again\n- NT4 -> 't84', etc.\n\nWait, no, looking again, I think I might have missed the exact connections.

The string is a sequence of tokens separated by spaces. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the grammar is in CNF, which means each production is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. That should make parsing algorithms like CYK suitable, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll try a different approach.\n\nThe string I'm given is: `t43 t32 t20 t11 t77 t43 t79 t8 t52 t54 t81 t70 t8 t80 t14 t62 t7 t63 t33 t62 t52 t43 t53 t17 t74 t63 t60 t80 t11 t67 t63 t32 t61 t37`.\n\nOkay, each token is a terminal, like 't14', 't32', etc. I need to see if this sequence can be produced by the grammar.\n\nLooking at the grammar, there are a bunch of productions. For example, most non-terminals eventually lead to terminals through various steps. Some non-terminals appear to directly produce a 't' followed by some numbers, like NT2 -> 't7', NT3 -> 't24', etc.\n\nLet me try to see if the string can be generated. Since the first symbol is 't43', I should look at all productions that produce 't43'. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT7 -> 't43' and NT6 -> 't63' and NT5 -> 't33', etc. Wait, no, looking again, NT5 -> 't53' when I see NT5 -> 't53' and also NT0 -> 't43' for 't43'. So, 't43' can be from NT5 -> 't53' or NT0 directly from NT0 -> 't43', or maybe other NTs. Wait, actually, in the grammar, I should check for all productions that have 't43' as a terminal. Looking through the rule list:\n\n- NT7 -> 't43' (Production 1)\n- NT5 -> 't53' (Production)\n- Wait, 't43' as a terminal occurs in NT7 -> 't43' and also NT0 -> 't43' in multiple places.\n\nLooking at the specific productions, I see NT0 has several rules where it goes directly to a 't' followed by some number: NT0 -> 't23', NT0 -> 't28', etc. Wait, perhaps I should list all productions where the LHS is NT0 and the RHS is a terminal string.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT0 -> 't23' ( production 49 )\nNT0 -> 't28' (62)\nNT0 -> 't43' (multiple ones, like 4, 5, etc.)\n\nWait, let me list all NT0 -> a where a is a terminal.\n\nLooking through the given grammar:\n\nNT0 starts producing several 't's:\n- NT0 -> 't23' (production 49)\n- NT0 -> 't28' (62)\n- NT0 -> 't43' (5, 6, 13, 43, etc.)\n- NT0 -> 't52' (62, 70)\n- NT0 -> 't74' (44, 76, 83, etc.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should note that NT0 can produce strings like 't43', 't62' etc.\n\nSo the first token is 't43', which can be produced by NT0 or NT7. Let's consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: The first symbol comes from NT0.\n\nThen, the derivation starts as S -> NT0 NT4 (production from the top rule). So S expands to NT0 NT4. Then, both NT0 and NT4 need to produce their respective symbols.\n\nFrom the string, the first symbol is 't43', so NT0 must produce 't43', which is possible if NT0 -> 't43' (there are multiple such productions). Then, the next symbol is 't32'.\n\nWait, in the string, after 't43', the next is 't32'. So I need to see if the next production from whatever comes after S's expansion can lead to 't32'. Let me try to outline a possible derivation.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThen, the next symbols in the string are 't43', 't32', then 't20', etc.\n\nLet me consider what NT4 produces. Looking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions. For example:\n\nNT4 -> NT3 NT7 (production somewhere, maybe production 7? I need to check the list).\n\nWait, looking through the given grammar:\n\nNT4 has these productions:\n\nNT4 -> NT3 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nNT4 -> NT8 NT6\nNT4 -> NT5 NT3\nNT4 -> NT7 NT0\nNT4 -> NT4 NT3\nNT4 -> NT2 NT7\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\nWait, perhaps I should list all NT4 rules:\n\nLooking through the given rules:\n\n- NT4 -> NT3 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT7 NT0\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT0 NT7\n- ... (Continues until near the end)\n\nWait, the specific rules for NT4 are numerous, but to summarize:\n\nNT4 can split into multiple paths. For instance, one path is NT4 -> NT3 NT7. Let's see where NT3 leads.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions:\n\nNT3 -> NT5 NT6 (production 31)\nNT3 -> NT3 NT0 (production 33)\nNT3 -> NT4 NT3 (production 35)\nNT3 -> NT7 NT2 (36)\nNT3 -> NT5 NT9 (39)\nNT3 -> NT8 NT6 (40)\n...\nWait, let's list the NT3 productions:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT6\n- NT3 -> NT3 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT3 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT9\n- NT3 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT3 -> NT9 NT5\n- NT3 -> NT3 NT0 (maybe more)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting overwhelmed. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nThe first symbol is 't43', so S -> NT0 NT4. Then, from NT0, it needs to produce 't43'. So NT0 could be going to 't43' directly. Let's assume that.\n\nThen, NT4 would need to produce 't32' as the second symbol. Wait, no, the string has 't43 t32 t20 ...', so after S's NT0 produces 't43', the next is 't32' comes from NT4's production.\n\nSo, the second symbol comes from NT4. So, NT4 must produce 't32'. Let's see which rules produce 't32' when NT4 is the LHS.\n\nLooking for NT4 rules that produce a terminal as the first symbol leading to 't32'. However, looking at the given rules, I don't see any NT4 directly producing 't32'. All the NT4 rules have NTs on the RHS, except maybe via chains. Wait, no, I'm probably missing something.\n\nWait, in the grammar's rule list, there's this production:\n\nNT5 -> NT4 NT3 (perhaps production 40?)\n\nWait, looking again at the rules, perhaps some NT4's rules produce a terminal. Let me recheck the full list.\n\nLooking through the entire grammar:\n\nNT4 -> NT5 NT2\n...\nAfter scanning all, I don't see any direct production where NT4 -> 't32' or any terminal. Oh, so perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 't43' comes from NT7 -> 't43'. Let's explore that possibility.\n\nCase 2: The first symbol is from NT7 -> 't43'.\n\nThen, the derivation starts with NT7, and since S -> NT0 NT4, we have NT0 and NT4. Wait, no, the initial production is S -> NT0 NT4, regardless of which NTs are used. So S expands to NT0 NT4. Then, the output starts with 't43', which could be from NT0 or NT7.\n\nIf the first 't43' is from NT0, that's possible. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThen, NT0 produces 't43',"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The grammar given is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), where each non-terminal (like S, NT0, NT2, etc.) splits into two non-terminals on the left side, or terminals on the right side. Since all the right-hand sides of the rules consist of either two non-terminals or a terminal, each expansion rule will eventually lead to terminal symbols.\n\nI'll start by trying to decompose the string step by step, checking if each terminal can be traced back to a production rule. \n\nThe first symbol is `t8`.

For example, NT3 \u2192 t53, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps each rule ends with a terminal or another non-terminal. So, I'm looking for a production where a non-terminal can directly produce `t8`. Looking through all the rules, I see:\n\n- NT4 \u2192 `t8` or `t8 NT7`. Wait, no, the production is `NT4 \u2192 t8 NT7`. So NT4 can produce either `t8 NT7` or another breakdown.

Oh, perhaps `t8` comes from another non-terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for non-terminals that can produce `t8`. Let's see:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 `t5`\n- NT8 \u2192 `t56`\n- NT8 \u2192 `t59`\n\nNo, I don't see `t8` being a product of NT8. Hmm, wait maybe `t8` is part of a chain.\n\nWait, maybe I need to track the productions more carefully. Let me start from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first part is NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut the string starts with `t8`. So the first production must come from NT4 or NT0 splitting into `t8` somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should backtrack from the string. Let's check each token and see if it can be matched by any production.\n\nFirst, `t8`. Let's see if any non-terminal can produce `t8` as a terminal. Looking at all the productions, I see NT7 \u2192 `t54`, NT4 \u2192 `t8`? Wait, no, in the provided rules, NT4 has a production `NT4 \u2192 t8 NT7`, meaning NT4 can output `t8` followed by NT7, but not `t8` alone.

No, wait: in the rules, I see:\n\nLooking at the provided rules:\n\nFor example, `S -> NT0 NT4`\nNT0 has rules like `NT0 -> NT6 NT7` and others, but never `t8`. Wait, perhaps `t8` comes from NT0 or NT4.\n\nWait, maybe `t8` is a result of another non-terminal. Let me think differently. Perhaps I should parse the string using the grammar's productions, starting from S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a top-down parsing approach would help. Since the grammar is in CNF, a recursive descent parser could be used.\n\nEach non-terminal will correspond to a function that generates its expansion. The functions would check if the next part of the input string matches their production.\n\nStarting with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the input starts with `t8`, which must come from either NT0 or NT4.\n\nBut in the first symbol, the input is `t8`, which must be the first terminal of either NT0 or NT4's expansion. Let's see what NT0 and NT4 produce.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT4 NT3\n... and so on.

{"custom_id":"request-670","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to determine whether the provided string is generated by the given context-free grammar. Let me start by understanding the grammar and the string.\n\nFirst, looking at the grammar, it's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production is either A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. The start symbol is S, and I notice that S has two productions: S \u2192 NT0 NT4 and S \u2192 NT9 NT8. So the string must derive from one of these.\n\nThe string provided is a sequence of tokens: `t13 t51 t72 t10 t7 t60 t44 t73 t2 t8 t80 t26 t76 t72 t11 t20 t43 t11 t10 t79 t67 t69 t20 t76 t40 t60 t62 t26 t20 t32 t28 t3 t47 t57 t11`.\n\nMy approach is to map each token to a terminal. It looks like each 't' followed by two digits might correspond to a terminal. So t13, t51, t72, etc., each must be terminals. The grammar should generate a string consisting of these terminals, so I need to see if the grammar can produce this specific sequence.\n\nNext, I notice that the grammar has a lot of non-terminals, but some of them are directly mapped to 't' followed by a number. For example, NT4 \u2192 't37', NT0 \u2192 't23', NT5 \u2192 't47', etc. So each of these non-terminals eventually leads to a specific terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, I think about the possible steps. Starting from S, which is NT0 NT4. The first symbol is 't13'. Let's see what NT0 can derive. NT0 has several productions, but looking at the rules, NT0 can be NT9 NT7 or NT3 NT5. Similarly, NT4 can be NT8 NT6 or other options.\n\nI think the first step is to break down the string into its components and see if each can be produced by a non-terminal. The string starts with t13, so looking for which non-terminals can produce t13.\n\nScanning the grammar, I see NT0 \u2192 't12' is one of the productions, but t13 might be from another non-terminal. Let me check NT0's rules: Oh, wait, NT0 can also be other combinations. Looking further, I see NT0 \u2192 't13' in some rules, like NT0 \u2192 't74' or NT0 \u2192 't35'. But not exactly t13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, looking again, in the grammar, NT0 has multiple productions to 't's, but perhaps not directly to t13. Maybe t13 is produced by another non-terminal. Let me check NT7, for example. NT7 has a rule NT7 \u2192 NT13, but wait, in the grammar, NT7 \u2192 't13'? Let me check the production list. Indeed, under NT7, there's a rule: NT7 \u2192 't54' (from one line) and another NT7 \u2192 't13' (from another line). Wait, actually, looking at the provided grammar, I see:\n\nNT7 -> NT13 \u2192 this is a terminal? Or is 't13' another production. Wait, in the grammar, after NT7, I see:\n\nLooking through, yes, in one rule: NT7 \u2192 't13' is under NT7. But wait, when I look through the provided grammar, it's not directly obvious. Let me find all the terminal productions.\n\nLooking through the rules, each line ends with some NT followed by a terminal or another NT. So, for example, the rule NT7 \u2192 't54'? Wait no, looking back, in the grammar:\n\nThe rules include lines like NT7 -> 't13', meaning that NT7 directly produces 't13'. Similarly, NT3 may produce other terminals.\n\nSo in that case, the first symbol is 't13', which can come from NT7 \u2192 't13'. Now, the string starts with t13, so we have to look back to see how NT7 is part of the initial production.\n\nS can produce NT0 NT4 or NT9 NT8. If the string starts with t13, perhaps the S produces NT7 NT... But wait, the initial S is NT0 NT4, so the first two symbols must come from the expansion of NT0 and NT4. So the first symbol is 't13', which is 't13', but NT0 is followed by NT4. So S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so the string starts with the symbols from NT0 and then NT4.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps S can start with NT7 or NT4? No, S's first production is NT0 NT4, which are two non-terminals. The second production is NT9 NT8. So if the string starts with t13, which is from NT7, but S is NT0 NT4. So how do we reconcile that?\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake. The initial S is split into two non-terminals. So the first token would have to come from one of these. Let me see.\n\nIf the first token is t13, and S is NT0 NT4, then t13 would be the first symbol of either NT0 or NT4. So I need to see what possibilities NT0 can produce t13, or if NT4 can produce t13.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, I see that NT0 has multiple options. For example, one rule is NT0 \u2192 't23', another is NT0 \u2192 't93', another is NT0 \u2192 't52', etc. So looking for a production where NT0 \u2192 't13', do I see that? Scanning NT0's rules:\n\nWait, I see NT0 \u2192 't12' (twelve?), but not thirteen. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the NT0 rules:\n\nLooking through the provided grammar, NT0's rules are:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- (duplicate perhaps?)\n- Also, looking lower down: NT0 \u2192 't74', NT0 \u2192 't35', etc., but not 't13'.\n\nSo maybe I made a mistake earlier. Wait, looking through all the NT0 lines:\n\nYes, in the grammar, under NT0, I don't see any directly to 't13'. So then, perhaps the initial 't13' isn't from a direct production but comes from another non-terminal in the expansion of NT0 or NT4.\n\nWait, no, directly. So if the string starts with t13, and it's produced by S's first part, which is NT0 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the first symbol comes from NT4 since the start is NT0 NT4.\n\nLet me consider: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. The first symbol is t13. So either NT0 generates t13 or NT4 generates t13, or perhaps it's a combination. But since the string starts with (t13 <other symbols>), it's possible that the t13 comes from one of the non-terminals in the expansion of NT0 or NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's possible expansions, does any path eventually lead to producing 't13'?\n\nWait, if NT0 produces 't12' or 't23', but not 't13' directly, perhaps the expansion of NT0 is deeper, but I don't see 't13' being an immediate production. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and the string does not start with a symbol produced directly by the start symbol's production. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the start symbol can also be split into other non-terminals, but according to the grammar, S can only produce NT0 NT4 or NT9 NT8.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbol is from NT4. Let's see. NT4 can produce 't37' (from NT4 \u2192 't37'), or 't13' from NT4 \u2192 't13'? Wait, in the grammar, is there a production where NT4 \u2192 't13'? Looking through the provided lines:\n\nYes! Here's NT4 \u2192 't13' in one rule. So S can produce NT4, which can directly produce 't13'.\n\nAh! So the first symbol t13 comes from NT4. Now, the first part of S is NT0 NT4, so S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first symbol is from NT4, which is 't13', and the next symbol comes from NT0. So the string is t13 followed by whatever NT0 produces.\n\nSo the next symbol after t13 is t51. Let's look at NT0's possible production for t51.\n\nLooking at NT0's rules, I see"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-686","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by this grammar. The string is quite long, so I need a systematic way to approach this without getting overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has each production rule on the left side generating exactly two non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can generate a terminal. Each production has no \u03b5 (epsilon) productions. This structure helps in parsing using algorithms like CYK, but since I'm just trying to determine if the string is in the language, maybe I can think in terms of the grammar's ability to generate the string.\n\nLooking at the grammar, it has a lot of production rules, but many of them involve non-terminals that eventually produce terminal symbols. Each rule on the left has two non-terminals on the right, which suggests that the grammar is context-free but might have high complexity.\n\nThe string given is: `t61 t3 t63 t7 t62 t27 t77 t8 t8 t83 t52 t73 t7 t24 t57 t44 t5 t33 t33 t53 t76 t62 t17 t53 t67 t57 t63 t60 t7 t17 t14 t24 t52 t15 t14 t7`.\n\nI know that in the grammar, the start symbol is S, and it produces NT0 and NT4. So the string must start with a derivation from S, which generates NT0 and NT4, and these non-terminals must expand to produce the string's tokens.\n\nLet me see the start rule: S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first step is that S expands into NT0 and NT4. The string starts with t61, which is a terminal symbol. Looking back at the grammar, t61 is a production of NT6: NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, and NT7 and NT9 further break down into other non-terminals that eventually lead to t61. So t61 is in the language.\n\nBut that's just the first token. The string continues beyond that. Each token in the string must be produced by some non-terminal in the grammar through a series of productions.\n\nLooking at the tokens, I can try to map each one back to their possible origins in the grammar. For example:\n\n- t61: comes from NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9. Then NT7 \u2192 t74 (from NT7 \u2192 't74'), and NT9 \u2192 t60 (from NT9 \u2192 't60'), but wait, no, that's not matching. Wait, actually, I think I misremembered. Let me check the productions again.\n\nWait, looking at the productions, I see specific terminal productions. For example, NT0 \u2192 't23' and NT0 \u2192 't5'. But t61 doesn't appear as a direct terminal in the grammar. Wait, no\u2014looking through the productions, I don't see t61 as a terminal in the left-hand side. Instead, in the right-hand sides, I see some terminals like t14, t24, t37, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the grammar wrong. Let me parse it again.\n\nIn the grammar, each rule is written as, for example, NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. At the bottom of the grammar, there are rules where non-terminals directly produce terminals, like NT0 \u2192 't23', NT0 \u2192 't5', NT5 \u2192 't33', etc.\n\nSo, t61 must be produced by some non-terminal that eventually expands into it. Looking at the grammar, I think NT6 \u2192 't83' or something similar. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because in the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, which then have their own rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t61 comes from a chain of productions leading down to a terminal. Let me check: NT6 has a production to NT7 NT9, which further breaks down. For example, NT7 can produce t74, and NT9 can produce t60, but perhaps those are not directly helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each production of a non-terminal must produce terminals only at the leaves. So, if I can trace a way from each token in the string back to a production that can generate it, then the string is acceptable.\n\nFor example, t61: is there any non-terminal that directly produces t61? Looking at the grammar's rules, at the bottom, I don't see any NT rule that produces 't61' directly. So, t61 must be the result of a non-terminal that expands into it. Looking deeper, perhaps NT6 can produce 't61', but checking the grammar...\n\nWait, actually, in the rules I see NT6 \u2192 't61' as a production. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the rules, yes, under NT6: NT6 \u2192 't77', NT6 \u2192 't43', NT6 \u2192 't83', NT6 \u2192 't61'. So, NT6 can directly produce 't61'. That's good. So the first token 't61' is produced by NT6.\n\nNow, the next token is 't3'. Let's see what can produce 't3'. Looking at the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't72', 't53', 't33', 't3', and others.\n\nWait, checking the rules for NT3, yes, NT3 can directly produce 't3', 't72', etc. So 't3' is possible from NT3.\n\nContinuing, the next tokens after 't3' are 't63', 't7', 't62', etc. So each of these must be generated by some non-terminal that can produce them.\n\nBut this approach would be time-consuming because the string is long. Maybe instead of going token by token, I should try to see if the entire string can be derived from S by constructing the parse trees in a way that each token is connected through the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or the string is a concatenation of certain sequences that the grammar can produce.\n\nAnother approach is to think in terms of the grammar's structure and see if the string can be built by a series of left or right derivations.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to notice that the grammar is quite complex, but maybe the string is built from the non-terminals that eventually produce the given terminals.\n\nWait, I notice that the string starts with 't61', which is a direct production of NT6. So the first non-terminal in the string is likely to be NT6. But since S expands into NT0 NT4, perhaps NT0 or NT4 is involved.\n\nWait, no, because S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the entire derivation will have to produce the string via both NT0 and NT4. But the string starts with t61, which is produced by NT6, which must be reachable from either NT0 or NT4.\n\nHmm, but NT0 and NT4 are the start symbols after S, so the first step is NT0 and NT4. How do they get transformed?\n\nNT0 can produce NT6 NT7, for example. So NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, which could produce 't61' if NT6 is 't61', but that's one token. Wait, no\u2014each production adds more non-terminals until we reach the terminals.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the string is built by a series of productions that ultimately lead to each terminal. However, without a detailed parse tree, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check each token in the string to see if it is present as a terminal in the grammar. From the rules, there are terminals like t7, t14, t23, t24, etc., but I don't see t61 as a terminal\u2014wait, actually, looking through the rules, I see NT6 \u2192 't61', which is a terminal. So t61 is allowed, as well as other tokens like t3, t63, etc., which are connected through other rules.\n\nBut each token must be generated by some non-terminal in the grammar. So for each token in the string, I can check if it's a terminal that appears in the rules as a right-hand side.\n\nLooking again at the rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23', 't5', 't7', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't10', 't23', etc.\n- NT3 has 't72', 't53', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't61', 't77', etc.\n\nSo each token in the string appears as a terminal in the grammar's rules, so at least each token is capable of being generated by some non-terminal. Therefore, each token is potentially valid, but the issue is whether the entire string can be generated through a series of valid productions starting from S.\n\nBut this doesn't automatically guarantee that the entire string is generated. It just means each token is possible.\n\nTherefore, I need a more thorough approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is built using specific sequences that the grammar enforces.

{"custom_id":"request-693","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've been given a task to determine whether a specific string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) provided in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The string I need to evaluate is: `t15 t27 t57 t24 t11 t3 t43 t70 t43 t44 t83 t52 t76 t60 t61 t3 t3 t27 t14 t13 t51 t57 t51 t11 t74 t8 t13 t10 t63 t44 t57 t57 t7 t42 t80 t8`.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the CFG. The grammar starts with the start symbol S, which is rewritten as NT0 NT4 (S -> NT0 NT4). So, to produce the string, I must start with NT0 and NT4, each of which further break down into combinations of other non-terminals (NTs) until they produce terminal symbols (denoted by 't' followed by a number).\n\nLooking at the rules, I notice that NT0 can produce several combinations, with some rules leading to terminal symbols. For example, NT0 -> 't23' is one of the productions. Similarly, NT3, NT5, etc., have terminal productions. Each NT eventually leads down to a terminal symbol through a chain of productions.\n\nThe string given is a sequence of terminal symbols. To check if it's generated by the grammar, I need to see if each step in the string can be derived from the grammar, working from the start symbol down to the terminals.\n\nGiven that the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals, and a is a terminal. This structure makes it easier for some parsing methods (like the CYK algorithm) to work, but manually, I need to check possible derivations.\n\nThe string has 39 tokens. Let's see if I can parse this step by step.\n\n1. The string starts with t15, which is derived from NT4 in the rule NT4 -> 't43'. Wait, no. Wait, looking back, I see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 has a production like NT4 -> 't5' and others. Wait, actually, the string has t15 as the first symbol. Hmm, but in the grammar, which rule produces 't15'? Let me look:\n\nLooking through the rules, I see:\n\nNT4 has a production NT4 -> 't37', but I don't see a direct rule for 't15'. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Or wait, maybe I'm not reading correctly.\n\nWait, in the grammar, the rules under NT4 include:\n\nNT4 -> 't32'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't37'\nNT4 -> 't5'\nNT4 -> 't28'\nNT4 -> 't7'\nNT4 -> 't27'\nNT4 -> 't80'\nNT4 -> 't8'\nNT4 -> 't32'\n\nSo, none of the NT4's seem to produce 't15' directly. Hmm, that's a problem because the first token is 't15'. If there's no rule that produces 't15', that might mean this string isn't generated by the grammar. But let me confirm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look deeper. The NT4 could be part of a larger production chain. For example, NT4 could be derived from NT0 and NT4, but wait, the start symbol S is NT0 NT4. So, the start symbol expands into NT0 and NT4, which each expand further.\n\nWait, maybe the first symbols in the string can be matched by some combination. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t15 t27 t57 t24 etc. Let me see how 't15' can be generated. Looking through all the terminal rules, I don't see any NT that produces 't15' directly. So either the grammar doesn't have a production for 't15', meaning the string isn't generated, or perhaps I'm missing a rule.\n\nWait, perhaps an NT can be derived into 't15' through a combination of other rules. Let me check each NT to see if any of their productions lead down to 't15'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, the NTs are many, and it's possible that certain combinations generate 't15'. Alternatively, perhaps the string includes tokens that can't be produced at all, meaning it's invalid.\n\nWait, let's focus on the first few tokens: t15, t27, t57.\n\nt15 is from NT4? No, NT4 directly produces, say, 't8' or 't5', not 't15'. Does any NT produce 't15'? Let me scan all the NT rules:\n\nLooking through each NT, do any of them directly produce 't15'? It doesn't seem so. The only NT with terminal symbols I can see are:\n\nNT3 -> 't72', 't39', etc.\n\nNT4: 't5', 't8', etc.\n\nNT5: 't47', 't33', etc.\n\nNT7: 't13', 't54', etc.\n\nNT8: 't5', 't21', etc.\n\nNT9: 't11', 't60', 't63', etc.\n\nNT2: 't7', 't26', etc.\n\nNT0: 't23', 't43', 't52', etc.\n\nSo, none of these directly produce 't15'. So, perhaps the string starts with a token that can't be generated, which would immediately make it invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first token is somehow derived from a combination of NTs.\n\nWait, but if the start symbol S is NT0 NT4, then the first symbols in the generated string will be t23, t43, or more likely from the derivations of NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the possible expansions:\n\nLet me try to see if the first part of the string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nStarting with NT0 and NT4:\n\nNT0 can expand into various things. For example, NT0 -> 't23' is a possibility.\n\nNT4 can expand into various things. From earlier, NT4 -> 't37' or 't28' or 't74', etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the first symbol t15 comes from a deeper expansion of an NT that can produce t15.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and since none of the NT rules produce 't15', then 't15' cannot be in any generated string, so the answer is 'No'.\n\nBut let me double-check to see if any NT can derive to 't15'. Looking again, all the NT rules produce combinations of other NTs or terminals, but no NT directly produces 't15'. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a token \"t15\" which cannot be directly or indirectly derived from the given context-free grammar, as no non-terminal symbol in the grammar produces \"t15\".\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-708","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar presented in Chomsky normal form. The string is a sequence of symbols like `t70 t43 t44 ...` and so on. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a context-free grammar is. It's a set of production rules that generate all possible strings in a language. Each production rule is of the form A \u2192 \u03b1, where A is a non-terminal symbol and \u03b1 is a string of terminal and non-terminal symbols. Chomsky normal form restricts each production to have at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side, which is the case here.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see it's quite extensive with many production rules. Each non-terminal eventually seems to produce a single terminal symbol. For example, NT7 \u2192 t13, NT9 \u2192 t43, etc. So, this grammar is likely designed to generate a specific, unique string made up of these terminals.\n\nThe string I need to check is `t70 t43 t44 t14 t60 t7 t79 t77 t3 t7 t14 t13 t31 t26 t26 t21 t32 t5 t43 t17 t10 t10 t53 t11 t40 t67 t77 t57 t28 t76 t14 t17 t67 t33 t54 t43 t70`. \n\nSince the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation replaces a non-terminal with another non-terminal or terminal. The starting symbol is S, which first produces NT0 NT4. Each of these can then produce other non-terminals, and the process continues until all non-terminals are replaced by terminals.\n\nGiven the complexity, I wonder if there's a pattern or a specific derivation path that leads to this string. However, manually following each production step might take too long, given the length and complexity of the string. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAn alternative method is to see if the string can be broken down according to the grammar's rules. Since each symbol in the string is a terminal, each must be derived from some production rule of the non-terminals. For instance, t70 comes from NT4 \u2192 t70, so NT4 must appear at that part of the derivation.\n\nLooking at the string:\n\nt70 comes first. Since S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the first step is to produce NT0 and NT4. So t70 must come from NT4. Let me check NT4's production rules. NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT4, NT4 \u2192 NT0 NT6, among others, and finally NT4 \u2192 t37. So t70 is not directly produced by NT4, so maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe each symbol in the string corresponds to a production step. So starting from S, which is NT0 NT4, we need to see how these can break down into the given sequence.\n\nPerhaps it's better to approach this by seeing if the string can be split into parts that match the derivation steps. However, without knowing the exact order of productions, this might be tricky.\n\nAnother idea is to construct the parse tree for the string step by step using the grammar. Starting from the root S, which is NT0 NT4, but our string starts with t70, which suggests that one of these two non-terminals must derive to t70. Let me check the production rules for NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0: It has several productions leading eventually to t23. So t70 comes from NT4. Wait, no, because NT4's production can lead to t37, but in the string, t70 comes first. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is built.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string is constructed by the combination of the terminal symbols derived from S's expansion. Let me check if all the terminals in the string are present in the grammar. The string has t70, t43, t44, etc. I don't see all these in the grammar's production rules. For example, t44 is a terminal? Let me check the grammar provided.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I see produce rules where NT7 \u2192 t13, NT3 \u2192 t72, etc. Do I see t44 as a terminal? scrolling through the productions, yes, I see NT4 \u2192 t37, which is 't37', not t44. Wait, does the string include t44 or t37?\n\nWait, the string given starts with t70 t43 t44... Wait, is t44 a terminal, or did I miss it? Let me go back to the grammar. Looking through the rules, I see NT7 \u2192 t13, NT3 \u2192 t72, NT5 \u2192 t47, NT8 \u2192 t5, etc. Let me list all the terminal symbols:\n\n- t70, t43, t44, t14, t60, t7, t79, t77, t3, t7, t14, t13, t31, t26, t26, t21, t32, t5, t43, t17, t10, t10, t53, t11, t40, t67, t77, t57, t28, t76, t14, t17, t67, t33, t54, t43, t70.\n\nLooking through the grammar's terminal rules, I only see t23, t28, t43, t54, etc. However, t44 is not listed as a terminal in the grammar, which means the string cannot be generated by this grammar. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through the grammar rules again. Under NT7: NT7 \u2192 t13. NT3 \u2192 t72. NT5 \u2192 t47. NT0 \u2192 t23. NT8 \u2192 t5. NT9 \u2192 t60? Wait, looking at the rules:\n\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- and so on.\n\nSo, t44 is not listed as a terminal in any production rule. That means if the string contains 't44', it's not possible because that terminal doesn't exist in the grammar. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nWait, but I might have missed it. Let me check all the productions again. From the grammar, every time a terminal is present, it's like \"NTx \u2192 tyy\". For example:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 t13\n- NT3 \u2192 t72\n- NT5 \u2192 t47\n- NT4 \u2192 t37\n- NT0 \u2192 t23\n- NT8 \u2192 t5\n- NT9 \u2192 t60\n- NT3 \u2192 t72 again?\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- For NT3: it's written as NT3 -> t72, and again later NT3 -> t31, and others. Wait, no, actually, in the grammar given, some NT3 have 't72' as a terminal, others have different rules. Wait, let's make sure.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor NT3, I see several production rules:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 t53\n- NT3 \u2192 t31\n- NT3 \u2192 t43\n- NT3 \u2192 t69\n- NT3 \u2192 t24\n\nWait, but none of those are t44. So t44 is not a terminal. Therefore, the string includes t44, which is not present in any production as a terminal, so the string cannot be generated by this grammar.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the given grammar.\n<\/think>\n\nThe string contains a terminal symbol ('t44') that is not produced by any of the grammar's production rules.

The grammar is in Chomsky normal form, which I know means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol, which can produce a single non-terminal or terminal. The string I need to check is a sequence of 't' followed by a number. \n\nFirst, I should look at the grammar and the string. The grammar consists of a bunch of production rules starting from S. The string to check is: t44 t43 t47 t54 t7 t69 t77 t54 t51 t28 t14 t57 t23 t74 t70 t43 t7 t69 t62 t12 t53 t20 t37 t8 t12 t54 t14 t79 t24 t76 t53 t9 t35 t53 t5 t8 t40. \n\nHmm, I notice that each production rule in the grammar seems to consist of two non-terminals. The string is a sequence of terminals, which are presumably the leaves of the parse tree. So, each terminal in the string must be derived from the grammar rules. \n\nI think the approach here is to trace back the productions to see if the string can be constructed step by step. Let me list out the string components again:\n\nt44, t43, t47, t54, t7, t69, t77, t54, t51, t28, t14, t57, t23, t74, t70, t43, t7, t69, t62, t12, t53, t20, t37, t8, t12, t54, t14, t79, t24, t76, t53, t9, t35, t53, t5, t8, t40.\n\nI should probably start from the beginning and see how each 't' could have been generated. For example, the first token is t44. Let's look at the grammar to see where 't44' is defined. Looking through the rules, I see NT4 -> t37, t32, t8, t5, t3. Wait, no, I'm looking for 't44'.

{"custom_id":"request-723","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I've got to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's see what I can do.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar. It's in Chomsky normal form, which is good because that means each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S -> NT0 NT4. So the derivation starts with NT0 and NT4.\n\nNow, looking at the string: `t13 t20 t62 t7 t67 t8 t61 t28 t54 t57 t63 t74 t63 t23 t33 t76 t14 t15 t8 t13 t11 t14 t31 t79 t60 t77 t43 t8 t43 t53 t57 t44 t63 t7 t79 t35 t7 t37`.\n\nThis is a series of t-terms, which I assume are terminals. Each of these is likely a string element in the derived string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step of the derivation produces two symbols. The string has 35 tokens, which is even? Let me check: 35 is odd, so perhaps that's a problem because each production adds two symbols except the last one? Or maybe the count isn't directly related.\n\nWait, no. Each production rule either introduces two symbols or two non-terminals. Since the grammar is in CNF, each production is either A->BC or A->a. So, when you have starting from S, each step must eventually lead to a sequence of terminals. The total number of terminals in the string is 35, which is odd. Since each production rule after the first step (starting from S) doubles the number of symbols, the number of terminals generated must be 2^k for some k. Since 35 is not a power of 2, it's unlikely that the string is generated by this grammar. But wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying because the grammar could have many non-terminals and the derivation could interleave the non-terminals in a way that the count isn't exactly 2^k. Hmm, but the key is that in a full derivation starting from S, which splits into two parts (NT0 and NT4), each of which may further split, the total number of leaves (terminals) should be a power of two because each step doubles the count. So 35 is not a power of two (powers are 1,2,4,8,16,32, etc.), and 35 isn't any of those. So that might already indicate that the string can't be generated by this grammar.\n\nBut wait, maybe the initial symbols don't both split, so some might produce fewer. Wait no, because each production leads to two symbols. So starting from S, each step after the first one would generate a string with 2^n symbols. The initial S would first split into NT0 NT4, and each of those would split, etc. So the total number of terminals would be 2^k, where k is the number of splits. So with 35 terms, since it's not a power of two, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, looking at the first few steps, the string starts with t13. In the grammar, t13 is generated by NT7 -> t13 (from one of the rules: NT7 -> t13 is likely). So perhaps NT7 is part of the decomposition. Let me check the grammar rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see many rules, but I need to see if t13 is a terminal. I see NT7 -> 't13' somewhere, so yes, NT7 can produce 't13'. So the first token t13 could come from NT7.\n\nNext is t20. Looking for where t20 is generated. From the rules, I don't immediately see a rule that produces t20. So maybe t20 is generated by another NT, but looking through the grammar, I don't see any rule that ends with t20 as a terminal. So unless t20 is part of a non-terminal that somehow produces it as a terminal, which I don't see, the second token t20 might not be possible, unless there's a rule I missed.\n\nWait, looking through the rules, I see all the terminals are assigned to non-terminals, like NT3 -> 't72' or NT2 -> 't7', etc. So each terminal is a single 't' followed by some digits. So t13 is derived from NT7, and t20 would need to be generated from another non-terminal. But I don't see any rule that has 't20' as a terminal. So without a rule for t20, it's impossible for the string to include 't20'. So that means the string can't be generated by the grammar.\n\nWait, but maybe t20 is a mistake, and it should be something else. Let me check again. Looking through the production rules for NT2: NT2 -> 't7', so that's directly. NT3: some rules, but not 't20'. NT5: several rules, none ending with t20. NT4: some rules, none with t20. NT6: same. NT7: 't13'. So, indeed, there is no production that generates 't20' as a terminal.

Looking at the given grammar, it seems to consist of multiple production rules that combine non-terminals, but I'll have to check each production to confirm if it's in CNF.\n\nWait, the given grammar has productions like `S -> NT0 NT4`, which is in CNF since each part is a non-terminal. For terminal symbols, like `t3`, the grammar must have production rules ending with them. For example, `NT3 -> 't72'` is a terminal production.\n\nSo the string given consists of a sequence of terminal symbols (like 't3', 't61', etc.), and I need to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by expanding non-terminals step by step.\n\nBut processing a string of 40 tokens manually might be cumbersome. Perhaps I can look for known words or patterns in the string that correspond to known productions.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to parse the string step by step by seeing if each token can be matched as a result of expanding the grammar, but that might take a long time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that each production in the grammar either produces two non-terminals or a terminal. Since this is in CNF, each step in the derivation replaces a non-terminal with two others, one of which could be a terminal. So each production that results in a terminal must have that terminal appear in the string when fully expanded.\n\nLooking at the string, all the tokens are terminals. Wait, no, the grammar actually has some non-terminals that produce terminals. For example, `NT3 -> 't72'` means that `t72` is a terminal generated by NT3.\n\nBut the string given is a sequence of these terminals. So I need to check if the sequence can be generated by the grammar, perhaps through leftmost derivations or similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's more efficient to look at the grammar to see what possible sequences can be generated, but that's still a lot.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the grammar's non-terminals can be assigned a certain order in which they appear, and the string might follow a pattern that can be derived from starting symbol S.\n\nBut honestly, manually checking each step seems impractical. Maybe I can start by looking for known sequences in the string that correspond to shorter derivations.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by noting that the grammar is context-free, so the string's structure should follow a context-free derivation pathway.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to identify if the string is a possible leftmost or rightmost expansion of S.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that all the given terminals are generated as leaves in the parse tree, and each production contributes to a node in the tree that combines symbols.\n\nWait, perhaps I can track the possible non-terminals that can produce each terminal. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the string, let's take the first few tokens: `t3`, `t61`, `t5`, `t10`, `t44`, etc.\n\nLet me check if 't3' exists as a terminal. Yes, in the grammar: `NT3 -> 't72'`. So any occurrence of 't72' is produced by NT3.\n\nWait, but in the string, it's t3, so perhaps that's another NT. Let me check the grammar. Wait, the grammar's non-terminals that produce t's: \n\n- NT3 \u2192 't33' (perhaps, wait: looking at the given grammar, lines like `NT3 -> 't31'`, `NT3 -> 't72'`, etc.\n\nWait, let me parse the grammar to see which NT produces which 't' token.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\n- `NT3 -> 't72'`\n- `NT3 -> 't31'`\n- `NT3 -> 't39'`\n- `NT3 -> 't53'`\n- `NT3 -> 't47'`\n- `NT3 -> 't51'`\n- `NT3 -> 't76'` (Wait, no, looking at the given grammar: I need to list all the NT3 productions.)\n\nWait, the user provided the grammar as a series of lines, each line being a production. Let me go through them to find all NT3 rules.\n\nLooking through the grammar provided:\n\n- `NT3 -> 't72'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't31'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't39'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't53'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't47'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't51'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't76'` (Line)\n- `NT3 -> 't34'` (Looking for 't34', wait\u2014looking back.)\n\nWait, actually, it's given as `NT3 -> 't34'` in the provided grammar? Let me check:\n\nLooking through the given grammar lines, the relevant ones are:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72'\n- NT3 -> 't31'\n- NT3 -> 't39'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT3 -> 't47'\n- NT3 -> 't51'\n- NT3 -> 't76'\n- NT3 -> 't34'\n- NT3 -> 't31' (Wait, I might have miscounted.)\n\nWait, actually, the grammar includes several NT3 productions. For example, the grammar has:\n\nNT3 -> 't72' (line)\nNT3 -> 't31' (line)\nNT3 -> 't39' (line)\nNT3 -> 't53' (line)\nNT3 -> 't47' (line)\nNT3 -> 't51' (line)\nNT3 -> 't76' (line)\nNT3 -> 't34' (line)\nNT3 -> 't31' (line)\n... and others?\n\nWait, perhaps each production ends with a specific 't' symbol. So 't31' is from NT3. Similarly, NT5 produces 't43', NT4 produces 't5', etc.\n\nSo each terminal in the string must be the result of a non-terminal production.\n\nNow, the given string is:\n\nt3 t61 t5 t10 t44 t33 t7 t10 t8 t51 t52 t76 t51 t51 t37 t83 t39 t47 t7 t43 t9 t51 t35 t31 t7 t28 t22 t62 t31 t44 t76 t43 t40 t11 t27 t63 t14 t42\n\nWait, but I just noticed that some of these are two-digit numbers like 't61', 't52', etc. Those correspond to specific NT productions. For example, 't61' must come from NT61? Wait, wait, no. Wait, looking at the grammar, I see lines like NT6 -> 't61', for example.\n\nSo let me check each terminal to see if it's generated from a non-terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar, for example:\n\n- NT6 -> 't61' (line: \"NT6 -> 't61'\")\n- NT3 -> 't33' (line: \"NT3 -> 't33'\")\n- NT5 -> 't43' (line: \"NT5 -> 't43'\")\n- NT7 -> 't54' (line)\n- NT9 -> 't60' (line)\n- NT4 -> 't5' (line)\n- NT2 -> 't7' (line)\n- NT11 -> 't14' (line)\n- Etc.\n\nSo each of these 't' terms in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal. Now, the first token is 't3', but according to the grammar, 't3' might not be a terminal. Or is it?\n\nWait, looking at the grammar, some of the lines have `NT3 -> 't3'` but I don't think that's present. Wait, in the given grammar, do I see NT3 -> 't3'? Let me check.\n\nLooking through the lines:\n\n- There's `NT3 -> 't72'`\n- `NT3 -> 't31'`\n- `NT3 ->"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-736","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form and a string to check if it's generated by the grammar. The string is `t15 t17 t11 t83 t10 t7 t43 t84 t35 t10 t57 t79 t7 t13 t43 t14 t72 t63 t60 t61 t8 t54 t20 t47 t62 t84 t69 t26 t7 t20 t54 t62 t79 t17 t13 t31 t53 t84 t8`. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the grammar. It's written in a way where every production is a non-terminal on the left side transforming into two non-terminals on the right. Some of these right-side symbols are terminals, as indicated by the strings like 't15', 't17', etc. \n\nLooking at the start symbol, I see S -> NT0 NT4. So, the string must start with the symbols produced by NT0 and NT4. \n\nI notice that NT0 and NT4 can produce various combinations, but each step reduces the non-terminals to terminals through these productions. My task is to see if the given string can be derived from the start symbol by applying these productions step by step.\n\nI start by parsing the string from the beginning and see if each part matches a production. For instance, the beginning is 't15 t17'. I check if there's a production that can derive this. Looking through the grammar, I see NT15 and NT17... wait, but in the grammar, I don't see NT15 or NT17 directly. Instead, I find that NT15 is on the right side of a production for another NT. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at the wrong approach.\n\nWait, no, I think I misread. The right-hand sides of the grammar seem to have specific sequences that lead to the terminals. Let me look for the start point.\n\nThe string starts with 't15 t17'. I check if there's a production that starts with NT that can derive 't15 t17'. Scanning through, I find NT15 -> NT32, etc. Wait, perhaps I should approach this by building the parse tree.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out a sequence of productions that would generate the string. Since the grammar is in CNF, each step must produce exactly two symbols, one of which could be a terminal.\n\nAnother approach is to create a parse table or use recursion to see if the string can be broken down recursively according to the grammar rules.\n\nStarting with the entire string, split it into pairs and check if each pair can be derived from a production rule. Let's try splitting the string into pairs of tokens, starting from the beginning:\n\nFirst pair: t15 t17\nLooking for a production that produces t15 and t17. Looking through the grammar, I find:\n- NT15 -> NT32\n- Wait, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the reverse: is there a NT that can produce t15 t17? I see NT32 produces t15 and others. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for a non-terminal that produces t15, and another that produces t17, but connected via a production. Wait, but in the grammar, each production is of the form NT -> NT NT, so each step produces two non-terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a leftmost derivation. Let's see:\n\nThe string starts with t15 t17. Suppose the first production is NS -> NT0 NT4. Let's see:\n\nFrom S, we get NT0 NT4. Then, we need to parse the string starting with t15 and t17. So, the first NT0 produces some part, and NT4 produces another. Let's see where t15 and t17 come from.\n\nLooking at the NTs:\n\n- NT0 is derived from NT6 and NT7. Then NT6 is derived from NT0 and NT2, or other combinations. This is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that the grammar might be designed in a way that each symbol in the string corresponds to a specific non-terminal path. Maybe the string is constructed by following a specific derivation path.\n\nLooking for the last part of the string: it ends with 't79 t17 t13 t31 t53 t84 t8'. I see 't8' at the end, which is produced by NT8. Let's look at NT8 productions:\n\nFrom the grammar, NT8 can be derived into various combinations, including 't8' directly in some cases. For example, one production is NT8 -> NT4 NT7, which could eventually lead to a terminal. But in the string, the last token is 't8', which is a terminal. So, perhaps the last production involves a terminal.\n\nWait, actually, looking at the grammar, some NTs directly have terminal symbols as their productions. For example:\n\n- NT3 -> 't72' etc. So, if in the derivation, a symbol like NT3 is used, it can be replaced by the terminal 't72'.\n\nBut in the given string, the last part is 't8', so I need to see if any NT can derive 't8'. Looking through the productions, perhaps NT15 or NT17 can produce 't8' at some point. Alternatively, maybe it's NT2 -> t7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a production chain leading to 't8' must be considered.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the string is a concatenation of specific non-terminals that eventually produce these terminals.\n\nBut given the complexity, perhaps the string corresponds to a sequence where each pair of non-terminals in the derivation matches the sequence in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the string is a sequence of productions, where each two tokens represent a production step. But the starting point is S, which splits into two non-terminals. So, the string should consist of a series of productions applied in leftmost order, leading from S to the terminal string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is a parse tree where each node's children correspond to the productions.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for an alternative method. Maybe using the CYK algorithm to check if the string is in the language. But given the time, perhaps I can spot some inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the first two tokens: t15 t17. Do any productions generate these as a unit? Looking through the grammar, NT15 is derived from NT32, which comes from NT8. Not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps t15 and t17 come from different parts of the grammar. For example, t15 could come from NT5 -> NT9 NT6, and t17 from NT3 -> NT4 NT3. But I'm not sure if that connects correctly.\n\nWait, maybe the first token t15 is the result of a NT that eventually produces it, and the second t17 is another NT production. But how do they connect in the derivation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is too long or contains symbols that cannot be derived from the grammar. For example, looking at 't17', 't13', 't31', etc., I wonder if these correspond to any NT productions.\n\nLet me think about how t13 could be produced. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT3 -> 't72'; NT2 -> 't7'; NT0 -> 't23'; NT4 -> 't3'; etc. Hmm, not t13. Wait, perhaps t13 comes from a production that eventually reduces to t13.\n\nWait, looking at NT7 productions: NT7 -> NT13 NT4. Could NT13 be a terminal? Checking, yes, NT13 is a terminal in the grammar (it's a string like 't13'). So, NT7 -> t13 NT4. Then, NT4 can produce t3 or other NTs. So, t13 could come from NT7.\n\nBut in the string, I have t17, which is another symbol. So, perhaps t17 comes from another NT.\n\nAnother approach: Let me count the number of tokens. The string has 39 tokens. Since each production step adds two tokens, the derivation starts with 2 (from S), then the string should have 2^k tokens, but 39 is not a power of 2, which suggests that the string might not be derived from the grammar, but that doesn't necessarily confirm it.\n\nWait, no. In Chomsky Normal Form, each production step replaces a non-terminal with two non-terminals or terminals. So, the number of symbols at each step increases by the number of productions that introduce terminals. However, the exact count depends on the specific derivation. It's possible for the string length to vary.\n\nBut 39 is an odd number, while every production either doubles the count (if both are non-terminals) or reduces if a terminal is introduced.

{"custom_id":"request-734","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). The grammar is provided, and the string to evaluate is quite long. Hmm, let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Chomsky Normal Form entails. CNF has production rules where each non-terminal on the left side produces exactly two non-terminals on the right. Additionally, the start symbol can also produce a terminal. Oh, and there are no epsilon productions, so every production must generate something that will eventually produce terminals through other productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar given, all the productions seem to be in CNF. For example, S -> NT0 NT4 is a non-terminal S producing two non-terminals NT0 and NT4. But wait, S is the start symbol, so the start symbol can only produce terminals eventually, not non-terminals. Let me check that. The start symbol S indeed goes to NT0 and NT4. So those two must eventually generate terminals, otherwise, we're stuck with non-terminals in the start symbol, which is invalid. Hmm, maybe this grammar allows multiple steps, but I need to ensure that the string can be derived correctly.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t8 t40 t44 t43 t56 t20 t63 t3 t39 t62 t14 t8 t76 t35 t23 t70 t67 t26 t7 t7 t9 t70 t61 t7 t24 t39 t8 t62 t26 t31 t54 t14 t73 t63 t51 t76 t43 t27 t27`\n\nWait, I think the hyphens might just separate the tokens, so the actual string is: \"t8 t40 t44 t43 t56 t20 t63 t3 t39 t62 t14 t8 t76 t35 t23 t70 t67 t26 t7 t7 t9 t70 t61 t7 t24 t39 t8 t62 t26 t31 t54 t14 t73 t63 t51 t76 t43 t27 t27\"\n\nSo each \"t\" followed by numbers represents a terminal symbol. The grammar's non-terminals are labeled NT followed by numbers like NT0, NT1, etc. The terminals are those 't' strings, but in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce terminals. For example, NT2 -> 't7' and others.\n\nSince the string consists of terminal symbols, we need to see if each of these terms can be derived from the grammar.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to parse the string step by step, trying to find a derivation. However, the string is quite long, so manually trying to parse each symbol might take a lot of time and could be error-prone.\n\nLet me see if I can look for patterns or break the string down into smaller parts that I can test against the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to note that each terminal in the string must be the result of productions expanding down from some non-terminal in the grammar. For instance, each 'tX' in the string must correspond to a terminal production from a non-terminal, which in turn must have a production chain that leads down to it.\n\nLooking at the string, the first symbol is 't8'. I need to check if 't8' is a production of any non-terminal. Looking through the grammar rules, I see NT4 -> 't8', NT0 -> 't23', etc. So 't8' is produced by NT4.\n\nSo for the first token 't8', it must come from NT4. Let's see what NT4 produces. Looking at the grammar: NT4 -> NT5 NT2 and NT4 -> NT8 NT6. So NT4 can produce either of those. Wait, but that doesn't directly produce 't8'; 't8' is a terminal, right?\n\nNo, wait. Actually, in the grammar, some non-terminals directly produce a terminal. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the grammar rules, I notice that some non-terminals produce terminals. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- And so on.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that NT4 -> 't8' is not a production. Instead, in the top-level productions, NT4 is only producing concatenations of other non-terminals. So in the grammar given, NT4's productions are combinations of other non-terminals, none of which directly produce 't8'. So how does 't8' come about?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe 't8' is a production of a deeper-level non-terminal. Let's check the rules again. For example, looking for 't8' in the productions:\n\nHmm, looking through the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- And in other rules, NT8 -> NT6 NT0, NT5 -> 't3', etc.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check that again. Perhaps I missed where 't8' is a production of a non-terminal. Let me go through the list:\n\nLooking at each rule:\n\n- NT7 -> NT13\n- NT6 -> something\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT9 -> 't44'\n- Wait, no. Let me check each of the rules where a non-terminal ends up producing a terminal.\n\nActually, looking through, I can see that some non-terminals produce terminals directly. For example:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT5 -> 't47' (is that a terminal? Probably, but I'm not sure if that's 't4' or 't47'. Wait, the string is like 't43', 't40', 't27', etc., so perhaps the grammar uses 't' followed by numbers as terminals, like 'tX' where X is some number.\n\nWait, perhaps the terminals in the grammar are of the form 't' followed by a number. Looking back:\n\nYes, in the grammar, some rules produce a terminal, e.g., NT2 -> 't7', which presumably represents the terminal symbol 't7'. Similarly, NT5 -> 't47' would be a terminal symbol 't47'.\n\nSo, the key is to see, for each token in the string, whether there's a non-terminal in the grammar that directly produces that terminal via a production. If so, we can trace backward to see how that non-terminal can be derived from other non-terminals leading down to the start symbol.\n\nBut wait, some strings in the string may require multiple steps. For example, maybe the 't8' comes from a non-terminal NT4, which in turn comes from NT5 and NT2, and so on, until you get down to the start symbol S.\n\nBut the problem is that each production in CNF must have the left-hand side non-terminal produce exactly two non-terminals. So, each time you apply a rule, you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals. Thus, the derivation would expand the start symbol S into a sequence of non-terminals, which in turn expand until all non-terminals are replaced by their terminals.\n\nGiven that the string is made up of terminal symbols, each of which must be derived from the bottom up. So, the first step is to find where each 'tX' in the string is produced by some NT rule. Then, each of those NTs must themselves be derived from other NTs, and so on until we reach the start symbol.\n\nBut let's take the first token in the string: 't8'. We need to find if any production in the grammar directly has 't8' as its sole production. Looking through the rules, I don't see any NTx -> 't8' production. So that suggests that 't8' is part of a larger derivation. Hmm, but perhaps it is. For example, NT4 could produce NT5 and NT2, and NT5 and NT2 could produce other non-terminals which, in turn, produce 't8'.\n\nWait, but in the given grammar, NT4 only produces concatenations of other non-terminals, not terminals. So 't8' can't appear directly as the result of a single production from NT4. That must mean that 't8' is the result of a completely derived subtree starting from some non-terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, but the grammar might have non-terminals that produce other non-terminals, and so on, until a terminal is reached. But how does that work? Each production in CNF leads a non-terminal to two non-terminals. So every step of the way, you replace a non-terminal with two non-terminals, which may in turn lead to terminals.\n\nSo, to get a single 't8' in the string, there must be a path from some non-terminal (perhaps near the top) through a series of productions that ultimately derive 't8'.\n\nBut this seems complicated.

It's in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means every production is of the form A \u2192 BC, where A, B, C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol which can produce terminals. However, looking at the grammar, some right-hand sides have terminals and non-terminals mixed. Wait, no, actually, in CNF, the productions can't have terminals on the right-hand side except for the start symbol in the case of a terminal string. Hmm, but looking at the grammar, some productions have both non-terminals and terminals. That might mean it's not strictly in CNF, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, no, in CNF, each production must have exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. So if any production has a terminal, that might not be CNF. Let me check: the productions like NT0 -> 't23' have terminals. So that would violate CNF because CNF requires all productions (except the start symbol in the case where the start symbol can produce a terminal) to be of the form A \u2192 BC.\n\nWait, no, actually, some sources say that CNF allows productions to have single terminals, which makes it a two-layered grammar, but strictly, CNF requires every production to have two non-terminals on the right-hand side, except for the start symbol if it produces a terminal. So having a production like NT0 -> 't23' would violate CNF. Therefore, perhaps the given grammar isn't actually in CNF, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is using a variation where non-terminals can directly produce terminals, but that would mean it's not strictly CNF. Hmm, that's confusing. Well, regardless, I need to proceed. Maybe the given grammar is just in some form, and the problem is to derive the string.\n\nBut moving on, regardless of the CNF status, I can try to see if the string can be generated by this grammar.\n\nThe string is a series of terminals separated by spaces. Each 't' is followed by numbers, which are presumably indices of the non-terminals in the grammar. But wait, looking at the grammar, each production is of the form NT number \u2192 NT another numbers, except for some that directly produce terminals like 't44' or 't54'.\n\nFor example, the production NT4 -> 't37' means that NT4 can directly produce the terminal 't37'. Similarly, others produce various terminals and non-terminals.\n\nSo, to parse the string, I need to see if each part can be generated by the grammar. The approach is to look at the string and see if each terminal can be produced by the grammar, considering the non-terminals and their productions.\n\nGiven that the string is quite long, I need a systematic way. One method is to try to break down the string from left to right, matching each part to possible productions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for the non-terminals and see if each part is part of the grammar's derivations.\n\nBut considering the time, maybe I can look for patterns or see if the string can be divided into parts that match the productions.\n\nAnother approach is to note that each non-terminal must directly or indirectly lead to the terminals in the string. So, for example, if the string starts with 't44', I can check if NT4 can produce 't44'. Looking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions: NT4 -> NT5 NT2, NT4 -> NT7 NT7, NT4 -> NT8 NT6, etc. Also, looking at later productions, there seems to be NT4 -> 't37' and others.\n\nWait, looking through the productions again, I see that NT4 has multiple rules that produce combinations of non-terminals, but nowhere does NT4 directly produce 't44', for example. Similarly, perhaps t54 is produced by NT5 or another non-terminal.\n\nWait, in the list of productions, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't47'\n\nNT7 -> 't13'\n\nNT9 -> 't60'\n\nNT8 -> 't21'\n\nNT4 -> 't37'\n\nSo, in the string, I see 't44 t54 t15...' which are quite high numbers. I'm not sure if these are directly produced by any of the non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some productions where the non-terminals directly produce these t's. Scanning through the productions again, I don't see NT4 -> 't44' or anything similar. Instead, the direct terminal productions are:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT4 -> 't37' (so t37 is from NT4)\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT9 -> 't60'\n- NT8 -> 't21'\n\nSimilarly, there's NT5 -> 't15', which is t15, and NT9 -> 't53', etc.\n\nWait, in the string, the first part is t44, which I don't see being directly produced by any non-terminal. Let me check:\n\nThe productions for NT4: NT4 -> 't37' is one, but there's also NT4 -> NT8 NT6, etc. So t44 isn't directly produced, which might mean that the string includes a terminal not present in any production's direct terminals. Therefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar because it contains a terminal that is not directly produced by any production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the string is a continuation of more non-terminals leading to these t's, but given that many of the t's are not present in the direct terminals, perhaps the string is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\nLooking at the entire list of productions, the direct terminal productions (NT x -> 't y') are:\n\n- NT4 -> 't37'\n- NT5 -> 't47', 't27', 't10'\n- NT7 -> 't13', 't54', 't70', 't73', etc.\n- NT8 -> 't21', 't5', 't73', etc.\n- NT9 -> 't60', 't5', etc.\n\nSo, 't44' is not present in any of these. Therefore, the string contains a terminal 't44' that's not directly produced by any production.

{"custom_id":"request-750","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, except for the start symbol, which can go to a terminal. However, looking at the grammar, I see that some of the productions are longer than two symbols, like S -> NT0 NT4. Wait, that doesn't fit Chomsky Normal Form. Did I read that correctly? Oh, maybe the grammar is actually in a different Normal Form or perhaps it's a variation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the user mentioned it's in Chomsky Normal Form, but looking at the productions, some are two non-terminals, which is standard, but others have more than two. For example, NT4 -> NT4 NT3 is two symbols, but NT0 -> NT9 NT7 is also two. Hmm, actually, all productions seem to be of the form NT -> something, either two NTs or a combination. So maybe it's okay, but I should confirm. Chomsky Normal Form allows productions with two non-terminals on the right. So perhaps the grammar is correct.\n\nNow, the string given is \"t9 t51 t43 t44 t43 t7 t43 t51 t60 t57 t80 t70 t53 t40 t44 t67 t70 t39 t39 t70 t76 t76 t12 t70 t12 t43 t28 t14 t70 t42 t15 t14 t84 t17 t52 t35 t15 t26 t14 t51\". That's a lot of tokens. I need to see if this string can be generated by the grammar.\n\nEach token in the string corresponds to a terminal symbol, so I can map these to the non-terminals using the productions. The start symbol is S, so I'll have to see if S can derive this string.\n\nFirst, I'll try to build a parse tree starting from S. Let's see: the first production is S -> NT0 NT4. So S produces two non-terminals, NT0 and NT4. The string starts with \"t9\", which is the first symbol. Let's see where \"t9\" comes from. Looking at the productions, I see NT7 -> 't13', which is t13, not t9. Looking through the list, NT4 has several productions. For example, NT4 -> 't5' (t5), 't8' (t8), 't9' (t9), etc. So t9 would come from NT4 -> t9. But wait, S starts with NT0, so the first symbols of the string would come from NT0. Let's see what NT0 can produce.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT0 has several options: NT0 -> NT6 NT7, NT0 -> NT9 NT7, NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc. Let's see the first token after S is t9, which is from NT4. So perhaps NT0 needs to derive something that leads to NT4.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, one of them is NT0 -> NT5 NT5. From NT5, looking at the productions, NT5 can go to NT5 NT6 or other options. Alternatively, NT0 can go to NT6 NT7. Let's see if that would lead somewhere.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to try to see if the entire string can be generated step by step.\n\nBut this might be complicated because the string is quite long. Perhaps a better approach is to reverse engineer the parse tree.\n\nStarting from the root S, which produces NT0 and NT4. The first token is t9, which comes from NT4 -> t9. So the rightmost symbol of S is NT4, which is why the string starts with t9, which is from NT4.\n\nWait, but the parse tree is built left to right, so perhaps S produces something that the string starts with. So the first symbol is t9, which is the output of NT4. So to get t9, NT4 must be the first non-terminal to be expanded in the left part.\n\nBut wait, S produces NT0 and NT4 simultaneously. So the first part of the string would come from NT0, and the second from NT4.\n\nSo let's split the string into two parts: from NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe first part starts with NT0, which must produce the sequence leading up to the first split. Wait, maybe not. Since S -> NT0 NT4, when deriving, the order would be that NT0 generates some string, and then NT4 generates another string, concatenated together.\n\nSo the entire string is the concatenation of the string generated by NT0 and the string generated by NT4.\n\nGiven that, the string starts with t9. Since S's right-hand side is NT0 and NT4, the string is split into two parts: the first part is generated by NT0, and the second by NT4.\n\nSo, the first part is the initial symbols up to some point, and the second part is the remaining symbols. But the problem is, I don't know where the split is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for the tokens that don't connect to the other part. For example, perhaps t9 is the first symbol, so that's generated by NT4 -> t9. So then, in the parse tree, S splits into NT0 and NT4, and NT4 produces t9. Then, NT0 produces the rest of the string.\n\nBut wait, the rest of the string after t9 is \"t51 t43 t44 t43 t7 t43 t51 t60 t57 t80 t70 t53 t40 t44 t67 t70 t39 t39 t70 t76 t76 t12 t70 t12 t43 t28 t14 t70 t42\". So we need to see if NT0 can generate this.\n\nLet me see how the first token after t9 is t51. So t51 would come from where? Looking at the productions, NT0 can produce NT6 NT7, among others. Let's see which non-terminals can produce t51.\n\nLooking through the productions, NT5 has a production NT5 -> NT3 NT9, and NT3 can produce t51. Looking at the list, NT3 has several productions, one of which is NT3 -> 't51' directly. So t51 is a terminal and comes from NT3. Therefore, to get t51, one of the non-terminals must be NT3.\n\nSo let's look at NT0's productions. One possible way to get t51 is through NT0 -> NT5 NT5, and then NT5 -> 't51'. So perhaps NT0 can derive somewhere that produces t51 via NT5.\n\nWait, more precisely: Let's see, NT0 can go to NT5 NT5. Then each NT5 can go to 't51', directly or indirectly. Let me check if NT5 can generate 't51'. Looking through NT5's productions, I see NT5 -> 't53', NT5 -> 't16', etc., but t51 is generated by NT3. So NT5 can produce NT3, maybe. Or is there a production directly?\n\nLooking at the productions, NT3 can go to 't51' directly. So if a non-terminal is NT3, then it can produce 't51'. So to get 't51', we need a path where a non-terminal eventually leads to 't51' via NT3.\n\nLet's see if NT3 can generate t51. Yes, NT3 has a production NT3 -> 't51'. Alternatively, it can go through other non-terminals, but since we need to confirm, let's assume it's directly.\n\nSo, perhaps the parse goes like this:\n\nS -> NT0 NT4.\n\nThe first part, NT0, generates \"t51...\" and the second part, NT4, generates \"t9...\". But wait, that's the reverse of the expected order. Because S produces NT0 followed by NT4. So the first part of the string (from NT0) would be \"t51 t43 t44 t43 t7 t43...\" and the NT4 part would be \"t9 t51...\". But that doesn't make sense because t9 is the first token, which is supposed to be from NT4. So perhaps I mixed up the order.\n\nWait, S is NT0 followed by NT4. So the entire string is the concatenation of what NT0 generates and what NT4 generates. So the first part is NT0, generating the first few tokens, and then NT4 generating the rest, including t9.\n\nWait, but the string starts with t9, which is from NT4. So the second part of the string (starting from t9) would be generated by NT4. Therefore, the first part (before t9) is generated by NT0.\n\nSo, let's split the string into two parts:\n\nPart"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-764","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) like this one are built using production rules that can be applied from left to right. Since the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), each production rule is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are non-terminals, or terminals (since it's not strictly left or right CNF, as I see some rules have terminals on the right). Wait, no, actually, in CNF, all productions must be of the form A -> BC, with B and C being non-terminals. So maybe some of these rules have terminals? Looking at the grammar, some rules do have terminals, like NT9 -> 't43'. That's a bit confusing because in standard CNF, all symbols on the right side should be non-terminals, but here some are terminals. So perhaps this isn't strictly CNF, or maybe it's a mix of forms. I'll assume it's okay for now and proceed.\n\nThe string to check is `t27 t24 t70 t53 t61 t43 t8 t33 t8 t83 t52 t31 t53 t62 t9 t26 t7 t53 t35 t53 t43 t26 t17 t63 t44 t17 t60 t7 t53 t17 t69 t11 t62 t76 t26 t33 t76 t26 t74 t26 t5`.\n\nI think the best approach is to try to derive this string from the start symbol S. But the grammar is quite large with many non-terminals and rules, so I need to see if there's a path to generate this string. Alternatively, since each production is either two non-terminals or a terminal, I can think of this as a parsing problem, where I need to construct the parse tree with the given symbols.\n\nLet's list the rules and see how they might form the string.\n\nStarting with S:\nS -> NT0 NT4\n\nSo S will generate two parts: NT0 and NT4. Each part will be a subtree in the parse tree.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a series of 't's with numbers, which are probably terminals. Let me count them:\n\nThe string has 37 't's, which means that the derivation must involve 37 terminal symbols. The starting symbol S will split into NT0 and NT4, each of which will split into their parts, and so on until we have all the terminals.\n\nSo let's see how each of these non-terminals could produce the required terms.\n\nLet's consider NT0 and NT4:\n\nNT0 produces t23, t24, t33, etc. Wait, no, actually, looking at the rules, for example, NT0 can produce different combinations, like NT9 NT7, NT9 NT5, NT5 NT5, etc. Each of these sub-productions will further split into more non-terminals until we reach terminals.\n\nSo maybe a better approach is to see if each terminal in the string can be produced by some non-terminal path.\n\nAlternatively, since the string is quite long, perhaps I can try to parse it step by step.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this as an expression where each 't' is a terminal symbol, and the indices are specific sequences. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since the grammar is context-free, perhaps we can model this as a tree, but it's going to be quite involved.\n\nAnother approach is to check if there's a path from each terminal in the string back to S.\n\nFor example, let's pick the first few terminals:\n\nFirst word is t27.\n\nLooking at the grammar, which non-terminals can produce 't27'? Looking through the rules, I notice NT15 -> t51, but that's 't51', not 't27'. Wait, let me check.\n\nIn the rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 t23 at the end: NT0 -> 't23'\n\nWait, looking through the rules:\n\nFor example, NT0 -> NT5 NT5. NT5 can produce various things, and one of them is NT6 NT7, etc. Let me think about all the rules that produce terminals.\n\nLooking through all the rules:\n\nLooking for any rule that ends with a terminal:\n\nFor example, there are a lot of production rules where a non-terminal is rewritten as two other non-terminals. So perhaps some rules directly produce a single terminal, like NT3 -> 't72', 't76', etc.\n\nWait, actually, most of the rules are of the form NTx -> NTy NTz, but some have a single terminal. For example, NT3 -> 't72', 't53', etc.\n\nSo the key is that each non-terminal can produce a single terminal or split into two non-terminals. But some non-terminals produce terminals, like NT3 can produce 't72', etc.\n\nSo the string is a sequence of terminals. To generate this string, the parser must produce all these terminals by expanding the non-terminals step by step.\n\nOne problem is that the given string is very long, so it's going to involve a lot of expansions, but I can perhaps try to find how each part can link up.\n\nLet me try to find a path for the first few terminals:\n\nFirst terminal: t27.\n\nLooking at the rules, which non-terminals can produce 't27'? Looking through, let's see:\n\n- NT27 is not a non-terminal in the grammar; wait, maybe 't27' is a terminal, so which non-terminals can produce 't27'?\n\nLooking through the production rules:\n\nWait, the non-terminals don't have 't27' as an output. The terminal symbols are in certain non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the rules, for example:\n\nNT4 \u2192 't43' is a rule, but that's a single terminal.\n\nWait, perhaps let me look for all the terminals in the string: t27, t24, t70, etc.\n\nSo I need to find if there's a non-terminal NTx that can produce 't27', 't24', etc.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\nLet me list all the non-terminals and their possible terminals and further non-terminals:\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nNT0 appears in many production rules and also on the left side:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7,NT9 NT7, NT9 NT5, NT5 NT5, etc. But wait, no terminal in NT0's production directly, except sometimes.\n\nActually, looking back, in NT0's rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23' at the end.\n\nYes! So NT0 can produce 't23'. Similarly, checking all other non-terminals for terminals:\n\nNT1: I don't see any rule for NT1 in the grammar.\n\nNT2: NT2's rules have a rule NT2 \u2192 't7' (look: in the rules, there's NT22 and other numbers, but one of the rules for NT2 is NT2 \u2192 't7' (found: 'NT2 -> 't7'). So NT2 can produce 't7' and other combinations.\n\nWait, let me scan all the rules for any non-terminals that can produce any of the required 't' terms.\n\nFor example:\n\nLooking for t27:\n\nIn the rules, looking through:\n\nI see NT13 \u2192 t54; NT4 \u2192 t13; NT3 \u2192 t53; NT7 \u2192 t70; etc.\n\nLooking for 't27', perhaps NT27 would produce 't27', but I don't see any rule with NT27.\n\nWait, no: looking at the rules, in the first part, I see NT4 can produce 't43', but that's 't43', which is not 't27'.\n\nLet me check NT3 rules: I see NT3 \u2192 't72', 't76', 't53', etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps NT5 can produce 't51' and 't33', but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps 't27' comes from NT4 \u2192 't27'?\n\nLooking through the rules:\n\nYes!

{"custom_id":"request-762","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar (CFG) presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). I'm a bit rusty on my formal language theory, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what CNF is. CNF is a form of CFG where each production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. This structure makes it easier for certain parsing algorithms, like the CYK algorithm, but since the problem is about generating a string, I might need to figure out if the string can be derived through a series of these productions.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice several production rules where non-terminals are expressed in terms of other non-terminals. For example, the start symbol S is productioned into NT0 and NT4. My first thought is that the string provided must be derived step by step from S by following these production rules.\n\nThe string given is `t31 t76 t60 t70 t53 t70 t70 t63 t79 t15 t35 t77 t43 t77 t79 t73 t39 t72 t61 t62 t70 t24 t47 t27 t14 t43 t84 t8 t20 t83 t43 t17 t12 t8 t39 t61 t77 t27 t15 t44 t7`. Each token is a 't' followed by a number, except for 't7', which is just 't7'. So, all tokens except 't7' are 't' followed by a two-digit number. \n\nLet me note that in the grammar, many of the non-terminals are defined via productions that lead to terminals. For instance, NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't47', etc. So, each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal symbol, meaning the grammar is a straight-line grammar, and the language is a regular language. However, wait, no, that's not necessarily the case because sometimes non-terminals can be left unprocessed, but in this case, every production seems to eventually terminate in terminals.\n\nWait, no, some non-terminals have productions that mix terminals and non-terminals, like NT0. For example, NT0 has rules like NT0 -> NT6 NT7, which then continue to produce more non-terminals until they hit terminal symbols. So, this grammar does lead to a string of terminals, but the exact string depends on the parse tree.\n\nBut instead of trying to parse the string with a full parser, which might be time-consuming, maybe I can work backwards using the CYK algorithm, or perhaps check the structure of the string.\n\nAnother approach is to check if the string can be built by starting from S and building the string according to the production rules.\n\nLet me first count the number of tokens in the string. The given string has 43 tokens. Now, the grammar's start symbol is S, which produces NT0 and NT4. Let me see how these can expand.\n\nLet's look at the initial productions:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo, S will generate a string that is the concatenation of what NT0 generates and NT4 generates.\n\nNow, let's see what each of these non-terminals (NT0 and NT4) can produce. NT0's definition is:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n\nSo, NT0 can be broken down into NT6 and NT7.\n\nLooking at NT6:\n\nNT6 \u2192 NT0 NT2\n\nBut NT0 can be further broken down as NT6 NT7 (same as before). This seems recursive because NT6 leads to NT0 and NT2, and NT0 leads to NT6 and NT7. So there's potential for a loop here unless some point reaches a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, NT6 can also produce NT9 NT8, according to the rules. So, if NT6 chooses this production, it's NT9 and NT8.\n\nWait, let's map out the possible paths. So NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7. So the string starts with NT6 and NT7.\n\nLet's try to expand NT6. NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8. So now, the string starts with NT9 followed by NT8.\n\nNT8 has two definitions: NT5 NT3, or NT6 NT0.\n\nWait, but looking back at the grammar, NT8 can produce NT5 NT3 or NT6 NT0. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, the grammar provided has several rules. Let me check:\n\nNT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\nNT8 \u2192 NT6 NT0\n\nSo, NT8 can be split into those options. Let me pick one.\n\nLet's take one path for NT8: say, NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3.\n\nThen, NT5 can expand in various ways, like NT5 \u2192 NT3 NT9, or NT5 \u2192 NT7 NT3, or NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6, etc.\n\nThis seems like a complex tree. Maybe I should look for the terminals in the string and see if they can be reached via the grammar.\n\nEach token is a terminal, like 't31', 't76', etc. So, let's see if the string can be partitioned into the possible terminal sequences.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that in any CFG, a way to verify if a string is generated is to check for the existence of a derivation tree that produces it. But doing this manually is time-consuming.\n\nWait, but let me see if all the tokens are present in the grammar as terminals. Looking at the grammar, the terminals are things like 't31', 't76', etc. If the grammar doesn't have certain terminal symbols, and the string uses those, then the string can't be generated.\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals seem to be: t31, t76, t60, t70, t53, etc. Each terminal is a specific string like 't23', 't34', etc.\n\nSo, first, I can check if all the terminal tokens in the string are present in the grammar.\n\nLooking at the string: every token starts with 't', then a number.\n\nIn the grammar, the terminals are defined by rules like NT4 \u2192 't37', NT6 \u2192 't83', etc. So, each non-terminal eventually leads to a terminal. Thus, the grammar does generate a string with these 't' followed by two-digit numbers.\n\nSo, the string in question uses several such terminals. So it's possible that the string is generated by this grammar.\n\nBut the problem is to determine yes or no. Since it's a complex grammar, maybe we can check if the string starts with any of the possible initial symbols and see if it can be broken down into the grammar's productions.\n\nLet me check the initial productions again:\n\nS \u2192 NT0 NT4\n\nSo, the string must be the concatenation of what NT0 generates and NT4 generates.\n\nLooking at the string, perhaps I can split it into two parts: the first part generated by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nThe string is 43 tokens long. Let's see if we can find a split point where the first part ends with NT0 and the second with NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps not, but let's try.\n\nLet me attempt to see if the first part can be matched by NT0 and the second by NT4.\n\nLooking at the first token: 't31', which is the first symbol. Let's see what NT31 can be, but wait, in the grammar, NTx are non-terminals. So, each NTx is a non-terminal. The terminals are the 't##' tokens.\n\nWait, no, in the grammar, the non-terminals are like NT0, NT1, etc., and the terminals are strings starting with 't'.\n\nSo, when I see 't31', it's a terminal, and I need to see if it's produced by any non-terminal. Let's check the rules:\n\nLooking at the grammar, I can see several rules where non-terminals produce terminals. For example, NT7 \u2192 't14', so 't14' is a terminal. Similarly, NT6 \u2192 't83', etc.\n\nSo, each terminal token in the string must be generated by a specific production from some non-terminal.\n\nSo, let's process the string step by step.\n\nThe string starts with 't31', 't76', 't60', 't70', 't53', 't70', 't70', 't63', 't79', 't15', 't35', 't77', 't43', 't77', 't79', 't73', 't39', 't72', 't61', 't62', 't70', 't24', 't47', 't27', 't14', 't43', 't84', 't8', 't20', 't83', 't43', 't17', 't12', 't8', 't39', 't61', 't"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-775","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, I'm faced with this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a context-free grammar provided in Chomsky Normal Form. The string is a sequence of tokens: `t43 t53 t8 t67 t8 t40 t35 t70 t20 t21 t33 t20 t15 t43 t77 t54 t53 t39 t47 t7 t67 t17 t56 t8 t43 t7 t40 t44 t10 t72 t31 t72 t77 t5 t44 t52 t70 t5 t8 t17 t79 t76`. \n\nFirst, I remember that Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) grammars have productions where the left-hand side is a single non-terminal, and the right-hand side is two non-terminals or a terminal. Each production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. This structure simplifies the task of parsing or generating strings, as it eliminates the need for epsilon productions and chains.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I notice that many non-terminals directly produce terminal tokens (like t43, t53, etc.). My goal is to see if the given string can be generated by left-deriving it from the start symbol S.\n\nThe start symbol is S, and according to the grammar, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the first step of any derivation must produce NT0 and NT4.\n\nI'll break down the given string into tokens:\n\n1. t43\n2. t53\n3. t8\n4. t67\n5. t8\n6. t40\n7. t35\n8. t70\n9. t20\n10. t21\n11. t33\n12. t20\n13. t15\n14. t43\n15. t77\n16. t54\n17. t53\n18. t39\n19. t47\n20. t7\n21. t67\n22. t17\n23. t56\n24. t8\n25. t43\n26. t7\n27. t40\n28. t44\n29. t10\n30. t72\n31. t31\n32. t72\n33. t77\n34. t5\n35. t44\n36. t52\n37. t70\n38. t5\n39. t8\n40. t17\n41. t79\n42. t76\n\nThe first two tokens should be from NT0 and NT4, as S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Let's look at the first two tokens: t43 and t53. \n\nLooking at the grammar, NT4 has several productions, including NT4 \u2192 t43. Also, from the list, NT4 can go directly to t43 via production `NT4 -> t43`. So the first token, t43, can be assigned to NT4.\n\nNow, the second token is t53. We need to see what NT0 can produce. Let's look at the NT0 productions. Many are two-step, but some go directly. For example, NT0 \u2192 t23, which isn't t53. However, I notice that there's a production NT0 \u2192 t53, specifically `NT0 -> t53` as per the rules. Wait, no, looking back, I see that in the grammar, there's a production for NT0: `NT0 -> t53`? Let me check the provided rules.\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nYes, there's a rule: `NT0 -> t53` (from the grammar list). So NT0 can directly produce t53.\n\nSo the first two tokens would be t43 (NT4) and t53 (NT0), which matches the first two tokens of the string. So far, so good.\n\nNow, moving past the first two tokens, the string continues with t8, t67, etc. But in this approach, I need to check if the entire string can be derived by the grammar. Since the grammar is in CNF, I can break down each production step into smaller steps, but given the string's length, this might be tedious.\n\nAnother approach is to parse the string using the grammar, keeping track of which non-terminals should replace each part.\n\nBut wait, a quicker way might be to realize that the entire string is a series of productions that need to be checked for consistency with the grammar. Since each rule is two non-terminals or a terminal, the string should be a composition of such steps.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\nThe first token is t43 (NT4), so the first part is NT4, which can be further broken down if needed, but in this case, t43 is a terminal, so no further breakdown.\n\nThe second token is t53, which is NT0. So the initial production S \u2192 NT0 NT4 directly gives the string starts with t43 t53.\n\nNow, the string is the concatenation of NT0 and NT4, each of which must produce the corresponding parts. But the full string is longer than two tokens, so there must be some way to split the rest of the string into sub-derivations starting from NT0 and NT4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial two tokens are correct, but the remaining tokens must form a way to be generated by the expansions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nBut that seems unlikely since the string is more than two tokens, so perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, no, because S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and then each of NT0 and NT4 can be expanded further. But in this case, the string is t43 t53 t8 t67 etc. But t43 is NT4, and t53 is NT0, so the next tokens (t8, t67, etc.) should come from the expansion of NT0 and NT4 further.\n\nBut let's see what the next token is after t53 in the string: t8. So the next token is t8. Which part is that produced by? Let's see:\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT0 has several productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\nNT0 \u2192 NT7 NT0\nAnd other two-non-terminal productions.\nSimilarly, in the grammar, for example, NT4 can produce t43, but also has other production rules like NT4 \u2192 nt8 nt6, but in our case, after t53 (NT0), the next token is t8, which must come from an expansion of NT0.\n\nSo, let's see: NT0 can produce NT6 NT7. Looking at the grammar, NT6 \u2192 t84, NT8 \u2192 t8, etc. Hmm, but t8 is a terminal. So perhaps NT6 can produce t8.\n\nLooking at the grammar, NT6 has various rules, for example, NT6 \u2192 t83 (immediately as a terminal). Wait, in the provided grammar, under NT6 we have:\n\nNT6 \u2192 t83\nNT6 \u2192 t77\nAnd others leading to two non-terminals.\n\nSo, if NT6 can produce the terminal t83, then that would match t8? Wait, no, because in the string, t8 is one of the tokens, but in the grammar, NT6 can produce t83, which would be a different token.\n\nWait, looking back, the string token is t8. The grammar's NT6 has a production `NT6 -> t83`, which is not a part of the string. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to parse the string step by step, ensuring each token can be derived from the grammar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to build a parse tree starting from S, expanding as per the grammar. But given the string's length, that's time-consuming.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern. Let's see: the string starts with t43, which is NT4, then t53, which is NT0, then t8, which would come from NT0 expanding further. If NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9, and then NT2 can produce t53, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let's break down the entire string into the parts derived from NT0 and NT4.\n\nThe string is 42 tokens long. Since each expansion of a non-terminal in CNF leads to a sequence of terminals and non-terminals, which eventually must all resolve to terminals, the total number of tokens should correspond correctly.\n\nIn this case, the initial expansion of S \u2192 NT0 NT4 would correspond to two sequences, each expanding into some number of tokens. The sum of tokens from NT0 and NT4 must equal 42.\n\nWait, let me count: 42 tokens total.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then the entire string must be the concatenation of the expansions of NT0 and NT4.

{"custom_id":"request-786","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to determine if a given string is generated by a certain context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, which I remember means that every production rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, and C are non-terminals and a is a terminal symbol. \n\nFirst, I should probably parse the grammar and look at the rules. The grammar starts with S and consists of several non-terminals and terminals. The terminals are the 't' followed by numbers, like 't70', 't3', etc. So the string we're evaluating contains a bunch of these terminals.\n\nThe string to evaluate is: `t70 t3 t54 t10 t79 t57 t76 t32 t43 t61 t44 t80 t53 t53 t7 t47 t51 t53 t26 t7 t39 t8 t15 t14 t51 t74 t26 t10 t7 t80 t31 t62 t53 t67 t8 t70 t63 t76 t7 t42 t77 t76 t70`.\n\nMy goal is to see if this string can be derived from the grammar starting with S. \n\nI think the best approach is to use the parsing method, perhaps a recursive descent parser, or simulate the process step by step. But that might be complicated given the size of the string and the grammar. Alternatively, I can look for a way to break down the string into parts that match the grammar rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at the first part of the string. The first symbol is 't70'. I need to see if any productions can yield 't70'. Looking at the grammar, I notice that several non-terminals directly produce 't70'. For example:\n\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5 NT3\nWait, no. Looking back, let me parse through the productions correctly. The grammar has a series of rules, each starting with NT and numbers, ending with 't' followed by numbers. Some non-terminals produce terminal symbols, while others produce other non-terminals.\n\nFor instance:\n- NT0 -> 't23'\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT6 -> 't83'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n\nAnd so on. So, 't70' doesn't directly come from any of these. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, looking again, is there a rule that produces 't70'? Let's check all the production rules. \n\nLooking through the rules:\n\n- NT7 \u2192 NT13\n- NT4 \u2192 NT32\n- NT3 \u2192 NT53\n- NT6 \u2192 NT83\n- NT5 \u2192 NT47\n- NT0 \u2192 NT23\n- NT2 \u2192 NT7\n- NT9 \u2192 NT52\n- NT8 \u2192 NT5\nHmm, I don't see a production that directly gives 't70' as a terminal. So perhaps I'm wrong. Let's check again.\n\nWait, the user input might have an error. Let me check the grammar rules again. The grammar provided has the following production rules:\n\n- S -> NT0 NT4\n- NT7 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT5 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT6 -> NT0 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT2 -> NT3 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT3 -> NT5 NT9\n- NT8 -> NT6 NT0\n- NT2 -> NT7 NT2\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT2 -> 't7'\nWait, wait a minute. Looking at the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n\nAh, yes, here it is. So NT2 can produce 't7'. So in the string, we have 't70', 't3', etc. So the first step must generate 't70'. But 't70' is a terminal, so we need to see if any production directly ends in 't70'. Or perhaps it's generated through a combination of non-terminals.\n\nWait, maybe I've misread the rules. Let me scan all the terminal productions:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\n- NT7 -> NT13\n- NT4 -> NT32\n- NT3 -> NT53\n- NT6 -> NT83\n- NT5 -> NT47\n- NT0 -> NT23\n- NT2 -> 't7'\n- NT9 -> 't52'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n- NT3 -> 't53'\n- NT5 -> 't47'\n- NT7 -> 't13'\n- NT4 -> 't32'\n- NT8 -> 't5'\n\nWait, I'm seeing some direct terminals here. For example, NT2 -> 't7', NT7 -> 't13', NT4 -> 't32', NT8 -> 't5', etc. But in the string, we have 't70' which isn't listed as a direct terminal.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe 't70' is generated through a combination of non-terminals. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the rules. Let me see: the user provided a very long list of grammar rules. Did any of them produce 't70'? Let me search the list again.\n\nLooking through all the rules, I don't see any NT directly producing 't70' as a terminal. So perhaps 't70' is not present in the grammar, which would mean the string can't be generated. But that seems unlikely because the grammar includes rules that generate terminals like 't7', 't13', 't32', etc.\n\nWait, maybe 't70' is a combination of several rules. For example, NT0 can produce 't23', which is a terminal? Wait, no. Let me check each rule again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The string includes 't70', which isn't a direct terminal in the grammar. So if 't70' can't be produced by any rule, then the string isn't in the language. But the answer is No. But wait, the string isn't impossible because some of the rules produce longer strings, or maybe 't70' is part of a longer production that eventually reduces to terminals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rules are a bit more complex, and I'm missing some production that can generate 't70' as part of a longer sequence.\n\nWait, let's try to see if any non-terminal can produce a sequence ending with 't70'. For example, maybe NT6 can produce something that includes 't70'.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n\n- NT6 -> NT7 NT9\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0 or NT4 NT6 or NT6 NT0 or NT9 NT8 or NT7 NT7\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2 or NT5 NT3 or NT2 NT7 or NT3 NT6 or NT5 NT5\n\nHmm, maybe it's part of a longer chain. Let's try to find a path that ends with 't70'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a path where NT0 produces 't23', and that's a terminal, but 't23' isn't in the string. So perhaps the string requires more complex combinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first symbol is 't70', and we need to find a way to generate it through a production. Since none of the rules directly produce 't70' as a terminal, perhaps the answer is No.\n\nBut before jumping to conclusions, perhaps I should check if 't70' can be part of a longer production that eventually reduces to a terminal. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the rules, does any non-terminal produce something that includes 't70' in a chain?\n\nLooking through:\n\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT8 -> NT5 NT3\n- NT5 -> NT9 NT6\n- NT6 -> NT9 NT8\n- NT9 -> NT5 NT2\n\nIt looks like these rules are all nested and don't include 't70' as a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 't70' is not present in the grammar's terminal symbols, so the string can't be generated.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is No.\n<\/think>\n\nNo"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The string is made up of a bunch of 't' followed by numbers, like 't27 t3 t10...' and so on. \n\nFirst, I remember that context-free grammars (CFGs) work by starting with a start symbol and applying production rules to generate strings. The grammar here is in Chomsky Normal Form, which means every production rule is of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal. \n\nLooking at the grammar, the start symbol seems to be S, and S produces NT0 and NT4. So all derivations start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4. Then, each of these NTs can produce other NTs or terminals.\n\nMy plan is to try to parse the string step by step using the grammar rules, starting from S and seeing if I can derive the string. Since the grammar is quite extensive, I might need to use a parsing technique, maybe like the CYK algorithm, but I think I'll try a more manual approach since the string is provided.\n\nLet me split the string into tokens: it's a series of 't' followed by numbers, like 't27', 't3', 't10', etc. So each token is a terminal in the grammar. \n\nLooking at the grammar rules, several symbols produce terminals or other symbols. For example, NT0 can eventually produce 't23', NT4 can produce 't37', etc. Each NT has a set of production rules leading to either other NTs or terminal symbols.\n\nI think I should start by breaking down the first part of the string. The string starts with 't27 t3 t10 t12...'. Let me see what symbols can produce 't27'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, I notice that NT0 has a rule NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, and eventually, NT0 can produce 't23'. Wait, no, the string starts with t27. Let me check NT4. NT4 has a rule NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2, and looking further, NT5 can produce 't70' or other terms. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nAlternatively, looking at NT4, there's a rule NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6. NT8 can produce 't5' and 't53', etc. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up which NTs can produce each terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the parse tree approach. Since the start symbol is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the initial step would be to multiply these two symbols. Then, each symbol is replaced according to their production rules until only terminals remain.\n\nBut manually doing this for the entire string would be time-consuming. Maybe I can look for the first few symbols and see if they can be derived from the start symbol.\n\nLooking at the first symbol: 't27'. Let's see which non-terminal can produce 't27'. Looking through the grammar, I see that NT3 \u2192 't72' via NT3 \u2192 't72' is one of the rules. Wait, no. Looking through the NT rules:\n\nLooking at NT3's production rules: I see NT3 \u2192 't72', and others like NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9, etc. Hmm, perhaps 't27' comes from another NT. Let me check NT5. NT5 has production rules like NT5 \u2192 NT9 NT6, but I don't see 't27' directly. Wait, looking further, I see NT5 \u2192 't3' (oh, rule NT5 \u2192 't3'). So that's one way. But wait, is that a terminal? Or is it part of a production?\n\nWait, no, each rule where a non-terminal becomes a terminal is terminal production, like NT5 \u2192 't3'. So if NT5 can produce 't3', that's a terminal. So 't3' is a terminal in the grammar.\n\nWait, no. Let me check the grammar again. Looking at NT5's rules:\n\nIn the grammar, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't47' (one rule)\nNT5 -> 't70' (another rule)\nAnd others that produce other NTs.\n\nWait, no, looking back:\n\nWait, in the grammar provided, for NT5, I see:\n\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT5 -> 't70'\nAnd then other rules like NT5 -> NT9 NT6, etc. So 't47' and 't70' are terminals. So when we see a 't47' or 't70', that's a terminal in the grammar.\n\nBut in the given string, I see 't27 t3 t10...'. So looking for a derivation that leads to these terms.\n\nWait, 't3' is another terminal. Looking through the grammar, I see NT3 \u2192 't72' directly, but also NT3 has rules like NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9. So 't3' could come from NT3 if there's a production rule that ends with 't3'.\n\nWait, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me list all the terminal productions in the grammar to see which 't's are possible:\n\nLooking through the grammar, the terminals are:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n- NT8 \u2192 't11'\n- NT3 \u2192 't53'\n- NT5 \u2192 't3' (Yes, here's 't3')\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT7 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5' (Wait, is that correct? Looking back, I see:\n\nNT4 has rules like NT4 \u2192 NT3 NT7 and NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, etc. Wait, I'm looking at this: \n\nLooking for any production where the non-terminal becomes exactly 't3', 't5', etc.\n\nWait, in the grammar, I see:\n\n- NT5 \u2192 't47'\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT8 \u2192 't53'\n- NT5 \u2192 't70'\n- NT7 \u2192 't13'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32'\n- NT7 \u2192 't43'\n- NT4 \u2192 't5' (Yes, NT4 \u2192 't5')\n- NT8 \u2192 't57'\n- NT4 \u2192 't8' is another one, NT4\u2192't8'\nWait, no, in the grammar, I see NT4 \u2192 't5', 't32', 't57', 't84', etc. Also, looking at NT5, I see NT5 \u2192 't3'. So NT5 can produce 't3' as a terminal.\n\nSo in the string, we have 't3' as the second symbol.\n\nSo, the derivation needs to generate 't27', 't3', 't10', etc.\n\nLet me try to find a path for each token. Starting with 't27'.\n\nLooking for which NT can produce 't27'. Scanning through the grammar, I see that NT0 \u2192 't23', NT5 \u2192 't3', NT4 has some terminals like 't43', 't5', 't32', etc.\n\nWait, looking for 't27', perhaps NT7? Let's see.\n\nLooking at NT7's production rules: NT7 \u2192 NT4 NT0, etc., but are there any terminal production for NT7?\n\nLooking back at the grammar, do any NT7 rules result in a terminal? I don't see that. All NT7's are either combinations of other NTs or are part of larger productions. Wait, here's NT7 \u2192 't13' is one of the rules.\n\nYes, in the grammar, I see NT7 \u2192 't13' (another line). So NT7 can produce 't13'.

{"custom_id":"request-798","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, let's see. I need to determine whether the given string can be generated by the provided context-free grammar. The grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it has specific structures that might make parsing easier. \n\nFirst, I should recall that in CNF, every production is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a, where A, B, C are non-terminal symbols and a is a terminal symbol. Looking at the given grammar, it seems to fit this structure. For example, S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and other productions like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, etc., all follow the rule of two non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nThe string to evaluate is a series of terminals separated by spaces: `t28 t24 t67 t20 t43 t17 t60 t10 t7 t15 t47 t7 t14 t26 t57 t60 t56 t27 t76 t7 t51 t76 t35 t40 t62 t43 t80 t17 t14 t31 t37 t51 t14 t69 t77 t43 t62 t35 t51 t5 t8 t63 t79 t63`.\n\nEach token in the string is a terminal. So, the problem is essentially to see if this sequence can be derived from the start symbol S by applying productions in the grammar.\n\nI'll start by looking for start symbol S in the grammar. The first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So, S produces two non-terminals NT0 and NT4. Both must be expanded further into terminals or non-terminals.\n\nTo parse the string, we can construct a derivation starting with S. Let's see if the string can be broken down into the two parts generated by NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t28. So, if NT0 is the first part, it should derive to t28 somewhere. Alternatively, if NT4 is the first part, it should derive to t28.\n\nWait, but NT0 and NT4 are non-terminals, so they need to be expanded. Let me check what NT0 and NT4 can produce.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has several productions:\n\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT3 NT6\nNT4 \u2192 NT4 NT3\nNT4 \u2192 NT8 NT7\nNT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2\nNT4 \u2192 NT27 (from NT4 -> 't27')\n\nWait, hold on. I notice that NT4 can directly produce 't27'. Similarly, other non-terminals may produce terminals directly. So, the strategy is to check if the string can be split into the two parts from NT0 and NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, the first token is t28. Let's see which NT can produce t28:\n\nLooking through the non-terminals, I don't see any production that directly gives 't28'. Wait, but maybe through a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps t28 is part of a derivation that's more complex.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the grammar is in CNF, perhaps I can use the fact that each production splits the string into two parts (in the case of non-terminals) and each terminal is a step in the derivation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can construct a parse tree by working backwards. Let's think about how the string can be built up.\n\nThe string starts with t28. So, the first non-terminal in the expansion of S must produce t28 as the first part. Looking at NT0's productions, do any of them produce t28 in their first step? Looking back, NT0 has productions ending with NT6, NT7, etc., but looking at their expanded forms, perhaps through leftmost derivations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string is generated by NT0 and NT4, and each of these has their own sub-derivations. Let's consider that.\n\nLooking at the string, it's a long sequence of t's. Let me check if the string can be broken into two parts, first part derived from NT0 and the second from NT4.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to see if the entire string can be formed by the two non-terminals. Let's note that the entire string is long, so it's a matter of correctly expanding the non-terminals to match the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to look for possible substrings that match the productions. For example, looking for chains that fit certain terminals.\n\nAnother point is to see if each terminal in the string matches a production rule for some non-terminal. For example, t28 is in the string; looking through all non-terminals, I don't see one with t28 as a terminal. Wait, that can't be right because all the non-terminals are expanded into certain sequences, and t28 is one of those sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me look again at the grammar. Each production's RHS is either non-terminals or a single terminal (a, t, etc.). So, when we expand a non-terminal, each step reduces it to terminals or more non-terminals.\n\nWait, perhaps in the given grammar, some non-terminals directly produce specific terminals. For example, looking back, I see:\n\n- NT4 has a production NT4 \u2192 t27\n- Similarly, other non-terminals produce specific terminals as well.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the grammar rules, for example:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't23' (from the rules)\nWait, looking at the grammar, there are rules like:\n\nNT0 -> 't23'\nNT5 -> 't33'\nNT7 -> 't13'\n...and so on.\n\nWait, I need to check all the rules where a non-terminal is directly mapped to a terminal.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT3 -> 't72' (from NT3 -> 't72')\nNT3 -> 't39' (from NT3 -> 't39')\nNT5 -> 't47'\nNT7 -> 't14'\nNT0 -> 't28' (Wait, looking again, actually, it's in the list:\n\nLooking at the grammar:\n\nNT0 \u2192 't28'\n\nYes! There is a rule NT0 \u2192 't28'. So, that means when NT0 is being expanded, it can directly produce t28. Similarly, there are other rules where NT0 \u2192 't40' etc., but in this case, the first part of the string starts with t28, which would mean that the leftmost symbol in S's production is NT0, which expands directly to t28.\n\nBut wait, S's first production is S \u2192 NT0 NT4, so S starts with NT0. So, the first part of the string, t28, must come from NT0. Then, after that, the string continues with t24, t67, etc., which would come from the second part, NT4.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, S expands into NT0 NT4. So, first, NT0 should be expanded to t28, and then NT4 should be expanded into the rest of the string: t24 t67 t20 t43 t17 t60 t10 t7 t15 t47 t7 t14 t26 t57 t60 t56 t27 t76 t7 t51 t76 t35 t40 t62 t43 t80 t17 t14 t31 t37 t51 t14 t69 t77 t43 t62 t35 t51 t5 t8 t63 t79 t63.\n\nWait, but that's a lot of symbols. So, first, after NT0 becomes t28, the next part is NT4 producing the rest of the string. So, the question is: can NT4 directly produce the entire remaining part of the string? Or perhaps NT4 is further expanded into NT4 NT4, and so on.\n\nWait, but looking at the grammar, NT4 can have productions that are NT8 NT6 or NT5 NT2, etc. So, to see if the string starting with t24 can be produced by NT4, we need to check if there's a way for NT4 to derive that sequence.\n\nWait, but in the grammar, are any of these non-terminals directly producing t24? I don't see any direct productions for t24. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first symbol t28 comes from NT0, and the rest comes from NT4, which in turn is expanding further.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should approach this more systematically. Let me try to see if t28 appears in the grammar.\n\nLooking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't28' (Yes)\n- NT5 \u2192 't33'\n- NT7 \u2192 't14'\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n-"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

The given grammar is in CNF because all productions on the right have exactly two non-terminals, except for some like NT3 -> 't72', which are terminals directly. Wait, but in CNF, all productions should be of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where a is a terminal. So looking at the grammar, yes, it seems to fit because all the productions either have two non-terminals or a single terminal.\n\nNow, the string I need to check is a sequence of these terminal tokens. So the question is whether this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the productions step by step.\n\nThe string is: `t14 t27 t83 t62 t7 t43 t14 t3 t51 t53 t79 t28 t22 t33 t39 t33 t53 t8 t44 t63 t7 t26 t43 t43 t27 t70 t33 t47 t14 t7 t62 t63 t60 t15 t76 t67 t43 t7 t79 t81 t53 t17 t23 t44 t43 t7`.\n\nThe first token is 't14'. Looking at the grammar, 't14' is a terminal. Let me check where it appears.

So each 't...' is a terminal, and the rest are non-terminals. So each production is either a non-terminal producing two other non-terminals or a terminal.\n\nTo parse the string, I need to find a derivation starting from S and ending at this string. The string has 43 tokens. Let's count how many steps that would take. Since each production can produce two non-terminals, the length of the string can be analyzed by counting the number of non-terminals in the derivation.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to build a parse tree or use dynamic programming to see if each token can be generated from the corresponding part of the grammar.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to work backwards. Start from the leftmost symbol and see if I can find a production that matches the beginning. For example, the string starts with 't14'. Let's see if any non-terminal directly produces 't14'.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see:\n\nNT2 -> 't7'\nWait no, maybe I'm mixing NT and NT. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the NTs are the non-terminals. I need to find a non-terminal that can derive 't14' in one step. Looking through the productions:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT7 -> NT4 NT0\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3 (Wait, this is ambiguous because NT4 has multiple productions)\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, I can see each 't' token is produced by a specific NT. Let me map which NT produces each 't'.\n\nLooking through the grammar, each 't' is generated by one NT:\n\n- 't14' is generated by... looking for NT such that NT production ends with 't14'. Looking through:\n\nLooking at the list:\n\nLooking for 't...'\n\nFor example, NT2 -> 't7', so 't7' is from NT2. Similarly, NT5 -> 't47', so 't47' is from NT5.\n\nLooking at the string: the first token is 't14'. Let's look for an NT that can produce 't14'.\n\nWait, perhaps none of the NTs directly produce 't14'. Let me check all productions:\n\nLooking through the list, I don't see any NT with a production ending in 't14'. For example, NT0 -> 't23' so 't23' is from NT0.\n\nWait, let's look again:\n\n- NT0 -> 't23' (Yes)\n- NT5 -> 't33' (Yes)\n- NT4 -> 't84' (Yes)\n- NT2 -> 't27' etc.\n\nWait, I don't see any NT that produces 't14'. So 't14' cannot be derived because there's no NT that can produce it in one step.\n\nWait, but perhaps in more steps. For example, if some NT derives 't14t...', but no, because in each step, a NT can only produce terminals, not an entire string. Each production is either two NTs or a terminal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping. Maybe I should try to see which NT can generate 't14'.\n\nLooking again:\n\nWait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me check the NT productions:\n\nLooking through each production:\n\nLooking for 't14' as a terminal:\n\nLooking for if any NT has a production to 't14'.\n\nBut looking through the list, I don't see any NT with a production ending with 't14'. For example, NT9 -> 't60', so 't60' is from NT9.\n\nSo 't14' is being used as the first token, but there's no NT that directly produces 't14'. Therefore, it's impossible for the string to be derived from S because the first symbol 't14' can't be produced directly or indirectly by any non-terminal.\n\nTherefore, the string cannot be generated by the grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-830","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. It's in Chomsky Normal Form, which means each production rule has exactly two non-terminal symbols on the right-hand side. The start symbol is S, which expands into NT0 NT4. So, the first step is to see how the string starts.\n\nThe string starts with 't83 t33 t8 t54...'. The initial symbol in the grammar is S, which becomes NT0 NT4. Looking at the rules for NT0 and NT4:\n\n- NT0 can go to NT9 NT7 or NT0 NT7 (in some places) or others.\n- NT4 can go to NT8 NT6 or other combinations.\n\nLet me track the first part of the string: 't83 t33 t8...'. The first symbol is 't83'. Looking back at the grammar, I see NT6 -> 't83', so maybe NT6 is part of the initial rule.\n\nWait, the starting rule is S -> NT0 NT4. So the first part comes from NT0. Let me check if 't83' comes from NT0. Looking at NT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7 or other combinations. But in the rules, NT0 expands to things like NT9 NT7, NT6 NT7, etc. Wait, looking more carefully, NT0 has a production NT0 -> NT6 NT7, which would mean 't83' comes from NT0 -> NT6 NT7, so NT6 would be 't83'.\n\nBut NT6 has a production NT6 -> 't61' or others. Wait, in the rules, NT6 has several options. One of them is NT6 -> 't83', so 't83' could be from NT6.\n\nThen, after 't83', the next symbols are 't33', which is 't33' from NT7 or NT4.\n\nLooking at the rules, NT7 is part of the initial S as NT7 and NT4. Let me see:\n\nThe initial S is NT0 NT4. From the first step, I assumed NT0 produces 't83', so 't83' is from NT0, which then produces NT6 and NT7. So, after 't83', the next symbols should come from NT7.\n\nNT7's rules include NT7 -> 't76' (from the rules, as NT7->'t76' or other NT combinations). So 't33' could be from another path.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by traversing the string and seeing how each part can be generated.\n\nThe string is: t83 t33 t8 t54 t76 t10 t63 t70 t7 t62 t69 t44 t77 t43 t57 t7 t9 t61 t32 t43 t26 t43 t33 t10 t43 t54 t40 t79 t43 t44 t10 t79 t21 t26 t60 t57 t9 t43 t70 t14 t76 t80 t7 t14 t76 t70 t31.\n\nThat's a lot, but let's take it one symbol at a time.\n\nThe first symbol is 't83'. From NT0's production, NT0 has a rule where it can produce NT6 NT7. And NT6 has a production for 't83'. So after NT0 produces 't83', what's next?\n\nWait, the initial S is NT0 NT4, so we have NT0 and NT4 both to produce. NT0 produces something, and NT4 produces something else, and together they form the string.\n\nWait, maybe we should think in terms of a parse tree. The root is S, which is NT0 NT4. So the string is the concatenation of whatever NT0 produces and whatever NT4 produces.\n\nLooking at the first symbol, it's 't83', which is likely from NT0's expansion.\n\nSo let's focus on NT0. NT0 can expand into several options. Looking at the rules:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT8 (but that's further down, maybe?)\nWait, looking at the rules, NT0 has a production: NT0 -> NT0 NT7 (I think I might have miscounted earlier). Wait, in the rules given, I see a line: \"NT0 -> NT9 NT7\" and another: \"NT0 -> NT6 NT7\". But also, \"NT0 -> NT5 NT5\". And \"NT0 -> NT5 NT5\" is another production.\n\nWait, no, let me check:\n\nLooking through the rules, under NT0, I see:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- Also, \"NT0 -> NT0 NT7\" (from \"NT4 -> NT0 NT7\" might be a different rule, but I think NT0's own rules). Wait, no, under NT0, the rule is \"NT0 -> NT0 NT7\" under NT4's rules? Or is that a different rule? Wait, maybe I need to parse all the rules again.\n\nLooking through all the NT0 rules:\n\nLooking at the provided grammar, under NT0, the rules are:\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n- NT0 -> NT5 NT5\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT9\n- NT0 -> NT2 NT6\nWait, no, let me go through each line:\n\nActually, after a while, I see:\n\n\"NT0 -> NT5 NT5\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT9\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT6\"\n\nWait, but this might be under NT2 or NT0. Hmmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, in the grammar, for NT0, the rules are:\n\n- NT0 -> NT6 NT7\n\n- NT0 -> NT9 NT7\n\n- NT0 -> NT0 NT8 (Wait, no, looking at the rules again: \"NT0 -> NT0 NT7\"? Or was that NT4's rule? Let's check:\n\nWait, in the provided grammar, one line is \"NT4 -> NT0 NT7\" so maybe NT0's rule is NT0 -> NT0 NT7 is under some other part. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misread.\n\nWait, let's parse all the NT0 rules from the provided grammar:\n\nLooking at each line:\n\n\"NT0 -> NT6 NT7\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT9 NT7\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT0 NT7\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT9\"\n\n\"NT0 -> NT2 NT6\"\n\nSo, as per the grammar, NT0 can be:\n\n- NT6 NT7 \u2192 't83' followed by something else.\n\nBut wait, in the string, after 't83' is 't33', so after 't83', there's 't33'. Let me see what 't33' could be.\n\nLooking at the NT7 rules: 't33' could be from NT7.\n\nLooking at NT7's rules, for example, \"NT7 -> 't33'\".\n\nWait, in the rules, one of the NT7 productions is \"NT7 -> 't76'\". Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the parse tree step by step.\n\nStarting with S -> NT0 NT4.\n\nNT0 expands first. Let's choose one of the options for NT0. The first symbol is 't83', so looking for how 't83' is generated.\n\nLooking for NT0's rules that produce 't83':\n\nFrom the rules, \"NT0-> NT6 NT7\" can produce 't83' because NT6's production is \"NT6->'t83'\".\n\nSo, one possibility is NT0 expands as NT6 NT7, producing 't83' as the first symbol.\n\nThen, the next part comes from NT4.\n\nBut wait, after NT0 is NT4. So the next part of the string is 't33', which is the second symbol.\n\nSo from NT4's perspective, how do we get 't33'?\n\nLooking at NT4's rules, 't33' could be part of some production. Wait, looking at the rules, I don't see 't33' directly. Maybe it's more complicated.\n\nWait, let me think again. The initial S is NT0 NT4. If NT0 is 't83', then what does NT4 produce? The second symbol is 't33', so we need NT4 to produce 't33' after.\n\nLooking at NT4's rules:\n\n- NT4 -> NT8 NT6\n- NT4 -> NT5 NT2\n- NT4 -> NT4 NT3\n- NT4 -> NT2 nt7\n- NT4-> others... Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps after NT0 produces 't83' (which is NT6"}}],"messages":[{"content":"You will be presented with a context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form and a string which may or may not be in the language defined by the given grammar.

{"custom_id":"request-841","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Okay, I need to figure out if the given string is generated by the provided context-free grammar. The string is quite long, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note that the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which means each rule is of the form A \u2192 BC or A \u2192 a. That should help because we can use the CYK algorithm or recursive descent parsing to determine if the string is in the language.\n\nThe grammar consists of several non-terminal symbols: S, NT0, NT1, NT2, NT3, NT4, etc., since I noticed some rules like NT5->NT5 NT2. Wait, some of the NT symbols might be lowercase and others uppercase, but I think in this case, it's a mix. But maybe the uppercase T0 to T9 are specific terminals, and the NTs are the non-terminals.\n\nLooking at the string: \"t5 t57 t43 t43 t70 t43 t17 t79 t17 t40 t74 t64 t15 t15 t61 t54 t47 t27 t77 t28 t54 t51 t20 t84 t57 t60 t76 t43 t14 t7 t53 t20 t11 t69 t77 t33 t12 t76 t24 t31 t40 t70 t10 t43 t3 t79 t26 t51\".\n\nI notice that the entire string is made up of these terms like t5, t43, etc. So I'll assume that each token is a terminal symbol. \n\nIn CNF, each production is either a single terminal or two non-terminals. So, to parse the string, each step should split the string into the smallest possible sub-strings according to the grammar.\n\nSince I need to check if the entire string can be derived, I'll need to see if each part can be covered by the grammar.\n\nLet me list some of the productions:\n\n- S \u2192 NT0 NT4\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, NT9 NT7, NT5 NT5, etc.\n- NT4 \u2192 NT8 NT6, NT5 NT2, etc.\n- Many other productions, but I need to see if the string can be split according to these.\n\nI can try to break down the string into parts starting from the start symbol S, which is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So the string starts with t5, so maybe NT0 starts with t5? Or maybe NT4 starts with t57, etc.\n\nWait, the initial rule is S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So after S, the string is divided into two parts: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT4. So the string should start with NT0 and end with NT4.\n\nLooking at the string, starting with t5, then t57, etc. Let me see the first two terms: t5 and t57.\n\nBut wait, using the CYK algorithm, we break the string into parts recursively. The first step is to check if the entire string can be generated by S. That requires the first part (NT0) to generate the prefix and the second part (NT4) to generate the suffix.\n\nSo, let's consider the entire string as the product of NT0 and NT4. That is, the entire string should be split into two sub-strings: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT4.\n\nThe first character is t5. So NT0's production must start with t5. Looking at the productions for NT0, perhaps looking for where NT0 starts with t5. Wait, looking at the rules for NT0, they are long. For example:\n\nNT0 -> NT6 NT7, but in some other rules, like NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5, etc. Then, terminal symbols. For example, looking for any production that starts with t5. Wait, in the list of productions, I see NT3 \u2192 't53', but that's a terminal. Also, NT0 has rules where it can produce terminals like 't23', 't28', 't43', etc.\n\nWait, looking for a production for NT0 that starts with t5. Looking through the list, I don't immediately see any rule for NT0 that starts with t5 as a terminal. The NT0 non-terminals produce pairs of other NTs, but none of those end in a terminal t5. So maybe the first t5 is part of a larger non-terminal production.\n\nWait, perhaps the NT0 rule has a production that includes a terminal. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the grammar, I see that NT4 has a production: NT4 \u2192 't37'. Similarly, NT0 \u2192 't23', 't28', etc. So perhaps one of the productions for NT0 starts with 't5'.\n\nLooking back: Oh, wait! I don't see any production for NT0 that starts with 't5' as a terminal. All the productions for NT0 are either rules like NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7 or producing terminals like 't23', 't28', etc. But I don't see any starting with t5.\n\nWait, so maybe the initial S \u2192 NT0 NT4 doesn't produce the string starting with t5. Because if NT0 can't produce a t5 as a terminal, then the start would be a problem. But that can't be right because the string starts with t5. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the NT0 can derive into a sequence that includes t5. Let me look through the productions again.\n\nLooking at NT0: It has a production that ends with t5? Or starts with t5? For instance, I see NT0 \u2192 \"t23\", but not t5. Wait, looking for a rule where NT0 starts with t5 or includes t5 as a terminal.\n\nWait, looking again at the productions:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\nSo all these are non-terminals. Also, I don't see a production where NT0 starts with 't5' as a terminal. So maybe this string cannot start with NT0, or perhaps the NT0 production includes t5 in a longer expansion.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the production for NT0 includes a path that eventually leads to a terminal. For example, NT0 could be NT6 NT7, and NT6 could produce terminals, etc. So maybe the first part after the initial split can generate t5 through some expansion.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this differently. Let's try to split the string into possible NT0 and NT4 parts.\n\nThe entire string is 47 tokens long. So, to check if it's generated by S \u2192 NT0 NT4, the string must be split into two parts: one generated by NT0 and the other by NT4. Let's assume the first k tokens are generated by NT0, and the remaining 47 -k are generated by NT4. We need to find if there's a k where this is possible.\n\nBut since the grammar is in CNF, the splits might have to consider multiple layers. Alternatively, using the CYK algorithm, which determines the possible positions in the grammar.\n\nBut doing CYK manually would be tedious for a 47-token string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can look for the structure of the string. Let's look at the string:\n\nt5, t57, t43, t43, t70, t43, t17, t79, t17, t40, t74, t64, t15, t15, t61, t54, t47, t27, t77, t28, t54, t51, t20, t84, t57, t60, t76, t43, t14, t7, t53, t20, t11, t69, t77, t33, t12, t76, t24, t31, t40, t70, t10, t43, t3, t79, t26, t51.\n\nObserving that the string starts with t5, which could be part of a longer NT0 production, but if there's no direct t5 in NT0's terminals, maybe this is a NO.\n\nWait, wait. Looking again at the production rules for NT0:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- Also, NT0 can produce direct terminals like 't23', 't28', etc., but not 't5'.\n\nSo the first token t5 must be derived from some production that eventually leads to t5.

The string is: t43 t73 t3 t7 t69 t15 t24 t8 t47 t47 t5 t3 t8 t43 t39 t77 t23 t10 t83 t13 t62 t43 t13 t43 t83 t69 t83 t22 t60 t11 t27 t10 t84 t79 t5 t33 t27 t28 t43 t20 t80 t72 t43 t73 t13 t12 t44 t14 t8.\n\nFirst, I recall that a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) has productions where the left side is a single non-terminal, and the right side is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, all productions are of the form A -> BC or A -> a, where A, B, C are non-terminals and a is a terminal.\n\nLooking at the grammar provided, I see that all the productions are either two non-terminals on the right or a single terminal. Even though some non-terminals have multiple production rules, each production only results in terminals. This suggests that the grammar can be used to derive strings by repeatedly replacing non-terminals with terminals until the string consists only of terminals.\n\nNow, the string starts with 't43' and ends with '8', which is a terminal. I need to see if each consecutive pair of terminals in the string can be generated by the grammar. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for possible derivations step by step.\n\nBut since this is a lengthy string, perhaps a better approach is to check if each terminal in the string is allowed in the start symbol's production. Alternatively, since the grammar is in CNF, each production is two symbols. However, sometimes sequences can be derived through multiple steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the structure of the grammar. Let me try to see if each step in the string can correspond to some non-terminal's production.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a parse tree where each non-terminal is expanded based on the grammar rules.\n\nLet me think about the start symbol, which is S. Looking at the productions, S is initially defined as S -> NT0 NT4. So, starting with NT0 and NT4. Then each of those can be replaced by their respective productions.\n\nWait, let me see the productions:\n\nS starts as NT0 NT4.\n\nNT0 has several productions. For example, NT0 -> NT6 NT7, or NT0 -> NT5 NT5, etc.\n\nSimilarly, NT4 has several productions, such as NT4 -> NT8 NT6, NT4 -> NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nBut to avoid getting lost in the tree, perhaps I can see if each terminal is allowed in the substitution paths.\n\nWait, each production either leads to terminals or other non-terminals. So, the process of parsing the string involves checking if each part can be broken down into these components.\n\nBut given the string length, it's tedious to check each pair. Maybe I can look for patterns or repeated units.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can check if each terminal is a terminal in some production. Looking at the string, all the parts are 't's followed by numbers, and each of these numbers seems to have specific productions that might correspond to the grammar.\n\nWait, perhaps each 't' is a terminal, and for each 'tXX', I need to see if that can be derived from some non-terminal.\n\nBut looking at the productions, many of them directly produce a terminal with a specific number. For example, NT3 -> 't72', NT5 -> 't47', and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the grammar allows certain terminals to be derived based on specific non-terminals.\n\nLet me take the first part of the string: t43 t73 t3 t7...\n\nLooking at the production where S is NT0 NT4. So, S starts as NT0 and NT4.\n\nFrom S, the first step is S\u2192NT0 NT4.\n\nNow, I need to see what NT0 and NT4 can produce. Let me look into the productions of NT0 and NT4.\n\nNT0 can produce, for example, NT6 NT7, or NT5 NT5, etc. Similarly, NT4 can produce NT8 NT6, or NT5 NT2, etc.\n\nBut to match the string, perhaps I should see if, for the first 't43', which is in the string, can come from one of these productions.\n\nLooking at the productions for NT6, for example, I see NT6 \u2192 NT9 NT8, or NT6 \u2192 NT7 NT9, etc. But none directly produce 't43'. Wait, looking at the end of the grammar, NT0 \u2192 't43' is one of the options for NT0.\n\nSo, if NT0 produces 't43', that would correspond to 't43'.\n\nThen, the next part is 't73'. Let's see. For those, perhaps NT4 is involved. Looking at NT4, one of its productions is NT5 NT2. NT5 can produce various things, including 't47' or 't3'.\n\nWait, let me think step by step.\n\nLet me imagine the derivation:\n\n1. Start with S \u2192 NT0 NT4.\n\n2. Now, we need to expand NT0 and NT4. Let's see what can produce 't43' first.\n\nLooking at NT0's productions, one is NT0 \u2192 't43'. So, perhaps NT0 expands to 't43'.\n\nThen, NT4 can be expanded further. The string continues with 't73', so perhaps NT4 is responsible for that.\n\nLooking at NT4's productions, one is NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Let's expand that.\n\nSo, NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2.\n\nNow, we need to expand NT5 and NT2.\n\nLooking at NT5, one of its productions is NT5 \u2192 't47'. So, if NT5 produces 't47', perhaps this leads to a 't47' in the string.\n\nBut the next part of the string is 't73', so maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, perhaps NT3 is involved. Let me check if 't73' can come from any production.\n\nLooking at NT3's productions, one is NT3 \u2192 't72', another is NT3 \u2192 't76', etc. Hmm, none directly gives 't73'. Alternatively, NT8 has a production NT8 \u2192 't5', but not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of how the grammar can generate sequences of terminals.\n\nWait, another approach: since all productions are in CNF, each production is two non-terminals or a terminal. So, derivation steps involve replacing non-terminals with their two-symbol (in non-terminal or terminal) components.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire string is derived by a series of steps where non-terminals are expanded until all are terminals.\n\nGiven the string's length, this would be challenging, but let me try to see if each pair of terminals can be constructed based on the grammar.\n\nLooking at the first two terminals: 't43' 't73'.\n\nIf S \u2192 NT0 NT4, and NT0 \u2192 't43', and NT4 \u2192 something that gives 't73'. How?\n\nWait, let's say NT4 \u2192 NT5 NT2. Then, for NT5 \u2192 't47', but that doesn't help. Alternatively, NT4 \u2192 't43' somehow, but NT4's productions don't include that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first parts involve NT3 or other non-terminals. Let me check if any NT can produce 't43' and 't73' in sequence.\n\nLooking at the productions, NT14 isn't mentioned, so probably not. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to note that each non-terminal may only produce certain terminals. So, for example, certain non-terminals correspond to specific terminals.\n\nLooking through the list:\n\nNT0: can produce 't43' among other terminals.\nNT4: some options produce 't47' or 't3' etc.\nNT7: 't13', 't43', etc.\nNT3: 't72', 't76', etc.\nNT6: 't83', 't9', etc.\nNT8: 't5', 't11', etc.\nNT9: 't20', 't60', etc.\nNT5: 't47', 't27', etc.\nNT2: 't7', 't26', etc.\n\nSo, looking at the first terminals:\n\nFirst is 't43', which can be from NT0, or NT6, or NT7, or NT8, etc. Wait, specifically, NT6 has NT6 \u2192 't83', which isn't 't43'. Looking again, NT0 can produce 't43'.\n\nNext is 't73'. Hmm. Wait, is 't73' an allowed terminal? Looking at the end of the grammar, I don't see any NT producing 't73' directly. Hmm.

{"custom_id":"request-852","response":{"body":{"choices":[{"message":{"content":"Alright, so I've got this problem where I need to determine whether a given string is generated by a specific context-free grammar. The grammar is presented in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is helpful because it simplifies the rules, and each production is either to two terminals or two non-terminals. \n\nThe given string is a sequence of symbols separated by spaces. My goal is to see if this string can be derived from the start symbol S by applying the grammar's productions step by step. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the grammar structure. The start symbol is S, and according to the first rule, S \u2192 NT0 NT4. So initially, the string must start with the productions of NT0 and NT4. Let's verify if the given string starts with a combination that could correspond to these NT0 and NT4 productions.\n\nLooking at the string: `t39 t31 t33 t76 t51 t28 t40 t20 t61 t20 t43 t43 t37 t70 t43 t70 t53 t44 t53 t7 t33 t7 t40 t53 t26 t43 t76 t13 t10 t14 t11 t57 t64 t10 t63 t60 t33 t70 t35 t10 t53 t53 t43 t10 t43 t72 t83 t26 t13`.\n\nThe first symbol is t39. Since S starts with NT0 and NT4, I need to see which NT0 and NT4 rules can produce t39. Looking at the grammar, I see that NT0 has several productions. Let me list out the possible NT0 rules:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7\n- NT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT2 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT9\n- NT0 \u2192 NT3 NT6\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT8\n- NT0 \u2192 NT0 NT7\n- etc.\n\nWait, the string starts with t39. Let me check which NT0 and NT4 rules can lead to t39.\n\nLooking at the NT3 productions:\n\n- NT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0\n- NT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3\n- etc.\n\nWait, no, NT3 isn't the start here. The start is NT0 and NT4.\n\nWait, maybe I should track which non-terminals in the grammar produce terminals. For example, looking at NT0 productions, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' (multiple times)\n- Similarly, NT2 \u2192 't7'\n- NT3 \u2192 't72'\n- NT4 \u2192 't32', 't37', etc.\n- NT5 \u2192 't47', etc.\n- NT6 \u2192 't83'\n- NT7 \u2192 't54', etc.\n- NT8 \u2192 't5', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't60', etc.\n\nSo each of these non-terminals can produce specific terminals. To generate the string, I need to see if the sequence can be broken down into such terminals through the productions.\n\nLet me try to see the structure of the string. The string starts with t39 t31 t33 t76 t51 t28 t40 t20 t61 t20 t43 t43... and so on.\n\nHmm, t39 is a terminal from NT3: NT3 \u2192 't72'. Wait, but t39 isn't directly a terminal in the given NT3 productions. Let me check:\n\nWait, in the grammar given, under NT3, we have:\n\nNT3 -> 't72' (twice), and also some rules involving other NTs, like:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9,\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0,\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3,\nand so on. \n\nSo t39 isn't directly a terminal for NT3. That suggests that perhaps this grammar might not have a production that directly produces t39. Let me check other sections.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's look through the grammar again.\n\nLooking through the grammar rules, I see:\n\n- NT0 \u2192 't23' multiple times\n- NT1 isn't present? Wait, the grammar given only has NT0 to NT9 maybe. Let me check: the initial rules are S \u2192 NT0 NT4, then various NTx rules.\n\nWait, the grammar has NT0, NT1? No, looking through the rules, I only see NT0, NT2, NT3, etc., up to NT9 maybe. Let me list all the NTs present:\n\nNT0, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9.\n\nWait, I don't see NT1 in the grammar, but in the string, the first symbol is t39, which doesn't have an NT1. So, perhaps the presence of t39 implies that the grammar has an NT1 that produces it. But in the given grammar, I don't see NT1 defined. So that could be a problem. Because if the grammar doesn't have a rule that NT1 can produce 't39', then t39 can't appear in any string generated by this grammar. \n\nWait, let me check the grammar again. Yes, the rules listed start from NT0, NT2, NT3, NT4, NT5, NT6, NT7, NT8, NT9. No NT1. So if the string starts with t39, which would have to come from NT1, but since NT1 isn't defined, that string can't be generated. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I misunderstood. Alternatively, perhaps the NT0 can expand into a chain that eventually produces t39 through some rules. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the NT0 rules:\n\nNT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7,\nNT0 \u2192 NT5 NT5,\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT7,\nNT0 \u2192 NT9 NT6,\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT9,\nNT0 \u2192 NT2 NT6,\nand so on.\n\nIf I can chain these together, maybe I can get a sequence that includes 't39'. Let's see.\n\nFor example, suppose NT0 \u2192 NT6 NT7, and NT6 \u2192 't83', and NT7 \u2192 't54' or something. But in the given grammar, the terminals are scattered, but if none of the NTs produce 't39', then t39 can't appear in the string. So if the string starts with t39, the answer would be No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 't39' is part of a larger rule. Let me check the NT3 rules because t39 is associated with NT3.\n\nLooking at the NT3 rules:\n\nNT3 \u2192 NT5 NT9,\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT0,\nNT3 \u2192 NT3 NT3,\nand so on. So the only terminals for NT3 are 't72' (twice), and perhaps via other NT rules.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe t39 is a terminal for some NT, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me cross-reference the NTs:\n\nLooking at the productions:\n\n- NT0 produces several terminals like 't23', 't43', 't53', 't63', etc.\n- NT2 produces 't7'\n- NT3 produces 't72' (multiple times)\n- NT5 \u2192 't47' and others\n- NT6 \u2192 't83' and others\n- NT7 \u2192 't54' and others\n- NT8 \u2192 't5', 't61', etc.\n- NT9 \u2192 't60'\n\nSo looking for 't39' in these terminals: I don't see any. The closest is 't37' for NT0 and NT5, but t39 isn't there.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in transcription. Let me check the string again:\n\nThe string is: `t39 t31 t33 t76 t51 t28 t40 t20 t61 t20 t43 t43 t37 t70 t43 t70 t53 t44 t53 t7 t33 t7 t40 t53 t26 t43 t76 t13 t10 t14 t11 t57 t64 t10 t63 t60 t33 t70 t35 t10 t53 t53 t43 t10 t43 t72 t83 t26 t13`\n\nLooking through the list, the only terminals are those defined in the grammar. So t39 must come from an NT that doesn't exist in the grammar.
